Sen. John McCain has one word to describe Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman: Loudmouth.
And that's why the Arizona Republican, a major sports fan, is pulling for the Denver Broncos and quarterback Peyton Manning to win another Super Bowl ring.
"You know everybody is such a Manning fan and that loudmouth from Seattle sort of epitomizes the Seattle team to me, but I'm sure I'm going to get in trouble for that, too," McCain said Tuesday on KFYI radio.
STORY: How Richard Sherman honed his trash talk
Sherman's trash talking Sunday after the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC Championship has become a video classic. In a first-person account for Sports Illustrated, Sherman explained "it was loud, it was in the moment and it was just a small part of the person I am."
McCain, however, saved his sharpest sports-related digs for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made clear he won't forgive the Dodgers for jumping into the swimming pool at Chase Field, home of his favorite Arizona Diamondbacks, after clinching baseball's National League West division.
"Now what we need to do is have the D-backs beat the crap out the Dodgers every time we play them," the senator said. "I will never forget jumping in that swimming pool. I'm telling you, I don't hold a grudge against old political opponents. I hold a grudge for the Dodgers jumping into that swimming pool."
McCain repeated words he first used in a tweet last fall slamming the Los Angeles ballclub: "Talk about no class. Spoiled rich brats."
