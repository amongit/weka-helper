Senators trash talk Super Bowl via Twitter

The trash talking has begun between Colorado and Washington senators about Super Bowl XLVIII.
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., normally a quiet guy, tweeted a dig at the Seattle Seahawks and the team's ubiquitous cornerback, Richard Sherman, in response to a throwdown by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Bennet, of course, is rooting for the Denver Broncos.
noted that Bennet had fun last week tweeting his colleague, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., about the AFC championship game between the Broncos and New England Patriots.
Let's hope Bennett and Murray maintain a Senate-like sense of decorum and don't go off like Sherman did in his postgame rant when the Seahawks won the NFC championship that got them into the Super Bowl.
The big game is Feb. 2 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
