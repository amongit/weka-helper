Michelle Obama, on 'Ellen DeGeneres Show,' Gets Funky
Showing off her moves once again, the first lady is bringing the funk to “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”
In a preview clip of her Monday appearance, Michelle Obama and the comedian groove to Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk” in a choreographed dance routine, hip-shaking and shimmying to the pop hit.






“There is some hip-thrusting,” the first lady, 51, joked, after her microphone fell off, making for a false start to the breakdown session. “There is a lot of it.”


The public will have a chance to join in the dance routine, part of an effort to highlight the first lady’s “Let’s Move!” campaign, during this year’s Easter Egg roll, when the Obama will perform it live at the White House.
