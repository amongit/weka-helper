Sarah Palin: 'I Owe America A Global Apology'
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she owes America a "global apology" for the 2008 GOP presidential ticket's loss to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.
During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Palin spoke about Obama's long-term strategy for defeating the Islamic State -- a militant group formerly known as ISIS or ISIL -- that he laid out in a speech Wednesday night.
"As I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is, 'I owe America a global apology. Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president,'" Palin said.
Palin went on to compare the Islamic State to Hitler and questioned how seriously Obama is taking the group.
"So when Barack Obama, like the rest of us, hear these bad guys, these terrorists, promising that they will raise the flag of Allah over our White House, for the life of me I don't know why he does not take this serious, the threat. Because yes, it's more than a vision," Palin said. "They're telling -- just like Hitler did all those years ago, when a war could've been avoided, because Hitler, too, did not hide his intentions. Well, ISIS, these guys aren't hiding their intentions either."
