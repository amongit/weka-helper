Bad News for the Animal Lover
Conservationists used to celebrate zoos and the like for their ability to aid in the preservation of endangered species, their usefulness as a teaching tool so that people could learn more about the animal kingdom and because they were useful in explaining to children, who were enthralled by the sights and sounds and smells, that this was a big planet that needed to be shared.
No more, now that the so-called green movement has linked up with the fringes of the animal rights movement to create a leading wedge designed to put an end to zoological parks of all kinds.
In Washington state Kevin Ranker, a Democratic member of the state Senate, has introduced legislation that would make it a crime, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $100,000 fine, to hold whales, dolphins or porpoises, known as cetaceans, in aquariums.

One motivation behind Ranker’s bill and other similar efforts around the country, according to the free market-oriented National Center for Public Policy Research is “Blackfish,” an advocacy film that has aired repeatedly on CNN. This even though Jennifer Dargan, CNN's director of public relations, “conceded” to the Center's Jeff Stier – who runs the nonprofit group's risk analysis division – “that the film was ‘acquired’ by the news organization and did not adhere to any of CNN’s journalistic standards,” he said in a release.
The film itself is changing hearts and minds even without being subjected to strict scrutiny, with critics like Stier not given a platform equal to its advocates to offer a rebuttal. And the movement is even reaching U.S. Congress, where California Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman and Adam Schiff last summer attached an amendment to the House Agriculture Appropriations Act to require the United States Department of Agriculture to "conduct and update the science necessary for Animal Welfare Act regulations on captivity of orcas and cetaceans,” meaning whales, dolphins, porpoises and the like, at a cost to the taxpayers of $1 million. In California, a Santa Monica assemblyman authored a bill that would put an end to the display of killer whales, citing the movie as his inspiration. A New York legislator introduced a similar bill even though none of the black and white splendors of the sea are on display anywhere in the state (none are on display in Washington state either, for that matter).

What this all amounts to is the dangerous policy of letting propaganda set science policy in the public square. It’s a tactic that’s been used successfully by those who promote the idea that mankind’s productive activity is causing the planet’s mean temperature to rise over time at an alarming rate and to unacceptable, even destructive levels. Well, I guess if it worked once …
To the animalians backing these ideas, zoos and aquariums are no better than prisons – places inside which nature’s beauty is captured and put on display merely for the amusement of men, women and children in ways that line the pockets of businessmen and women. “Ultimately, the radical animal activist agenda goes well beyond ending human interaction with animals outside of the wild – and zoos and aquariums as we know them. Some of these activists, who hold that animals aren't property to be owned by humans, argue that we shouldn't be allowed to own pets,” Stier said.
It’s really the so-called animal activists who are the selfish ones. They’ve seen the killer whales in the aquarium and the pandas at the zoo and are content, apparently, to let future generations get by with computer simulations and holograms. They’re trying to drive policy by pulling on the heart-strings of children. Policymakers would be foolish to listen to them and should, instead, insure that any change in the laws concerning the care of animals and fish and birds in U.S. facilities must arise out of sound zoological practice and marine science, not out of the radical animal rights agenda and what might look alarming on film.
