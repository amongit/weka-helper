Hillary Clinton should face criminal charges
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Let’s get down to brass tacks: Hillary Rodham Clinton should be criminally charged for failing to turn over her government emails as mandated by law.
It’s not a hard call. While she nominated to be Secretary of State by President Obama, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, she’s just like any other government employee — there were documents she was required by law to sign over upon her departure.

When she stepped down from her post — in the midst of the Benghazi scandal — she would have been required to sign the State Department’s “Separation Statement,” AKA Form 109.
“I have surrendered to responsible officials all classified or administratively controlled documents and material with which I was charged or which I had in my possession, and I am not retaining in my possession, custody, or control, documents,” the form says.
And “I have surrendered to responsible officials all unclassified documents and papers relating to the official business of the Government acquired by me while in the employ of the Department or USIA.”
