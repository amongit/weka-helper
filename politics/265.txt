The GOP Bracket Challenge - NationalJournal.com
Those who avidly follow politics always seek clarity and understanding, simply to figure out what is likely to happen. At this point, at least on the Republican side, we're all going to have to accept that this presidential nomination fight is going last a very long time with no clarity on the horizon.
Despite the best efforts of Republican National Committee members and Chairman Reince Priebus to shorten a process that just about everyone acknowledged went way too long in 2012, this contest is likely to go very long as well. It may not take on the appearance of The Gong Show—the wacky late-1970's TV game show populated by contestants with dubious, if any, talent—as much as 2012 did, but it is very difficult to see anyone emerging early as a clear favorite for the Republican nomination.
While it's pretty safe to say that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is a huge favorite to win the Democratic nomination, my hunch is that even if we absolutely knew today that she would be the nominee, at some point along the way, Clinton will stumble or someone else briefly catch fire, introducing some real element of doubt about the outcome. Whether it is Clinton having been out of the campaign game for a long time and needing time to get back into the political rhythm, simply resistance to the inevitability of her nomination, or even a real revolt on the far left of the party, it is unlikely that she will make it from the opening gate to the finish line without a stumble or spirited challenge.
But it is the Republican contest that today looks more likely to dominate attention. My current theory (in my business you have to have a theory or schematic of an upcoming race) is that there are at least four brackets of candidates and Republican voters, with a competition between GOP contenders to win a spot in the nomination semifinals.
First there is the establishment bracket, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and possibly former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney competing for that semifinal slot. Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina would likely fit into this group. GOP nominees traditionally come from this bracket.
Then there is the conservative governor/former governor slot—with, potentially, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker competing, all seeking to be non-Washington and non-Congress candidates, but each with more conservative, or at least better conservative, credentials than Bush, Christie, or Romney. In this anti-Washington environment, being able to say that you effectively governed, in contrast with Congress and Washington, certainly has some advantages among the non-purist conservatives.
In the third bracket are the more identifiably tea-party candidates, principally Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, but also former Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, possibly former 2008 vice presidential nominee and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and even real-estate mogul Donald Trump (though both Palin and Trump are unlikely to make it past the first lap if they end up entering at all). This bracket is for the "mad as hell and not going to take it anymore" conservatives.
Finally, there is the social, cultural, and religious conservative bracket, made up primarily of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, tapping into the same feelings as the third group but with a distinctly moral dimension.
There are some other entrants who fit less comfortably into these brackets; for example both retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal are hybrids, fitting into both tea-party and the social and religious conservative brackets. While Jindal is obviously a governor, his rhetoric and positioning does not seem to fit with the Kasich, Pence, Perry, Snyder, and Walker group. Even individual contenders within each bracket will have distinct appeals; obviously, Rand Paul has a more libertarian and anti-internationalist (he seems to recoil at the term isolationist) stance than Ted Cruz, who is more a pure conservative without any odd angles attached.
Each of these brackets make up distinct and substantial segments of the Republican electorate, with contestants fighting each other for dominance and the ability to move onto the next level. Theoretically, the establishment bracket winner will face off with the winner of the conservative governor bracket, each competing for the less ideologically hard-lined Republican voters, while the tea-party and religious bracket victors will face off among the most conservative of Republican primary voters.
Of course, this is all a theory. But just as in business, particularly industries such as broadcasting, there is real market segmentation at work, with pools of customers—in this case, voters—who are looking, or at least think they are looking, for the same thing. The people who are thinking about supporting Chris Christie are probably very different from those considering Ben Carson, for example. The one thing that we can count on—and the 2012 GOP fight certainly underscored this—is that there will be twists and turns along this road that no one can anticipate. This is all human behavior, and that is what keeps politics interesting.
