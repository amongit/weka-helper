Public Doubts Obama's ISIS Strategy
Official Washington is debating the use of force against Islamic extremists, but most Americans are still befuddled about exactly how President Barack Obama plans to defeat these violent, ruthless fighters in the Mideast and around the world.
Seventy-three percent of voters say the White House doesn't have a clear strategy for defeating the Islamic extremists, known as ISIS, an increase from 64 percent who felt that way last September, according to the latest Fox News poll. Only 19 percent of voters believe Obama has a clear plan for defeating ISIS, down from 26 percent in September.
Even 54 percent of Obama's fellow Democrats don't think he has a clear plan, up from 44 percent.

Only 42 percent approve of the job Obama is doing in fighting terrorism while 53 percent disapprove, little changed from a month ago. Sixty-eight percent want Obama to get tougher on Islamic extremists and only 26 percent say he is being tough enough.
Obama asked Congress Wednesday to formally authorize the use of U.S. military force against ISIS, which has taken over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. Obama already has ordered extensive airstrikes against the extremists but he wants to do more. And even though he argues that he already has the authority to continue the strikes, he wants Congress to endorse further military action to demonstrate to the world and to the terrorists that America is united behind the administration's anti-ISIS campaign.

The authorization that Obama seeks would expire in three years and forbid "enduring offensive ground combat operations." But it would still give the president authority to order some escalation, such as rescue operations and use of special forces to coordinate airstrikes and conduct other missions.
