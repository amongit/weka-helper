Martin Sheen's Common-Man Aura Wows a Cynical Washington
When Martin Sheen played the role of President Josiah Bartlet in the popular TV drama "The West Wing," he felt a responsibility to make a difference in people's lives. And today he is proud because so many say the show inspired them to enter public service or gave them an idealized vision of what the presidency can be.
"The West Wing" ran from 1999 to 2006, and the fact that it became a hit for so long surprised the cast and creators. It was, after all, a reality-based show about politics and government from a liberal viewpoint, themes that were suspect as television fare. Yet it still resonates. I interviewed Sheen for a public program at the Smithsonian in Washington Tuesday night, and it was clear that the series and the part he played remain touchstones for numerous people. This was certainly true for most of the 500 who crammed into Baird Auditorium to hear former President Bartlet hold forth for an hour and a half. Many were young, and they all came out on a cold, raw night even though many Washington institutions had closed because of a snow storm. They gave him many ovations, hung on every word, and lined up to get his autograph afterward. He happily obliged.

When I showed a clip from one of the most powerful "West Wing" episodes, featuring a presidential aide arranging a funeral ceremony for a homeless Korean war veteran, Sheen began to weep and briefly couldn't speak, brushing away tears. Many in the audience felt the same way.
It illustrated what "The West Wing" meant for millions â€“ a powerful depiction of a president and his staff trying to do the right thing, acting out of principle despite their many frailties and flaws, making mistakes but persevering
Sheen wanted it that way. He said the show's goal was to show that idealism was possible at the highest levels of government and "you've got to follow your heart" even if it comes at great cost. He said he, the rest of the cast and the writers also wanted to show government workers as the "real heroes" of Washington, patriots who have made public service part of their lives.
As I point out in my new book, "Celebrity in Chief: A History of the Presidents and the Culture of Stardom," the show illustrated the positive side of the modern-day intersection of politics, government and show business.
On Tuesday evening, Sheen was true to his image as an unassuming fellow from Ohio who has excelled in a world of preening celebrities. He has appeared in more than 100 films and scores of TV shows, and is still very active.
Sheen, 74, showed up for the event in jeans, a tie and a blue sweater with a hole under the right arm. He was voluble and genial, just the way the audience thought, and hoped, he would be.

Before the program began, Sheen, originally Ramon Antonio Gerardo Estevez, told me that he took his stage name from Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, a spellbinding Catholic prelate who delivered weekly televised sermons while Ramon lived in New York City many years ago. (Sheen has never officially changed his real name.) The actor told how he brought one of his young sons to visit the clergyman, and the boy spilled a box of Jujubes on the floor. Sheen, his son and the prelate all got on their hands and knees to pick up the candies, and the actor never forgot the moment, admiring the bishop for his performance skills in public and his humility in private. Martin Sheen showed on Tuesday night that he has both.
He said liberal activism is an essential part of his life, and he has been arrested many times for civil disobedience. "Acting is what I do for a living but activism is what I do to stay alive," he told the crowd. They gave him another ovation.
