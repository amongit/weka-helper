Obama Blames Message for Midterm Failure
President Obama is admitting that he botched the midterm election campaign by failing to make a compelling argument for voters to support fellow Democrats.
Obama said he and his advisers failed to sell his policies effectively and conceded that it was a "failure of politics." He said he would do better during his final two years in office.

"The buck stops right here at my desk," the president told CBS's "Face the Nation" in an interview broadcast Sunday. "And so whenever, as the head of the party, it doesn't do well, I've got to take responsibility for it."
"It's not enough just to build a better mousetrap," Obama added. "People don't automatically come beating to your door. We've got to sell it. We've got to reach out to the other side and, where possible, persuade."
Obama said the loss of the Senate to the Republicans and the GOP's expansion of its House majority have prompted a "gut check" inside the White House and a reassessment of how to improve the operation.

Polls have consistently found that Obama is unpopular and he was a drag on many Democratic candidates this year, especially Senate candidates in competitive races.
It's also important to point out that Obama is blaming his losses on weaknesses in White House communications strategy and not on the policies themselves or management flaws such as the disastrous rollout of the administration's health care insurance website and setbacks in the U.S. war on Islamic extremists. Obama is following a pattern here. Other presidents also have blamed poor PR for their problems rather than reassessing the policies themselves.
"There are times, there's no doubt about it, where, you know, I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we're trying to do and why this is the right direction," Obama said.
