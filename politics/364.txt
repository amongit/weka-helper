PM has chai pe charcha with Kejriwal, says Centre will think on giving full statehood to Delhi: Sisodia
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told Delhi chief minister-designate Arvind Kejriwal that the Centre will think on the issue of giving complete statehood to Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Manish Sisodia said on Thursday.
Kejriwal and Sisodia met Modi at Prime Minister's official residence - 7, Race Course Road - on Thursday morning. The meeting lasted about 15 minutes. After the meeting, Sisodia told the waiting mediapersons that they invited the PM for Kejriwal's swearing-in ceremony to be held on Saturday.
"We had a cordial talk with PM over tea on the issue of complete statehood for Delhi," said Sisodia, and added, "we invited the PM for the swearing-in but he said that it would not be possible for him to attend it due to prior commitments."
He further said, "We spoke to the PM on giving complete statehood for Delhi as this is an opportune time when AAP government will be in complete majority in Delhi and the BJP government is also in complete majority at the Centre."
The PM told Kejriwal that the Centre will think on the issue of giving complete statehood to Delhi.
