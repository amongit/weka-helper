Bedi was seen taking off her glasses and wiping tears with a handkerchief. Her supporters offered her water from a flask and she gulped a few draughts from it.
Bedi is involved in a war of words with colleague-turned-opponent Aam Aadmi Party's chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal. The slugfest between them seems to be intensifying with each passing day. Bedi has accused Kejriwal of spreading negativity to get media attention and appealed to voters not be manipulated by his campaign.
"Negativity suits him and he believes in negativity, otherwise how would he be in the media. This is his old habit. He is misusing the media. I won't be surprised even if he wants himself to be sent to jail. He just wants to manipulate people," Bedi said.
Hitting back at Bedi, Kejriwal said that she should maintain some decency in politics. "Let Bedi look at me in my eyes and say that I am dishonest. We have worked together for three years. There is decency even in politics," Kejriwal said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also while addressing a rally in Rohini took potshots at the AAP saying that the party's funding scandal exposed their double standards.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also hinted at an independent probe into the allegations. BJP has also claimed that the AAP has been caught red handed.
Striking a defiant note against BJP's mounting attack, Kejriwal dared the government to "arrest" him over the allegations and said his party was ready to face investigation by any central agency including CBI. "The government is in your hands. All the police and investigating agencies are with you. The CBI, Enforcement Directorate, IB and I-T department are with you. If you have the courage why don't you arrest me," he said.
