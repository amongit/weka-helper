Obama Beset by Twin Crises
President Barack Obama is struggling with two national security issues that could have serious consequences for the country and could make or break his second termâ€“the potential for an epidemic of the Ebola virus, and the military gains being made by Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria despite a U.S.-led bombing campaign against them.
White House officials are trying to put the best spin on recent setbacks in the war against the extremists, also known as ISIS or ISIL. "This is going to be a long-term campaign, and there will not be any quick fixes involved," Obama said Tuesday. He gave this assessment during a meeting with military leaders from 20 allied countries near Washington. Obama conceded that there have been "periods of setback" but added: "Our coalition is united behind this long-term effort."

Some White House officials had a somewhat more optimistic take. White House press secretary Josh Earnest, pressed by reporters on whether the United States and its allies were actually winning the war against the extremists, said, "Yes, we are succeeding in this effort."
But the coalition is fraying. Turkey launched air strikes against Kurdish rebels within Turkey instead of attacking the Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq, where the Islamists have been battling other groups of Kurds.
The extremists have been advancing on the Syrian town of Kobani, which Syrian Kurds are trying to defend with the help of U.S.-led air strikes. In Iraq, the extremists are moving closer to controlling Anbar province and key areas near Baghdad.
Obama has made two pledges that may not be compatible. He has promised not to send U.S. combat forces back into Iraq, but he has also promised to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic extremists so they don't use Syria and Iraq as safe havens from which to attack their neighbors and the United States. It may not be possible for Obama to accomplish the goal of defeating the militants without breaking his pledge to keep American troops out of the fight, military strategists say.
The second big security issue relates to Ebola, which Americans may see as a more immediate threat. Sixty-five percent of Americans are concerned about an Ebola epidemic in the United States, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll. Two-thirds support travel restrictions on people entering the United States from West African countries, where Ebola is most prevalent. U.S. officials say that's not necessary. Only 33 percent believe the United States is doing all it can to fight Ebola.
Recent developments haven't been heartening. Thomas Duncan of Liberia died last week of Ebola while he was visiting his family in Dallas. And Nina Pham, a nurse who treated Duncan in Texas, contracted the virus despite wearing protective clothing during the procedures.

Obama is trying to emphasize that he is on top of the situation. Administration officials are regularly updating the news media on the briefings Obama receives about the disease and government actions being taken to combat a widespread outbreak, including added screening at U.S. airports of travelers from West Africa. Obama also has ordered 4,000 U.S. troops to Africa to fight the disease.

Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who initially expressed optimism about the effectiveness of existing measures to control the disease, has changed his approach. "We have to rethink how we address Ebola control because even a single infection is unacceptable," Frieden told reporters. He added that nurse Pham's infection "substantially" changes how public health officials must handle the control of Ebola. "To care for a patient with Ebola requires meticulous attention to detail, and we're looking at every aspect to see how we can make it safer and easier," Frieden said. He added that CDC would have rapid-response teams ready to help hospitals care for Ebola patients from now on.
The political blame game is reaching fever pitch. The Agenda Project, a liberal activist group, says Republican opposition to higher spending for disease control has damaged anti-Ebola efforts. The group has made a television ad making these charges for airing in Kentucky and other states with competitive Senate races in the Nov. 4 election, a spokeswoman for the group said. Some Democratic legislators have echoed this same complaint.
On the other side, a number of Republicans have criticized the administration for a weak response to the Ebola threat. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, referring to the Agenda Project, told Fox News, "They're walking this dangerous path of trying to point out blame on Ebola when, in fact, if you look at the president's record on anything from ISIS to the Secret Service to the CDC to Syria to the border, I mean, you name it and for whatever reason, every single thing the administration, as well as these Democrats running for office, touches, it's not turning to gold, I can tell you that. It's turning into something else."
