Clinton and Streep, Still at the Top
Hearing my Bostonian friend on Hillary Clinton gave me pause. “She energizes the base,” he said. “The Republican base.”
But the Academy Awards gave me a flash of female intuition: Clinton will yet win the leading role at the end of the day – or night – of 2016. Trust me. Better yet, consider this.
Hillary Clinton and Meryl Streep are almost the same person. Almost the same age. Clinton went to Wellesley and Streep went to Vassar in the same generation in the 1960s. They each stood out in their classes, and the young Hillary Rodham gave the class of ’69 commencement speech, a call to arms for new ways of seeing and shaping society. The Seven Sisters College graduates then went to highly competitive – and male – Yale for law school and drama school.

Here’s the thing: Clinton and Streep belonged to the first wave to directly benefit from the women’s movement that took hold in the earth-shaking years of the '60s. As gifted as they are, they stood on the shoulders of that movement. Gates opened in higher education, employment and the law of the land. If there is any rhyme and reason in the American story, theirs is the revolutionary generation that will produce the first woman president.
In their mid-60s, Clinton and Streep are still the creme de la creme of their professions and remain at the peak of their tremendous talents. They never lost their determination and they kept showing up, building a body of work. They each played the most amazing and revolutionary roles on their chosen stages.
Performance art is part of Clinton’s skill set, too, as first lady under duress and as secretary of state paying good-will calls 'round the world for the president who beat her in a close race. Give her this: She’s a sport.
Patience becomes both leading ladies. After “Sophie’s Choice,” Streep waited for years, even decades, to win her second major Oscar, for the next century to come along. At last, she was recently recognized for her portrayal of “The Iron Lady.” (The actress was nominated for her supporting role in “Into the Woods” last night, but did not win.)

My reply to my Bostonian friend is to say that everything Clinton has done in her life, she has done well, from Wellesley to Little Rock to the Senate and so on. Contrary to the assertions of pundits like George Will, the Clinton marriage has stayed together, unlike the moralizing Gores. She does have one stain on her Senate record, though. Clinton’s short-sighted vote for the Iraq War authorization hurt and cut against her in running for president in 2008. She took several years to admit she got it wrong. Apologizing does not come easily to her, nor to most of us.
But Clinton, like Streep, has prepared so well for the ultimate role. She knows her lines. She knows all the players on the world stage. Her character is no mystery, like President Barack Obama’s was when he ran in 2008. We’ve been watching her like a hawk since 1992, through so many dramas and hairdos. No doubt, she's battle-tested and ready for the job in the Oval Office.
The question is whether we the people are ready to welcome a strong woman into the pantheon of presidents.
