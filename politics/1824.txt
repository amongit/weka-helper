A Look Back On Women's Political Leadership After An Election Of Female 'Firsts'
Tuesday's midterm elections resulted in multiple wins for female candidates -- there are now 100 women in Congress for the first time ever -- and a new documentary is highlighting the leaps and bounds women have made in politics over the years.
Grace Lee, the director of "Makers: Women in Politics," discussed women's involvement in political leadership since the 1920s with HuffPost Live's Marc Lamont Hill.
"Even in the '50s ... the most efficient way for a woman to get into Congress was to follow in the steps of her dead husband's," Lee said.
The director also praised the "really inspiring" new generation of women getting into politics. Among them are some of the women who secured big wins in Tuesday's midterms, including Gina Raimondo, the first female governor of Rhode Island, Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia's first female senator; and Massachusetts winner Maura Healey, the first openly gay attorney general in the country's history.
The "Makers" series has also profiled powerful women's trajectories in comedy and business.
