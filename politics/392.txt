Delhi elections: BJP's Kiran Bedi calls RSS a 'very national organisation' that has kept India united
New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party's chief ministerial candidate for Delhi Kiran Bedi on Wednesday lavished praise on the party's parent organisation the RSS calling it a "very nationalist" organisation.
Bedi, who filed her nomination for the Assembly election from Krishna Nagar constituency, said the RSS is a very nationalist organisation that has kept India united.
The statement is quite significant because it comes at a time when the RSS is learnt to be unhappy with the projection of Bedi as the BJP's CM nominee.
Talking about her decision to join the BJP, Bedi said she did so to defeat the "confrontational politics" of Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal.
At one point in time, Bedi was Kejriwal's colleague in Team Anna and had launched agitation along with him. She broke away with him on the issue of forming AAP, saying that like their leader Anna Hazare she too was against party politics and electoral politics.
However, after she made a U-turn to join the BJP, she said she got inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policies.
Meanwhile, commenting on Bedi joining the BJP, Hazare said, "Politics is dirty. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to comment on Kiran Bedi."
Ever since she joined the BJP, Bedi had been trying to contact Hazare but has failed to do so. She has repeatedly called him up but has never been able to talk to him. On Wednesday, Hazare has made his displeasure by maintaining that he did not approve of party politics. In fact, this was the cause of the rift between and Kejriwal too.
