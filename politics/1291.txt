Indiana Gov. Pence Pulls the Plug on Just IN
Well, that didn’t take long: Less than a week after his office announced the creation of his own state news service, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has shut that whole thing down.

On Jan. 27, Pence – a former Republican congressman who’s thinking of joining the GOP’s Family-Sized Presidential Contenders Super Val-U-Pak (now with 50 percent less Palin!) – launched Just IN, a state-run news service that would generate stories about Hoosier State news, presumably positive things about the governor’s office, and pump it to content-starved small papers around the state. Pence even hired a former Indianapolis Star reporter to run the project, perhaps to lend some journalistic credibility to a dubious undertaking.
As Pence could have anticipated with some foresight, the announcement of a taxpayer-funded organization that would pump out good news from the governor’s office provoked an epic Internet trolling. The reactions veered between outrage at co-opting the media, jabs about the governor’s ambition and wisecracks about totalitarianism reminiscent of ‘80s comic Yakov Smirnoff:

Go figure: Indiana Gov. Pence learned that he was planning to start a state-run news website "from press reports" http://t.co/Vrx2S7gJP4
In the typical arc of political scandal, Pence at first downplayed the project, then disavowed it, then pulled the plug while ignoring the notion there was anything wrong with the idea in the first place. From his statement Thursday:
"Rather than developing a new website, I have instructed the Office of Information Technology to update the current public calendar website to ensure that the press and the public have unfiltered and convenient access to all press releases and public meeting notices. The updated calendar will be fully automated and designed to post all press releases and public meeting notices in real time."
To which one Twitter wag responded:
Who had 12:50 p.m. Thursday in the pool? @indystar Gov. Pence kills plans for Just IN news site. http://t.co/BsDSyznK7X
