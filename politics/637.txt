Navy Records Released for the 'American Sniper'
The U.S. Navy has released records related to Navy Seal Chris Kyle's military career in response to a request from MuckRock.
Kyle is depicted in the film "American Sniper" by Bradley Cooper. The move, based off Kyle's autobiography of the same name, is nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor.
The records include an evaluation lauding Kyle's "unsurpassed courage" and saying that "his contributions to success over the insurgency in Iraq cannot be overstated!" Kyle is recommended for several promotions in the records, including for a slot with the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group, commonly known as SEAL Team Six. The elite group completed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
In his book, Kyle discussed his decision not to move forward with tryouts for the team, and wrote that "looking back, I regret not having tried to join." According to his book, Kyle chose not to try out because the team wasn't using snipers as heavily as other teams were, and he wanted to continue in that role.
