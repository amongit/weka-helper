Federal Judges Can Sing and Act, and Not Just in the Courts
Would you rather see a judge sing a folk song or act as the Grand Inquisitor?
A hard choice faced me Saturday. Two great events involving a judge and an amphitheater were on the June docket, one in Pennsylvania and the other in Virginia.
Have you heard of Judge Jed Rakoff? or perhaps Judge David Tatel? They are outstanding federal judges, one in New York and the other in Washington. If there was justice in the world, maybe they'd be on the Supreme Court by now. Rakoff, for example, declared the death penalty unconstitutional in a recent opinion that got overturned.
In the shade of Crum Woods, Rakoff gave the Alumni Collection speech at Swarthmore College in Philadelphia. His class of 1964 graduated 50 years ago. For the College's 150th birthday celebration, he took us on a journey of furthering social justice over the years. He reminded us that it's not just the education you get at a liberal arts college, but what you do with it to give back to the greater good.

Rakoff also reminded his audience of the tumult of the '60s: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy just six months before they graduated and the ongoing civil rights movement. Then the coolest thing happened at the amphitheater: the judge asked a few classmates to come up to play and sing "We Shall Overcome" with him, with all of us. To join hands and sing that anthem. Sure enough, on a blue-skied Saturday morning, a couple hundred of us sang the verses and the tears sprang for a second. What a radiant moment, deep in my heart.
Bryan, a lawyer friend from the class of 1984, said the college, founded by Quakers in the Civil War, was probably one of the few places where everyone still knew the words to the song, originally a spiritual. As an alumna asked to give a talk on Lucretia Mott, one of the school's founders, I could not have missed the gathering for anything. On the other side of the spectrum, how often do you have a chance to go to a late-night dance party by a fragrant rose garden in June? Not often. Lucretia felt transported, too.
So it was that I missed Judge Tatel in his debut as the Grand Inquisitor in a wonderful new period play by author James Reston, Jr. "Galileo's Torch" is the all-too-real drama of the persecution Galileo Galilei endured at the hands of Pope Urban VIII and the Grand Inquisitor back in 1633. It seeks to get at the emotional facts on the ground for the besieged scientist and astronomer.
Poor man, really, all he did was point out that we on Earth are not the center of the sky, stars and other planets. The moons of Jupiter, seen through his telescope, helped him nail the truth of the Copernican theory. Galileo was born the same year as William Shakespeare, 1564, but his time on Earth was rather a rough ride, thanks to the sins of the Roman Catholic Church.

What's also wondrous about Reston's political theater is the constellation of amateur actors Reston rounded up with help from his friends, who live on very different planets, politically. A group of prominent Washingtonians who have houses in Rappahonnock County in Virginia got together and the production took on a life of its own. The play was performed in a new stone amphitheater, built by John B. Henry on his land. He urged Reston to turn his book on Galileo into a play.
The back story became the improbable mixing and matching of Washington's political class.
Appointed by President Clinton, Tatel became his role beautifully and inspired awe in character and costume. Invited to a rehearsal in his District courtroom by the playwright, I was fascinated by how blind "justice" can be to the truth â€“ and as it happens, Tatel is blind. Galileo's interrogation, in which he is presumed guilty, is the stuff of nightmares and results in house arrest for the rest of his days. Tall, thin C. Boyden Gray, counsel in the first Bush White House, wears Pope Urban's white hood well and looks at home in his stern visage. I'm a bit scared of him, actually.
Also cast in parts in the play: the journalist Andrew Cockburn and hard-core conservative author Richard Viguerie. They are probably on the planets farthest apart, but who's measuring? Back in the 17th century, it's hard to tell who's closer to the sun.
