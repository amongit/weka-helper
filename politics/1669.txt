Democratic Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Election Is 'Neck And Neck'
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The head of the Democratic Party says the mid-term campaign for control of the Senate is "a neck and neck" situation.

Florida Congresswoman Deborah Wasserman-Schultz says Nov. 4 isn't a referendum on President Barack Obama. And she's brushing off talk that endangered Democratic Senate incumbents are trying to avoid associating with President Barack Obama.

She tells MSNBC Wednesday that Obama was on the ballot in 2008 and 2012, not now.

Yet, Wasserman-Schultz cites his economic record when asked about Democratic prospects, saying "we have pulled ourselves out, thanks to his leadership."

Former Democratic chairman Howard Dean, appearing on the same network, says "you can't get away with that. ... The president is on the ballot."

Republicans could recapture the Senate from Democrats with a net gain of six seats.
