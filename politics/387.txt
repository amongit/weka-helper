Delhi elections: BJP alleges AAP workers coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh
New Delhi: Continuing with its announcement made on Thursday, the BJP asked five questions on the second day from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on the Delhi Assembly elections.
Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman again trained guns on Kejriwal and this time pointed out that AAP's website showed volunteers coming from Bangladesh and areas near Pakistan.
Her five questions were, "Why is AAP taking the help of anti-national forces? Why has AAP not submitted its poll expenses to the Election Commission. Why are AAP's female leaders like Shazia Ilmi leaving the party? Why is AAP not respecting constitutional institutions like the Election Commission by brazenly violating poll norms? Why did AAP not strengthen the Delhi Lokayukta after praising the BJP government's model in Uttarakhand?"
On Thursday, Sitharaman and Skill Development Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy had initiated asking five questions from Kejriwal. The questions were: "Why did AAP compromise on principles for power? What happened to AAP's promise of acting against Sheila Dikshit? While championing cause of common man, why did AAP ask for SUVs? Why did Kejriwal use a chartered flight and fly business class? What happened to the AAP promise that they won't take VIP benefits?"
