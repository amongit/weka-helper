Those Who Attack Koch Funding at Universities Assault Academic Freedom - US News
Tomorrow’s new recruits to Occupy Wall Street and other social movements are today’s juniors and seniors on America’s college campuses. They’re busy waging a kind of war against the free market system, the very thing that makes their attendance at college or university and hopes for a prosperous future possible. They’re loading themselves up with debt they won’t be able to repay, if they succeed at biting off the hand that feeds them.
It’s alarming that their arguments have become couched in the language of preserving “academic freedom.” It’s their rallying cry when they attack professors and institutions they regard as suspect, leading them to compromise the very ideals of academic freedom they claim they’re trying to protect. If they miss the irony, it’s probably because English 101 was held at the same time as "Hollywood & Washington: Influencing the Political Process through Mass Culture" so they missed the lecture on rhetorical devices.
In what Inside Higher Ed described as “[a] tug of war ... brewing at the University of Kansas,” Art Hall – a popular lecturer who heads the Center for Applied Economics there – is being assailed by a student group that alleges his relationship to philanthropists Charles and David Koch is worthy of inquiry, if not a full-blown investigation.

Hall does not hide his ties to the Kochs. He makes no secret of the fact that he once worked as an economist for a group connected to them or that his academic center – really just a nine-by-nine foot office on the third floor of the university’s business school – was founded with seed money from and continues to be funded by the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation. Moreover he’s disclosed this when testifying before the state Legislature in support of tax cuts and in opposition to state-funded subsides for so-called renewable energy like wind power.
He is a genuine academic and the association of MBA students twice voted him “Teacher of the Year.” Despite this, his student opponents call him a “stealth lobbyist” and are trying to use Kansas’ open records law to force him to turn over a decade's worth of emails. Apparently the group objects to his teaching of market-based economic principles as though somehow the ideas he discusses in his lectures could only spring from a mind unduly influenced by the sponsors of his research.
The people who want his emails want them to mount a fishing expedition to try and tie the Kochs, selected advocacy organizations, a few politicians and other progressive bogeymen together into one nice, neat bundle – no doubt so they can rail against them on television, in fundraising appeals and in the halls of Congress.

Hall has filed suit to block the request, arguing it would have a chilling effect on research, teaching and academic freedom – his own, as well as that undertaken by others. “If my private, personal communications are released, I will not be the only one whose academic freedom is jeopardized,” he wrote in an op-ed published in the Lawrence Journal-World. The student group’s demand for his electronic correspondence, he continued, “could ultimately jeopardize the academic freedom of any scholar at a public institution of higher education.”
Do not be fooled. This is about more than one professor with ties to people and institutions some progressives don’t like on just one campus; it’s about a coordinated campaign carefully designed to appear spontaneous and executed through social media so the fingerprints are harder to find, let alone identify.
Those who have looked into the issue closely found that students leading just the efforts directed at the Kochs and institutions affiliated with them have what can be described as multiple connections to each other. They also apparently have ties to those who might be described as “climate warriors" and proponents of the idea that global warming is a by-product of human industrial productivity needing to be reined in by government regulation.

In the current narrative, people like liberal billionaires Tom Steyer and George Soros and those like them who fund all kinds of things based at universities are heroes, while the Kochs and those like them are goats. Hence the existence of “UnKoch My Campus,” a project whose partners include Greenpeace and Citizen Engagement Laboratory’s Forecast the Facts project. Its operating theory is that that conservative philanthropy directed at college campuses can only be part of a larger effort at, as one person involved in an effort to eliminate Koch funding on his campus, told NPR was “propaganda.”
“They want their view taught, and its amounts to propaganda rather than assisting education,” Ray Bellamy, who at the time of his interview was head of surgery at the Tallahassee campus of Florida State University’s College of Medicine. This effort, which is more centrally directed and widespread than it may appear, involves faculty members as well as students which makes one wonder whether anyone involved can read the handwriting on the wall.
The same argument is playing out on selected campuses all across America. On Tuesday, Charles Koch and Papa John’s International founder John Schnatter together announced a combined gift of $6.3 million to establish The John H. Schnatter Center for Free Enterprise at the University of Louisville. Its mission, university officials said, will be to examine how free enterprise and entrepreneurship can affect a person's well-being.
According to University of Louisville, as reported by Louisville Business First, Schnatter’s foundation is providing most of the money for the new center with the Charles Koch Foundation adding just over $1.5 million to the pie. The university said it plans to use the funding to recruit and hire two tenure-track professors, a few staffers and will offer graduate and undergraduate classes and seminars, symposiums and a speaker series on free enterprise. It may even fund a few Ph.D. candidates. As soon as the news gets out, however, you can bet those who think only liberals and progressive foundations should be allowed to endow university institutions will pounce.

In one sense this is an argument about donor intent, about whether people who give money to a college or university can place conditions on how it is spent so that the money ends up being used for the purpose or purposes for which it was intended. Frankly, this says more about the trustworthiness of people running today’s institutions of higher learning than it says about possible nefarious intent on the part of those making grants. Universities and colleges have failed in the past to use monies gifted for specific purposes as intended (think of Lee Bass’s $20 million gift to Yale University to establish a formal program devoted to the study of Western civilization that ultimately was returned after no such program was established but only after a protracted argument). Until someone finally lays down the law, it is easy to believe colleges and universities will continue to do so as long as they don’t get caught at it
Meanwhile the student groups fronting for other interests continue to make unsubstantiated claims that are repeated, time and again, by people who cover the issue without apparently investigating their validity. None of them appear to have much substance, and, indeed, there is no case one can point to where the facts back up the charge. Nevertheless, the echo chamber continues to repeat them over and over again.
There is nothing inherently evil or insipid about the free market. It is the reason that mankind no longer lives in caves. It is the origin of our wealth and health. That people live longer, are better educated, have higher standards of living and are currently experiencing the wondrous unfolding of a technologically driven quantum leap in the course of events of man is a direct result of the marriage between buyer and seller. It’s also the reason there are so many colleges and universities in the United States.

No other economic system has done so much for so many. Teaching how and why it works remains a worthwhile enterprise. Hall is fighting back, making his arguments in court on the grounds that private communications are protected under an exemption contained within the Kansas Open Records Act. It may be a loophole, but it is a persuasive one; the judge hearing the case agreed there is substance to the argument and has ordered the release of any documents stopped until the court can review them.
That amounts to a temporary redoubt, but it is hardly a safe place to hide in an ongoing battle that likely will not end anytime soon. Having established a foothold on America’s campuses thanks to passionate but ill-informed, idealistic students and instructors who should know better but don’t, principles will have to be set down that protect professors from the prying eyes of academic activists funded by nosy nabobs who, it should be pointed out, have a number of propaganda projects of their own underway.
Private money has a place in the world of research and education. So does public money which, it should be pointed out, often comes with strings of its own. More frequently than not the privately funded projects produce the best returns. It would be a shame to see them disappear along with the academic freedom of those doing the research behind them. Perhaps taxpayers have the right to know how public dollars are spent and just who is saying what to whom when the public is footing the bill. Of course when that approach was tried just a few years ago, when a state attorney general tried to investigate the work of a publicly funded scholar working at a publicly funded university on the grounds that it all may have been part of an effort to help “cook the books” on global warming, the academy rose up in arms almost as one to complain that such an investigation was a violation of the academic freedom of the scholars and institutions involved. Do they even teach what irony is anymore after you get out of high school?
