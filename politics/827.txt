Obama Touts Racial Progress in Selma
FROM THE ARCHIVES
President Barack Obama's focus on racial issues has reached a crescendo, and he seems intent on emphasizing the cause of racial justice as much as he can during his final two years in the White House.
Obama is trying to connect the struggle for African-American rights with other struggles in American life, such as the battles for the rights of women, immigrants, gays and people with disabilities. He portrays U.S. racial history not only as a tale of prejudice and an illustration of America's flaws, but also an uplifting story of bravery and the eventual triumph of American ideals.
He has tried to walk the line between negativity and positivism throughout his presidency and, before that, in his presidential campaign of 2008, pointing out how much still needs to be done to end racism but at the same time emphasizing how much progress has been made. As I pointed out in my book "Family of Freedom," Obama has for years "blended the thread of black and white relationships with a broader sense of diversity in the country. As he made clear in the [2008] campaign, Obama does not see America solely through the lens of black and white, but with a larger perspective of racial, ethnic, gender, and other differences." Obama has consistently said he wasn't trying to forget "the sins of our past,"' such as slavery and segregation, but felt that the country had moved firmly toward fairness and tolerance highlighted by his election as the first African American president.
This is what he did again in a speech Saturday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a bloody civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965.
Obama said, "We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching toward justice."
Obama linked his soaring rhetoric with current policy proposals, such as winning congressional approval for strengthening the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A Supreme Court decision in 2013 voided key parts of the law, with a majority of justices concluding that these provisions were outdated. The ruling allowed nine states to change their election laws without the federal approval that the original law required. Obama wants such provisions restored.
Obama also called for improvements in the way police departments interact with minorities and reform of the criminal justice system to reduce racial disparities.
Obama told an estimated 40,000 people in Selma, "What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people – the unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many – coming together to shape their country's course? What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?"

Obama's conservative critics say he is dwelling too much on the downside of U.S. history and not the laudable side such as the U.S. role in defeating Nazi Germany and imperial Japan during World War II, and the American Civil War fought to preserve the Union and end slavery.
But Obama shows no sign of letting up. He has also undertaken a campaign to inspire young African-Americans to get a good education and persevere to overcome whatever discrimination and disadvantages they face.
