Scott Walker Admits That He Flip-Flopped On Immigration
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) admitted on Sunday that he had completely changed his stance on immigration and that he now has a much tougher position on undocumented individuals living in the United States.
"I don't believe in amnesty, and part of the reason why I've made that a firm position is I look at the way this president has mishandled that issue," Walker said during an interview on "Fox News Sunday."
"I think the better approach is to enforce the laws and to give employers, job creators the tools like E-Verify and other things to make sure the law is being upheld going forward," he said.
But pressed by host Chris Wallace on how Walker could reconcile that with his past support for comprehensive immigration reform and 2013 comments in which he said that he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Walker admitted that his position had shifted.
"My view has changed, I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that, sometimes they don't," Walker said. "I look at the problems we’ve experienced over the last few years. I talked to governors on the border and others out there, I’ve talked to people all across America, and the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works, a legal immigration system that works."
Walker's newer hard-line immigration stance draws distance between him and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), a potential 2016 rival for the White House, who has defended a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
