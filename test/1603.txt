Who Throws A Shoe? Honestly, Ronnie Price Of The Lakers Did
Attention NBA players: Throwing shoes at opponents or the ball will be against the rules during the 2014-2015 season.
Los Angeles Lakers guard Ronnie Price learned this the hard way during a preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday. After losing his right shoe and turning the ball over during a botched offensive sequence, Price seemed to try an unorthodox defensive ploy. He picked up his shoe and tossed it in the direction of the Warriors' Andre Iguodala, who had scooped up the loose ball and was dribbling toward the far rim.
Price's heave seemed to be an attempt to disrupt Iguodala's dribble or knock the ball away. It did not work. It did result in a technical foul.
