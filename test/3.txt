Mobility "like a drug" says CEO of property buyer's agent (full interview)
Ben Handler, co-founder and CEO of property buyers' agent Cohen Handler, provides insights from his organisation's experience of implementing mobility tools. Handler discusses the client service and collaboration benefits that accrued, and advises other businesses to get on the mobility train before it leaves the station. "The phone is like a drug, people are addicted to their phoneâ€¦and if you can't work out a way to get to your phone, to connect with your customers, to be connecting with your group, then you've missed the boat."
