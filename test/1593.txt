The Highest-Paid Quarterback In The NFL This Season Got Benched
By Aaron Wilson, National Football Post
The Chicago Bears are starting Jimmy Clausen at quarterback and have benched a struggling Jay Cutler.
Cutler has gone 5-9 as a starter and had three interceptions in a loss to the New Orleans Saints on Monday.
Cutler leads the NFL with 24 turnovers.
Cutler is the highest-paid offensive player in the NFL this season at $22.5 million.
"We haven't been able to do the things that we want to get done," Bears coach Marc Trestman said. "We're working towards that. But the answer to that is obvious. I'm trying to give you the most truthful answer, and that is, we've seen moments of it, but it's not where we need to go. It's not where we need to be. But it's not all about Jay. It's about our entire offense, working together to get it done."
Clausen is a former Carolina Panthers second-round draft pick from Notre Dame.
