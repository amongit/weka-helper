James Flacco Is Not An Elite Quarterback But Might Now Be An Enemy Of North Korea
The Baltimore Ravens may want to double check the security of their emails after President Barack Obama sort of named the team's quarterback, Joe Flacco, while discussing an international controversy involving Sony, North Korea, hackers and actor James Franco.
"I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco," Obama said during a press conference on Friday, via NFL.com.
For comparison, here is a look at Franco and Flacco:

Obama's comments came one day after Sony canceled plans for the release of "The Interview," a film starring Franco and Seth Rogen. The comedy is about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and is believed to be the cause of a cyberattack that leaked many sensitive Sony emails and documents. The FBI announced on Friday that there is information indicating North Korea is responsible for the attack.
The Super Bowl-champion quarterback seemed to get a kick out of the incident, tweeting at Obama and Franco:
.@barackobama It's James Franco, not James Flacco ;)

As noted by SB Nation, those on Twitter not in the extended Flacco family used the opportunity to crack a joke about the perennial debate over the signal caller's "elite" status:
Obama just called James Franco "James Flacco" and everyone tweeted the same joke. http://t.co/EQBqj1jE6K pic.twitter.com/43bsoRPYjd

The name was such a hit that Slate created "The James Flacco Name Generator." It gave readers a chance to "Obamify" their name. According to the name generator, Franco's co-star in the film would go by Seth Romo:
