Ottawa Senators Player Gets Penalty, Wanders Into Wrong Penalty Box
They say home is where the heart is.
Well, that was definitely true for Ottawa Senators forward David Legwand, who wandered into the wrong penalty box after a tripping call in Nashville on Thursday night.
To be fair, Nashville used to be his home turf. The game was Legwand's first back in the city after being traded last season from the Predators -- where he'd played since the late 1990's -- to the Detroit Red Wings.
According to Wayne Scanlan, a hockey columnist for the Ottawa Citizen, Legwand laughed off the misstep.
Legwand laughed about going to the wrong penalty box. "Fifteen years of going to the same box," he said.

We're laughing, too.
