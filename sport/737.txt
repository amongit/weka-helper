Mike Tyson Boxing, 15 months: With Evander Holyfield in control of their 1997 rematch (he won the first fight too) Tyson, who was upset with what he believed were his opponent's headbutting tactics, resorted to biting and spitting on to the canvas a chunk of Holyfield's right ear. Shockingly, the referee allowed the fight to go on, and Tyson promptly tried to take another bite out of the other ear.

Latrell Sprewell Basketball, 68 games: Sprewell, a former NBA player for Golden State Warriors, earned a year-long, or 65-game, ban in 1997 for choking his coach during training, then returning for another assault after the session ended.

Eric Cantona
Football, eight months & suspended prison sentence: The combustible Manchester United player saw red on the pitch and then off it, committing his infamous kung-fu kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, who had descended to the hoardings to abuse the Frenchman.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Billy Coutu
Ice hockey, life (later commuted to 2 1/2 years): Boston Bruin attacked two referees and started an on-rink brawl, during the 1927 Stanley Cup final.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gilbert Arenas
Basketball, 50 games: In 2009 Arenas reacted to Washington Wizards team-mate Javaris Crittendon's demands to pay up after a card game by brandishing a pistol. Crittendon reacted by doing likewise. All this took place in the Wizards' changing room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ron Artest
Basketball, life (reduced to 73 games): As an on-court fight broke out between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons in 2004, a fan threw a drink at the Pacers' Ron Artest, who stormed into the crowd and sparked a brawl between players and fans. Artest has since, with no irony, changed his name to Metta World Peace.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danny Williams
Rugby league, 18 weeks: Williams claimed he had no recollection of the sucker punch that put fellow NRL player Mark O'Neill in hospital with a fractured cheekbone in 2004, due to being dazed by an earlier tackle. His unusual defence was given short shrift.
