Russian marathon star Liliya Shobukhova banned for two years and stripped of medals for doping violation

Russian athlete Liliya Shobukhova, one of the most successful marathon runners in history, has been banned for two years for a doping violation and stripped of all her results since October 2009 - including her 2010 London Marathon title.
The 36-year-old will also lose the three Chicago Marathon crowns she won from 2009 and 2011 as well as her status as the second fastest female marathon runner of all time behind world record-holder Paula Radcliffe.
A furious Radcliffe, who has been a lifelong campaigner against drug cheats, said on Twitter: "Fraud on so many levels. So much money effectively stolen in appearance fees, winnings and endorsements."
Shobukhova's suspension was announced by the Russian athletics federation after "abnormal haematological curves" were found in her biological passport. The irregularities on her blood profile were indicative of a doping offence.
The athlete still has the right of appeal but if the violation is confirmed she will also be required to repay all prize money and appearance fees from the past five years, including the million dollars she banked for twice being crowned overall winner of the World Marathon Majors (WMM) - the championship that comprises the six major city marathons of London, New York City, Chicago, Boston, Berlin and Tokyo.

Nick Bitel, the chief executive of the London Marathon and a member of the WMM general council, said: "WMM will continue to hold a stern line and supports all measures to ensure the integrity of the athletes competing in their races.
"Cheats need to understand that they are not welcome in our sport and that they will be caught."
The annulment of Shobukhova's 2010 London Marathon victory means that Ethiopian Aselefech Mergia will be promoted to champion, with her compatriots, Bezunesh Bekele and Askale Tafa, being moved up to second and third place.
Shobukhova also finished runner-up in the 2011 London race and her silver medal will now go to Kenyan Edna Kiplagat, this year's champion, with Bekele being elevated to the bronze.
The Russian's third Chicago triumph in 2011 came in a super-quick time of 2hr 18min 20sec, putting her second on the all-time list behind Radcliffe, but that will also be erased from the record books.
London Marathon organisers said they were disappointed with the news and confirmed that they would be ordering Shobukhova to repay the money she earned from the 2010 and 2010 races.
Hugh Brasher, the race director, said: "London Marathon is at the forefront of the fight against doping in our sport and we are very proud to have been the first major marathon to introduce blood-testing for all of our elite competitors prior to each event.
"This mandatory blood testing commenced at the London Marathon in 2002 and has continued with all our elite competitors throughout. As one of the world's leading marathons, we continue to work very closely with UK Anti-Doping, the IAAF and WADA with the aim of eradicating drug taking in our sport."
Shobukhova's violation is a further blow to the credibility of Russian athletics, which has been rocked by scores of drug cases in recent years.
A total of 44 Russian athletes were serving drug suspensions in the run-up to last year's World Championships in Moscow.
