An eight-year-old French boy died on Sunday after he was hit in the head by an ice hockey puck that flew into the stands at a professional match in Dunkirk.
The tragedy occurred three minutes before the end of the second tier French championship match between Dunkirk and Riems on Saturday evening.
The boy, named only as Hugo, was hit on the ear and suffered cardiac arrest. Rescue workers on site were able to revive him, but he later died of his injuries in hospital.
A puck weighs around six ounces and can travel at more than 112 miles per hour when hit during a hockey match.
An inquiry has been opened to determine why the accident happened, but the rink was built to the required standards.

"It's hard. Everyone knows each other, everyone knows the kid," said Dunkirk Mayor Patrice Vergriete.
On Sunday afternoon, some 400 people - including a lot of children - gathered in front of the ice skating rink to lay flowers.
This type of accident is extremely rare, and has never happened before in France.
But in North America where the sport is extremely popular, there have been several such tragedies.
The latest occurred in 2002 when Brittanie Cecil, 13, was killed when a puck was deflected into the stands in Ohio.
