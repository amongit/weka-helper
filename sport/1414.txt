Wayne Odesnik: US tennis player banned for 15 years
18 March 2015 Last updated at 17:59
American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been given a 15-year ban after a second doping violation.
Odesnik, 29, tested positive for several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition urine tests in December and January.
The 15-year ban means he will not be eligible to return until January, 2030.
Odesnik, currently ranked 267th, was given a two-year ban in 2010 after being found guilty of possessing human growth hormone (HGH).
He was stopped by Australian customs officials and found to have eight vials, each containing six milligrams of the performance-enhancing substance HGH, in his baggage.
The former world number 77 has always denied taking HGH and his two-year ban was cut to 12 months after he gave "substantial assistance" to the International Tennis Federation (ITF).
Odesnik's latest ban is the result of tests by the ITF anti-doping programme and the US anti-doping body, Usada, during December and January .
His results at this year's Happy Valley Challenger event, Australian Open and Maui Challenger event will be disqualified and the ranking points and prize money forfeited.
British number one Andy Murray appeared to support the decision to ban Odesnik, tweeting: "Bye bye Wayne... Good riddance".
