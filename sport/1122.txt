Surfer catches waves with GoPro helmet camera
7:01PM BST 12 May 2014
Snowboarders, skateboarders, base-jumpers and other extreme sport junkies use them, but now surfers are getting in on the Go Pro camera action too.
While surfing in Oahu, Hawaii, Brandon Rosa decided to take some mounts he had rigged together for a upcoming snowboarding trip and test them out, capturing some amazing shots in the process.
Rosa said: “I got the idea from snowboarders. I made it for my next snowboard trip but figured I might as well try them in the ocean first. I don’t think anyone surfed with this mount before.”
