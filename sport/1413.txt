Women's Super League Two 2015 club-by-club season preview
Sunderland lifted the Women's Super League Two title in 2014
18 March 2015 Last updated at 13:08
Double the chances of promotion, add a sprinkling of international talent and you have the recipe for a bigger and better Women's Super League Two season.
The 10 teams that make up English football's second tier have never had more to play for, nor has the level of competition been higher outside the game's top flight.
For the first time, the top two teams will be promoted to WSL 1 as part of a two-year process to expand the competition from eight teams to 10 by 2017.
Everton, who won the Women's FA Cup as recently as 2010, lead the way as they look to make an immediate return to WSL 1 after their 21-year stay in the top flight ended last season.
But the Toffees face stiff opposition for a place in the top two, with an influx of internationals joining the ranks.
In a busy close season, clubs have moved to bolster their squads, with Yeovil Town setting the standard by making what they called the "biggest signing in club history" when they brought in England defender Corinne Yorston from Champions League quarter-finalists Bristol Academy.
BBC Sport takes a look at the clubs battling it out in WSL 2 this term.

"We are all buzzing, we just want to get going now."
