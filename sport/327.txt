Ping-pong, whiff-whaff or table tennis?

Boris Johnson was right to claim, in a typically eccentric speech in Beijing, that the Olympics was bringing ping pong home to London. The game did start on the dining tables of Victorian England. But he was wrong to suggest it was called ‘whiff whaff’ in the early days. The very first name was ‘gossima’, used by the Jacques games company which brought out the first set in the 1880s. The name and game was a failure. But they re-launched it as Ping Pong, after the distinctive ping sound of the ball hitting the table, and the pong sound of the ball hitting the bats, which were like drums, with vellum stretched over a frame.
Jacques trademarked Ping Pong in 1901, forcing rivals to adopt alternative names. Slazenger went with Whiff-Whaff, which had been an early nickname (but its first recorded use is long after gossima). However, Table Tennis was adopted by the majority, including the new sport’s official association. The name stuck, though traditionalists prefer ping pong.
