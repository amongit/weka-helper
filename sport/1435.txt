Andy Murray's defeat by Borna Coric in the Dubai Championships had more to do with him wanting to prepare for the Davis Cup, according to Andre Agassi.
Britain's Murray, 27, was beaten 6-1 6-3 by the Croatian, 18, on Thursday.
American Agassi told BBC Sport the Scot wanted to be "preparing for what he probably is really valuing - that is the Davis Cup".
Murray has been named in Great Britain's squad to face the United States in Glasgow from 6-8 March.
The nations met at the same stage of the competition last year, with a Murray-inspired GB defeating the USA 3-1 in San Diego.

The world number three warmed up for Britain's first World Group contest at home since 1999 with a disappointing performance against Coric, ranked 84, in the Dubai quarter-finals.
Eight-time Grand Slam champion Agassi added: "I don't begrudge him having certain priorities.
"The truth is he is experienced enough now to make the necessary adjustments that he can at least be at his best for what he values most."
Agassi, in the UK to promote his own-brand fitness equipment, believes Murray will have a "fantastic" 2015 after reaching the Australian Open final.
Asked why the Scot has often struggled to match the year-round consistency of Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, Agassi added: "Granted, I think he should be better - when I see him in full flight, I hold him right up there in the highest of esteem.
"His skill-set on a tennis court is really unique. I think he's in for a fantastic year.
"If he can get through the clay season, keeping his confidence up, he's going to be a huge factor in the second half of the year."
