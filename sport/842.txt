Derry~Londonderry~Doire crossed the Race 8A line in third followed by Qingdao in fourth place.
Once the teams have crossed the finish line of Race 8A, the teams will join the rest of the fleet and motor sail from the finish line to a restart point in the South China Sea for Race 8B.
Race officials will keep a close eye on prevailing conditions in the event that significantly better progress will be made by continuing to motor sail to Singapore rather than recommence racing under sail.

Race Director Justin Taylor said: “Despite the frustrating weather conditions, this has proved to be an extremely exciting and challenging stage of the race.
A number of teams took a more northerly route which paid dividends. But as the wind filled over the past couple of days there were a number of front runners in contention for strong finishes across the line.”
The race schedule into Singapore has had to be revised because of the unseasonal weather delays that have been experienced.
The estimated arrival window into One15 Marina at Sentosa Cove is now Feb 13-14 with the Race 9 start to Qingdao pushed back to Feb 18. Places for Race 8 into Singapore will be awarded based on total cumulative time racing parts A and B.
Independent Clipper Race weather consultant Simon Rowell explains: “The weather has been unusual in that there have been two tropical depressions along the race route, which has only happened once in the previous 20 years.
These have both given rise to stronger NW head winds along the north coast of Papua New Guinea followed by a period of very light winds before the NE Trades re-establish themselves. This has made the progress of the Clipper Race Fleet very stop/start, and is the reason for the slow overall progress since leaving the Solomon Sea.”
Skipper of Team Garmin, Mark Burkes reflects on his tactical approach to the race:
“Our plan, once north, was always to use the south-flowing current on the east coast of Mindanao, which we have done with some success (bearing in mind we still have very light breeze from behind).
“Unfortunately, the wind hole that covered the front runners filled in much earlier than was forecast, such are the vagaries of sailing, and with their better angle, as soon as they started rolling again it was inevitable that we would drop down the fleet as quickly as we had risen up it.”
