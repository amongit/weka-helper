Cavaliers forward Love returns after sitting 2 games
INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) -- Cavaliers starting forward Kevin Love will play Wednesday night against Brooklyn after sitting two games to rest.
Love denied that a back problem that has been an issue at various times during his first season with Cleveland is what caused him to sit out games against Orlando and Miami.
''Me resting had nothing to do with my back,'' Love said following the team's morning shoot-around at Cleveland Clinics Courts. ''Coach (David Blatt) approached me. I was playing heavy minutes and he came to me and asked if I'd sit a game or two - and that's all it was.''
Love missed games earlier this season with back spasms. The seven-year veteran, who has never played in an NBA postseason, wants to get his body ready for the playoffs.
''Everybody is focusing on their health,'' he said. ''Everyone wants to have a full roster come playoff time. This is my first experience going through it.''
Love is averaging 16.8 points and 10.1 rebounds in 34.4 minutes - his fewest in a non-injury season since 2008-09, his first in Minnesota. With Cleveland, he has missed two games with his back, one for an eye injury and the past two.
The Cavaliers, who have won 13 straight home games, have 13 regular-season games left. They currently have the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference.
