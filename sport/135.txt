Mauresmo elected to International Tennis Hall of Fame
NEW YORK (AP) -- Two-time major champion Amelie Mauresmo was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame on Monday.
Mauresmo won both the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2006. She was No. 1 for 39 weeks in her career, becoming the first Frenchwoman to reach the top of the computer rankings since they were introduced in the 1970s.
''It's an extraordinary honor to have my career celebrated alongside the greatest champions of our sport, people who I have admired so greatly all my life,'' she said.
Mauresmo was known more for letting leads slip away in big Grand Slam matches earlier in her career before her breakthrough in 2006. She's now breaking boundaries in a new way, coaching one of the world's top men's players, Andy Murray.
Also elected Monday in the recent player category was wheelchair tennis star David Hall of Australia. The six-time Paralympic medalist won nine titles at the Australian Open and eight at the U.S. Open.
Nancy Jeffett was elected in the contributor category. She helped establish the Maureen Connolly Brinker Tennis Foundation and was one of the first promoters of women's pro tennis.
The induction ceremony is July 18 in Newport, Rhode Island.
