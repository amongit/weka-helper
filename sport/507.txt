Arsenal were made to work unexpectedly hard for a victory sealed by two first-half goals form Olivier Giroud, as they made a successful star to their now annual early spring post-Champions League exit phase of the campaign.
Newcastle showed glimpses of fight, especially after the break, in their efforts to dispel the suspicion that, mentally at least, they are on the beach. Nevertheless, Arsene Wenger's side kicked sand in their faces, and a liberal amount at that, as they dominated for 45 minutes.
In the end Arsenal were the ones more welcoming of the final whistle, a scenario that seemed barely credible as they cruised into a two goal lead to strengthen their grip on third place in the Premier League, a point behind Manchester City in second.
