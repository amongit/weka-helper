Stay up to date with the latest player signings, moves and speculation from all the counties.
Counties are allowed to field two overseas players in Twenty20 games, with up to four registered for that competition, although only two can be registered at any one time, and registrations must be for a minimum of 10 days.
Only one overseas player is permitted in the County Championship and One-Day Cup competitions.
Also shows, where relevant, players' previous counties
KPK: Kolpak contract
REL: Released
RET: Retired
YTH: From youth teams
EUP: European Union passport

Kolpak contracts are signed by foreign players, using a loophole in European Union law to avoid counting against the quota of one overseas player per club.
