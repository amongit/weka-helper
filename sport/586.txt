Ikechi Anya declares Scotland 'confident of beating England' ahead of clash with Auld Enemy

The Watford midfielder Ikechi Anya believes that Scotland will be better able to gauge their current standing in the game after the challenge match against England at Parkhead on Tuesday evening.
The Glaswegian with the Thames Valley accent (he moved to Oxford from Castlemilk aged nine) regards the meeting with the Group E leaders as a litmus test as Gordon Strachan and his rejuvenated squad attempt to end their 18-year exile from the finals of major tournaments.
World champions Germany are the only nation to have defeated Scotland in their last 10 outings, six of which have been won and Anya is convinced that he and his team-mates can extend that impressive sequence against the English.
“The England game will be a test but we’ve had them before,” he said. “Germany and Poland are very good teams and we performed well against them away from home.
“I think we can beat England. We’re confident that we can win every game, especially at home. It will let us know where we are in the footballing world.

“The atmosphere against Ireland was electric but I expect it will be even better on Tuesday.
“Parkhead surpassed my expectations. As soon as Flower of Scotland started we realised the supporters were with us and that we had to deliver. Luckily, we did.
“My mum and some friends from down south were at the Ireland game. She drove back home on Friday night but she’ll be driving back up for the England match along with my brother.”
The self-belief of the hosts was boosted further on Friday when they handed the Republic of Ireland their first defeat of the qualifying campaign.
“We enjoyed the Ireland game,” Anya said. “We were all buzzing afterwards because it was a great three points. What can I say? It was hard-fought but we dug it out.
“A must-win game? It was and it wasn’t. There were still other matches to make up for it if we hadn’t won but we got the job done.
“It’s very important that we keep the momentum going against England. Winning is a habit and we need to keep it.
“We’ve been doing well at home, with two victories from two home games in this campaign. Now we want to keep on progressing and get a good result against England.”
The 1-0 victory over the Irish was merited but the match itself was a scrappy affair, with the visitors content to use foul play as a tactic to disrupt the Scots’ rhythm.
Anya, though, was pleased to prove that Scotland can cope with thyat approach. “We’re not the biggest team around and we try to play football but if other teams try to impose themselves on us then there’s no-one in our squad who won’t be up for that either.
“That’s part of the game and you need to be able to cope with the physical side and the mental side of it.
“Ireland played to their strengths. They have quite a few big lads and they tried to get the ball up there but we defended magnificently and, when we had possession, we were brave on the ball, which is what the gaffer wants.
“He’s given us the confidence to do that and he’s constantly shouting from the touchline: 'Get on the ball! Pass the ball!’ He’s been brilliant for us and instilled belief in everyone.”
