Conor McGregor destroys Dennis Siver to set up Las Vegas title showdown against Jose Aldo

Conor McGregor moved inexorably towards a UFC title showdown against Jose Aldo – most likely in Las Vegas on May 23 – after another scintillating performance of power, precision and preying on another opponent.
The Irishman, who many claimed had ‘talked’ his way to the top of the featherweight rankings, simply walked down the fifth victim of his UFC career.
Mystic Mac struck again in Boston, blowing away Dennis Siver with such ease that the legend of Conor McGregor grows ever more potent.
The mixed martial artist has the temperament, skillset and rabid following which has created the perfect storm, making him the most talked about star in the UFC at present. For the right reason.
Siver looked like a man from a lower division, hapless and driven by kicks and punches – and a long left hand that could not miss time and again – until the man from Ormsk’s mind and body could take no more just under two minutes into the second round.

It was merciful when referee Herb Dean rescued Siver from the mauling inflicted on him by McGregor, his face busted up and his will shattered.
McGregor had one thing on his mind when the fight was over – Jose Aldo, the featherweight champion, who was sitting Octagonside in Boston.
The Irishman was up over the Octagon wall, goading Aldo in his face, and having to be restrained by Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta’s minders, who were thankfully there to form a barrier.
McGregor then returned to the Octagon where he, with typical distaste yet underpinned with humour, told Aldo to take his (McGregor’s) spit bucket, go back to Brazil, and clean the belt for him.
This will be some build-up, some contest, between the Brazilian who has proven a brilliant featherweight champion in the WEC and now in the UFC. McGregor has grown into being a mental giant, and the title fight can but deliver one of the great UFC nights.
Elsewhere, the card was notable for two skewed judging decisions. Benson Henderson looked to have beaten Donald Cerrone in the co-main event, but ‘Cowboy’ took the judges’ decision 29-28 on all three cards.
Henderson landed against Cerrone by almost 2-1 in significant strikes and was 9 percent more accurate. It was close, but Henderson should have been given two of the rounds.
The night's heinous judging decision, nonetheless, came when Cathal Pendred was awarded his contest 30-27 (twice), and 29-28 over Sean Spencer. Pendred’s heart carried him through, but Spencer stiffened the Irishman’s legs in the opener and outstruck the Dubliner who returned to the city of his birth.
The result was received with universal derision. The word in use was ‘robbery’, comparisons being made with Ross Pearson’s loss on the cards to Diego Sanchez in New Mexico last year.
