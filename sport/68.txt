Burrows' 2 quick goals in 3rd lift Canucks over Flyers 4-1
VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A bit of extra rest did Alexandre Burrows a world of good.
The veteran forward scored a pair of goals 17 seconds apart in the third period, and the Vancouver Canucks beat the Philadelphia Flyers 4-1 on Tuesday night.
Burrows, who has been dealing with a groin injury, didn't play Saturday in Vancouver's victory over Toronto even though he was cleared medically to be in the lineup.
But with Zack Kassian out against the Flyers because of an undisclosed injury, Burrows took up a familiar role alongside Daniel and Henrik Sedin on the Canucks' top line.
He didn't disappoint.
Burrows snapped a 1-1 tie at 6:44. He ripped a shot between Steve Mason's pads after he took a feed from Daniel Sedin.
Fans barely had a chance to sit when Burrows scored his second of the night and 14th of the season off a rebound of Sedin's shot at 7:01.
''They play well together,'' Vancouver coach Willie Desjardins said. ''They've played together for a long time, and the chemistry is good. That was timely to get those two goals. They battled hard all night.
''You have to admire those guys.''
The goals were the first for Burrows in 11 games, dating to Feb. 7. He also missed seven other games due to the groin injury.
''It's been a long time, for sure. It was nice,'' said Burrows, who turns 34 next month. ''I wanted to make some plays and get some offense. Lucky enough the twins are great players and they were able to find some open space, find me in shooting areas.''
Desjardins said Burrows is an example of what added down time can do for a player at this point in the season.
''Burr took a little bit of time off, and it paid off today,'' he said. ''If we have guys banged up a little bit, and even if we don't, guys can use it to get the rest they need so they can come back fresher.
''It's really disappointing when you're not going to get to play, but I think if we use it right, it can help us down the stretch.''
Alexander Edler added a goal and an assist, and Radim Vrbata scored into an empty net for the Canucks, who moved three points ahead of Calgary for second place in the Pacific Division. Eddie Lack made 27 saves.
''I felt good out there,'' Lack said. ''We played good defensively, and it was just a good win for us.''
Michael Raffl had the lone goal for Philadelphia, and Mason stopped 31 shots.
''We're playing well, two plays and it's 3-1,'' Flyers coach Craig Berube said. ''Second goal, I'm sure (Mason) would like it back, but we find a way to lose the game rather than win it.''
Vrbata's goal was his team-leading 26th.
After a scoreless first period, the Flyers grabbed a 1-0 lead at 10:42 of the second when Raffl deflected a nice feed from captain Claude Giroux past Lack for his 17th goal.
Vancouver's Jannik Hansen rang a shot off the crossbar-post seam on a one timer earlier in the period, but the Canucks got on the board with 5:32 left.
Seconds after Lack made a big glove save on Nick Cousins at the other end, Derek Dorsett threw a puck in front of Mason that linemate Brad Richardson deftly directed with his skate to a pinching Edler, who scored his sixth of the season from the side of the net.
With the game being played on St. Patrick's Day, the Canucks honored former player, coach, general manager and team president Pat Quinn before the opening faceoff in an on-ice ceremony.
''The Pat Quinn ceremony definitely got us going,'' Lack said. ''It was a fun atmosphere today.''
The 71-year-old Quinn, who also coached the Flyers, died in November.
The game was delayed for about 15 minutes, but when it got going the teams traded chances, with the Flyers coming closest to scoring in the first period.
Philadelphia defenseman Carlo Colaiacovo hit the crossbar from the slot about six minutes in, and had another great chance from just about the same spot a bit later that Lack blocked with his chest protector.
NOTES: The City of Vancouver unveiled Pat Quinn Way - a renamed portion of a street that runs adjacent to Rogers Arena - about an hour before the game. ... Canucks forward Zack Kassian sat out because of an undisclosed injury. ... Vrbata's goal was his team-leading 26th.
