British number two James Ward has confirmed he will play at the new ATP World Tour event in Nottingham in June.
Ward's stunning five-set win over John Isner helped Great Britain to Davis Cup success against the United States last month and the 28-year-old is close to breaking into the top world's 100.
He played at the event when it was last held in Nottingham in 2008.
"I'm really looking forward to it. It's a great venue with fantastic grass courts that I know well," Ward said.
"British players are well supported when we play at home venues and the incredible atmosphere at the Davis Cup tie in Glasgow against the USA shows the passion that is out there for tennis in this country."
It was announced in December that the East Midlands venue will also stage a WTA tournament in from 8-14 June.
The men's event follows from June 22, the week before Wimbledon.
The Nottingham Open, a men's tournament held at the city's tennis centre, folded in 2008 after 14 years as a warm-up event for the sport's only Grand Slam to be played on grass.
