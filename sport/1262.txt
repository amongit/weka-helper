Australia's sporting image has been trashed by the latest revelations about its Olympic swimming team

What with the bombshell report of last week when the Australian crime commission reported a widespread drugs culture at two of the major football codes in the country, this latest report into what went wrong with the country's flagship Olympic sport has created a confusing maelstrom of its national identity.
For if there is one sport that exemplifies the Aussie spirit, it is swimming.
The Australian image is one of perfecting the art of lap after mindless lap, embracing the discipline of 4am starts, emerging from the water sleek, muscled, triumphant first – and then having the beer.
This is the one sport that Australia can match the pre-eminence of the Americans, can wallop the Brits and outdo the Europeans.
But there were signs on the first day of the London Olympics that all was not well.

The brash 100m world record holder, James ''the Missile'' Magnussen was pipped for a ''certain'' gold medal. The men's relay team failed to win its ''in the bag'' medal too.
The final swim team's Olympic haul of 10 medals was the worst result in two decades, well below the public's expectations.
And then the stories emerged of initiation ceremonies involving sleeping pills, waking team-mates at night, even the rather gross schoolboy act of putting shaved hair into team-mates bedding: all silly, juvenile and ultimately significant distractions.
The subsequent brutal review released today notes cases of swimmers “getting drunk, misuse of prescription drugs, breaching curfews, deceit, bullying”.
Buried in the report is a whinge at the London Olympic facilities, how there wasn't a common room for the swimmers to gather and create a harmonious team environment.
Quite rightly the nation's political and sporting leaders are now horrified that Australia's hard won sporting image is being so roundly trashed. Just how quickly this reputation can be rescued may well depend on both the Ashes and the Lions tour.
