Roy Hodgson likely to seek another two years as England manager

Roy Hodgson will attend the 2018 World Cup draw in St Petersburg on July 25, triggering inevitable debate about his long-term future. Hodgson’s deal as England manager expires after Euro 2016 and he is believed to be open to the idea of extending his contract to take in the World Cup in Russia.
Along with all national associations, the Football Association received a letter from Fifa on Thursday, inviting their national coach and senior executives to the draw at the Konstantinovsky Palace in St Petersburg. The FA confirmed that Hodgson will definitely attend, along with Michelle Farrer, England’s director of team operations.
Hodgson is enjoying the job, and has given no indication to people within the FA of wanting to retire after next year’s tournament in France. He has won 21, drawn 11 and lost five of his 37 internationals since being appointed as Fabio Capello’s successor on May 1, 2012.
The 67-year-old has spoken of his delight in how young players such as Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Nathaniel Clyne, and the slightly older likes of Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck and Jordan Henderson are developing, with the hope that they will reach their peak at the 2018 and particularly the 2022 World Cup finals.
His hopes of returning to Russia rest on the FA offering him a new contract. The governing body of English football will begin considering his future only when the new chief executive is appointed. Alex Horne’s successor will join the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, and the increasingly powerful technical director, Dan Ashworth, in deciding who is the most suitable candidate to lead England to Russia, whether that is Hodgson, or a younger coach such as Gareth Southgate.

They will also have to debate whether the manager should be English, British and “home-grown” like Brendan Rodgers, or whether they will look overseas.
Hodgson enjoys a good working relationship with his FA employers in Dyke and also with Ashworth, who appointed him head coach at West Bromwich Albion.

Dyke and Ashworth are also likely to travel to St Petersburg this summer with Hodgson and Farrer.
The FA will be cautious about rushing into contract negotiations. England reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 under Hodgson, but disappointed at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, being knocked out after only two games.
The criticism Hodgson received in Brazil was tempered by the surprisingly supportive reaction of England fans at the final game, the stalemate with Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte, when they stayed on to salute the players and the manager. Yet there are many who believe that Hodgson has not inspired the players.
But since the World Cup, England have strolled through an admittedly straightforward Euro 2016 qualifying group, winning their four ties against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia, scoring 11 times, conceding once, and leading Group E by six points. They have also won friendlies with Norway and Scotland.
England have undoubtedly revived since Brazil, but a bigger test of the potential of Hodgson’s young side will come in the Turin friendly against Italy on March 31. Hodgson announces his squad for that game, and the March 27 Wembley qualifier against Lithuania, on March 19.
If Hodgson is to win a two-year contract extension, much will depend on how England fare at the Euros [assuming no disaster befalls them and they fail to qualify]. Given the bloated nature of the competition
in France, with numbers increased from 16 to 24, England will expect to qualify from their group to the round of 16.
What should be the minimum achievement for a developing team is a moot point, but it would surely be unwise of the FA even to consider giving Hodgson a new contract in advance. Hodgson has to prove himself in France first.
The FA is mindful of past expensive mistakes. On the eve of the 2010 World Cup, it awarded Capello a lucrative amended contract, removing a break clause, partly to see off interest from Inter Milan. Although there were calls for Capello to be sacked after a poor World Cup in South Africa, the FA stayed loyal, also knowing it would have to pay him off.
At the previous World Cup, Germany 2006, the long contract enjoyed by Sven-Goran Eriksson as England manager proved costly to terminate [with negotiations taking place before the tournament].
England’s friendly with the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Sunday June 7 will be a 1pm kick-off. This will be England’s first visit to Dublin since their fans rioted at Lansdowne Road in 1995, forcing the abandonment of the friendly, and the early kick-off reflects a desire to limit pre-match drinking.
Following discussions with the Football Association of Ireland and the Garda, the FA has been allocated 3,000 tickets for England’s penultimate game of the season. England have been allocated 1,846 tickets for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia in the Stozice Stadium, Ljubljana, on June 14.
