Pakistan bowler Mohammad Irfan has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup with a stress fracture of the pelvis.
Irfan, 32, missed Pakistan's final group match, the win over Ireland in Adelaide on Sunday, with the injury.
The 7ft 1in pace bowler took eight wickets in his five 2015 World Cup matches, with best figures of 4-30 against Zimbabwe.
Pakistan may consider calling up a replacement after Friday's quarter-final against Australia in Adelaide.
Junaid Khan, who dropped out of Pakistan's initial 15-man squad before the World Cup with a hamstring injury, could replace Irfan after declaring himself "100% fit" ahead of a club match in Abbottabad on Sunday.
Irfan underwent an MRI scan on Monday that showed a stress injury, but a more detailed scan on Tuesday highlighted a stress fracture.
