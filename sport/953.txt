Gustav Larsson has announced that he will become the latest rider to make an attempt at the hour record when the Swede tackles Rohan Dennis's mark of 52.491km at the Manchester Velodrome on Saturday afternoon.
Larsson, an accomplished time trialist who finished second in the discipline at the Beijing Olympics, 2009 world championships and the 2013 edition of the Chrono des Nations, will make his attempt at the afternoon session of the sixth and final round of the Revolution Series.
The Cult Energy rider will become the sixth male rider to make an attempt at the hour record since the International Cycling Union (UCI) revised the rules regarding the event in June 2014.
Jens Voigt, in Sept 2014, set a new mark of 51.115km at the Velodrome Suisse in Grenchen before Matthias Brändle, the following month, managed to ride a further 737m.
Jack Bobridge, though, fell short of the mark last month after riding 52.491km before Dennis set the current record, again in Grenchen. A further attempt by Thomas Dekker failed to break Dennis's record and Larsson has said that "it will not be easy".
“I am very confident of breaking the Swedish hour record but it is the world record I am after” he said in a statement. “I think it will be possible – it will not be easy but I am feeling ready for the challenge.”
“I was inspired to try for the hour record when I was trying to heal my broken back last year. It was one of the goals to get back on the bike and to look forward to through the rehab and winter training.”
“When I heard about the [aborted Alex] Dowsett and [Dame Sarah] Storey attempts at the Revolution Series meet at London I thought it was a super concept. It looked like the perfect venue to do my attempt at the last round and on the historically fast track in Manchester so we contacted the organisers”.
After hosting Dame Sarah Storey's failed attempt at the women's hour last month, promoter James Pope is now ready to host the first men's endeavour the Revolution Series after Dowsett's planned endeavour was cancelled after the Movistar rider suffered a broken collarbone during training.
“We're pleased to be hosting another UCI hour record attempt in the UK and look forward to welcoming Gustav to Manchester,” said Pope.
“The atmosphere and excitement we experienced during Dame Sarah Storey's attempt was phenomenal so we know the event will make a great addition to the Revolution race programme.”
