Exeter will resist the temptation to draft in Premiership regulars for the LV= Cup final against Saracens.
The Chiefs made 14 changes for the semi-final win at Leicester, with Adam Hughes, Ceri Sweeney and Jerry Sexton among those making rare starts.
"I think we're going to keep with the core of that squad, I think they deserve it," coach Ricky Pellow said.
"You can't fault the effort they've put in, not just today, but in previous games," he told BBC Radio Devon.
The final will be staged at Northampton on Sunday and Exeter are bidding to become the first team to retain the LV= Cup.
They beat Northampton 12 months ago to lift the first major trophy in the club's history.
But the Chiefs will face a Saracens side who beat them 35-18 in their final group match last month.
"Saracens next week is going to be a forward-orientated battle again, based around kicking and territory," Pellow added.
"If we can get the ball in Fetu'u's (Vainikolo) hands and Tom James' hands we've got some really dangerous players there.
"That'll be the challenge next week, to bring those guys into the game. It shows where we are as a squad now, that we can rotate the squad and still be competitive."
