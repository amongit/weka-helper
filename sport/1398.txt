Bhutan, the lowest ranked side in the world, have defied the odds and progressed to the next round of World Cup qualifying by beating Sri Lanka.
Fifa's 209th-ranked nation secured a 3-1 aggregate victory by winning the second leg of their Asian preliminary first-round tie 2-1 in Thimphu.
It comes four days after their shock 1-0 win in the first leg in Colombo.
Chencho Gyeltshen scored both goals for the home side, who completed only their fifth-ever competitive win.
Gyeltshen, nicknamed "The Ronaldo of Bhutan", ensured his side move a step closer to the finals in Russia in 2018.
The 19-year-old opened the scoring on five minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates when he coolly struck the winner in the 90th-minute, sealing Bhutan's progression against a team 36 places higher in the rankings.
Bhutan, a tiny Himalayan kingdom, will now take their place in the group stage, involving 40 Asian teams.
They will be joined by East Timor , ranked 185th, who beat Mongolia (195th) 5-1 on aggregate.
India (173rd), managed by Englishman Stephen Constantine, progressed after a 0-0 draw with Nepal (180th) in Kathmandu, which followed a 2-0 first leg victory in Guwahati.
Pakistan's (170th) home leg against Yemen (175th) in Lahore was postponed and shifted to an unconfirmed neutral venue after a Taliban attack on churches in the city.
Cambodia (181st) progressed 4-1 on aggregate against Macau (187th) while Chinese Taipei (188th) overturned a 1-0 first leg deficit with a 2-0 win against Brunei (198th).
