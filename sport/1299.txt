Tottenham 1 Fiorentina 1, match report: Mauricio Pochettino may regret decision to bench Harry Kane

Not even Harry Kane could provide any rays of sunshine for Tottenham Hotspur here, on a damp and rainy night at White Hart Lane.
Spurs will head to Florence for the second leg next week battling to save their Europa League campaign after a deeply frustrating experience against the Viola, in which Mauricio Pochettino may regret his decision to bench Kane.
This time last year Pochettino was talking of this competition with similar levels of disdain reserved for a trip to the dentists, suggesting it was the equivalent of the wooden spoon after months of hard work.
And his team selection certainly suggested that Spurs’s route towards a possible Champions League place will have to be achieved in a different competition, as Fiorentina secured a deserved draw.
Kane was dropped to the bench despite five goals in his last three games and could not inspire his team after his introduction 24 minutes from the end.

Roberto Soldado’s excellent volley had given Spurs the type of start which suggested another routine victory against Italian opposition but Fiorentina’s away goal, a close-range finish from Jose Maria Basanta, may prove crucial in Thursday’s second leg.
With Spurs’s Capital One Cup Final against Chelsea less than 72 hours later, it could be another interesting team selection from Pochettino.
“We have six games in 17 days and potentially it’s difficult so we need to rotate and give the opportunity for all to play,” he said.
“It’s a shame because my feeling is a little bit disappointed with the result because we deserved more, but I am happy with the performance.
“We need to be focussed on the next game and try not to think too much about the fixture. But we have to go to Florence, we have 90 minutes to try and win the game to try to go to the next round.”
This was the first game in a crucial fortnight. This Sunday Spurs face West Ham United in the Premier League, before the return leg in Florence and the Wembley showpiece against Chelsea.
With those potentially pivotal games on the horizon, it was perhaps no surprise Pochettino dropped man-of-the-moment Harry Kane to the bench, despite the forward’s five goals in Europe already this season, though it gave an indication of the club’s priorities.
Any fears over Kane’s exclusion looked to have been swiftly dispelled. It took his replacement, Soldado, only seven minutes to seize his chance, with his spectacular volley rewarding a fierce start from the home team.
Fiorentina goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu had saved brilliantly to deny Nacer Chadli barely 30 seconds earlier but got nowhere near Soldado’s crisp strike, from Paulinho’s corner.
It was the £26 million forward’s first goal since mid-December.
Andros Townsend is another player to have experienced limited opportunities this season but was inspired in the first half. He was constantly in motion on the right wing, attacking Fiorentina’s Manuel Pasqual and displaying the full repertoire of tricks.
With Spurs dominant, Christian Eriksen drove over the crossbar and Soldado almost delivered an equally outstanding effort but his scissor kick dropped straight into the arms of Tatarusanu.
Fiorentina, fourth in Serie A and backed by a noisy following, were intent on catching Spurs on the counter-attack but struggling to get out their own half.
Townsend produced another devastating break on the right, bypassing two defenders to advance into the penalty area before his shot was deflected for a corner.
But out of nowhere came an equaliser nine minutes before half-time. Matias Fernandez’s free kick was pushed out by Hugo Llloris at the near post but the ball bounced off Stefan Savic’s back and presented Basanta with a simple finish.
Pochettino stood motionless in his technical area, surely fearing it could prove such a costly goal to concede. He was also stunned on the stroke of half-time when Fiorentina benefited from another huge slice of fortune.
Soldado’s header forced a superb save from Tatarusanu but Chadli could only slice the rebound onto the crossbar, before Fiorentina hastily cleared.
That astonishing miss clearly lifted Fiorentina, for they were more in control in the second half. Mohamed Salah, the winger signed on loan from Chelsea, gave Lloris an early warning with a sidefooted effort that drifted narrowly of the post.
Chilean midfielder David Pizarro gradually grew more influential, effortlessly dictating the game in front of the defensive back three.
Spurs did threaten, with Soldado failing to capitalise on sublime crosses from Ben Davies and Chadli into the area, which only hastened the introduction of Kane from the bench.
Those ‘he’s one of our own’ chants had been audible for the last ten minutes and he appeared in the 65th minute, instantly producing a buzz around the old stadium, but Spurs looked tired by the end.
Kane was struggling to make an impact and one poor pass to Eriksen summed up a frustrating night for Spurs. Advantage Fiorentina.
Vincenzo Montella, the Viola manager, said: “In the first 30 minutes we suffered but they paid the price for their high energy.
“Ultimately it was a fair result and the return game will be open. I’d like to congratulate my players.”
