Dirk Nowitzki Joins Avett Brothers: Mavericks Star Plays Tambourine During Concert (VIDEO)
Dirk Nowitzki seems to have a lot of time on his hands since the Oklahoma City Thunder swept his Mavericks in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs. Apparently, the former MVP isn't sitting around moping. He is even exploring his musical talents, and luckily for everyone, it doesn't involve his singing voice.
During a recent concert, the Maverick made a surprise cameo with the banjo-wielding indie rock band, The Avett Brothers. At 7-feet tall, Nowitzki towered over band members on stage as he feverishly rocked out on a tambourine to the group's song, "I Killed Sally's Lover". Bassist Joe Kwon later sent out multiple tweets expressing his excitement over the collaboration.
With Nowitzki stuck watching the NBA Finals this season rather than starring in them, Kwon could possibly convince him to go on the road with the band if they need more tambourine.
