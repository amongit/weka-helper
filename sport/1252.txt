Wayne Rooney scored a superb solo goal, and produced just as good a celebration, as Manchester United convincingly beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to open up a six-point gap between the teams in the race for Champions League qualification.

After dribbling his way through Tottenham's fragile defense to score United's third goal in the 34th minute, Rooney celebrated by shaping a series of boxing punches before falling over on his back.
Rooney was making fun of a video, released by a British newspaper on Sunday, that appeared to show him being floored by a punch by former United teammate Phil Bardsley in a sparring session in his kitchen.

Goals by Marouane Fellaini and Michael Carrick put United 2-0 ahead after 19 minutes at Old Trafford in arguably United's best performance of the season, albeit against a Spurs team that capitulated in the first half - mirroring many of its displays against top sides last season.
They were thought to be a thing of the past but they resurfaced at Old Trafford, with even in-form striker Harry Kane having a quiet game. He was well shackled by Chris Smalling throughout.

United stayed fourth, a point behind Arsenal and two behind second-place Manchester City.
