Louis van Gaal has been accused of disrespecting senior figures at Manchester United in a withering attack on his managerial regime.
Former Holland international Wim van Hanegem launched an extraordinary tirade at his fellow countryman, claiming he has mistreated his assistant manager Ryan Giggs, mishandled Radamel Falcao and ruined Angel di Maria's confidence.
United face Tottenham on Sunday in a match that will go a long way to deciding whether they finish in the top four - their only remaining target this season after they were bundled out of the FA Cup by Arsenal.
• Why Spurs are glad they chose Pochettino over Van Gaal
Scrutiny has been growing on Van Gaal's methods, with Paul Scholes criticising his tactics in a recent newspaper column. And this latest attack by one of Dutch football's most respected figures - Van Hanegem was a member of the side that finished runners-up at the 1974 World Cup - will only add to the pressure.

Flashpoint: Louis Van Gaal's strange confrontation with Ryan Giggs at Newcastle sparked suggestions of a rift
Giggs' stony-faced reaction to Van Gaal celebrating a late winning goal at Newcastle recently sparked suggestions that the pair had fallen out, although Van Gaal later denied they had a bad relationship. But Van Hanegem believes the manager is not showing enough respect to one of United's greatest ever players.
Van Hanegem is quoted by The Mirror as saying: “What I hate to see is how Van Gaal is treating Ryan Giggs. Louis has more attention for the other geezer next to him. But Louis forgets that we are talking here about Ryan Giggs.
“Louis has played for Telstar, FC Antwerp and Sparta Rotterdam. Giggs was a giant as a player. He deserves more respect than this."
Disrespected? Van Gaal has treated Falcao "like a fourth division striker"
Van Hanegem then turned his attention to Van Gaal's relationship with Falcao, who was recently asked to play with the club's under-21 squad and is almost certainly not going to be kept on beyond this summer.
He said: “Falcao has proven over the past few years that he is one of the best strikers in the world. But at United he is being treated as if he was signed from an old fourth division club.

“Sometimes he’s allowed to play a few minutes, sometimes he is allowed to start, other times he sits 90 minutes on the bench, or even worse, in the stands.
“I can see there are more players not happy at United. Di Maria was one of the most important links in the chain at Real Madrid. In the World Cup he was the best player in the Argentina side. But at United he hasn’t been able to pass a ball over more than 25 yards most times.”
