Fernando Alonso will return to McLaren’s factory in Woking this week to drive their simulator to see if he is able to return to Formula One.

The Spaniard’s accident and condition has provoked a swirl of speculation ever since he hit a wall at the Circuit de Catalunya in pre-season testing on February 22. Alonso, who re-signed for McLaren for 2015 on $40 million (£27 million) a year, was concussed and forced to miss the first race of the season in Australia. The uncertainty surrounding the cause of his accident – and his subsequent three-day hospital stay – has led many to suggest that he may be suffering from an unknown illness.
McLaren’s simulator is able to recreate the bumps and undulations of the track but not the searing heat. The two-time champion has posted several photographs and videos on social media of his training regime as he prepares for his comeback.

Asked whether Alonso would conduct a track test before Malaysia, a McLaren spokesman confirmed to Telegraph Sport the Spaniard’s simulator programme but said the rest of his preparation was confidential.
It is understood that Alonso, 33, also plans to undertake the FIA’s medical test which he must pass to be declared fit to race in Kuala Lumpur. The test is known as the ‘FIA impact test’, and measures a driver’s ability to perform a number of physical and mental exercises by using a computer programme. It lasts around 45 minutes and to pass Alonso will have to match – or come very close to – a personal benchmark set on several occasions in the past.
This test, usually conducted once every one or two years, is normally done at the circuit on the Thursday before a race. In this case, that will be March 26 in Kuala Lumpur. However, given there would be little point in Alonso travelling to Malaysia unless he had already been passed fit to race, it is thought it will be done before then, somewhere in Europe.

Alonso is said to be concerned by the unexplained nature of the crash, and his subsequent memory loss, but he was in contact with the team in Australia over the weekend from his home in Dubai.
