Trump feeling increasingly comfortable in front of the cameras
Judd Trump reveals he is feeling increasingly "confident and comfortable in front of the cameras" following his 6-3 quarter-final victory over Stephen Maguire at the UK Championships in York.
The Bristolian believes he still has improvements to make on his game however, saying his "safety hasn't been great" and he is "giving too many chances away".
But Trump also adds that he thinks practising less has actually helped improve his game.
