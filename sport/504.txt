Lindsay Lohan has poked fun at her reckless reputation behind the wheel in a new advert for car insurance.
The troubled actress, who is working hard to reform her reputation as a wildchild, stars in the esurance commercial which premiered during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday night.
"So you may have heard something about me being in an #ad for Esurance ... well, it’s #sorta true ...," she teased fans on her Facebook and Twitter pages before the commercial aired.
The advert sees Lohan swerving all over the road in a bashed-up car, as two young boys watch, astonished.
One boy mistakes Lohan for the other's mother, which his friend swiftly denies.

"Hey, I'm sorta your mom," Lohan explains. "We're both 25-35 years old, we're both women on the go, and we've both clocked a lot of miles, believe me.
"Whatever, I'm outta here," she continues as police sirens can be heard in the background.

The advert promotes individually tailored insurance coverage, which – the brand insists – doesn't generalise about its customers.
"Sorta you isn't you," the tag-line reads.
Companies paid up to a record $4.5 million for 30 seconds during the game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.
The match was watched by an estimated 100 million-plus viewers – the year's biggest television audience.
