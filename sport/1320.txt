Ian Poulter's 'inexcusable' error keeps alive race to become top European golfer

Ian Poulter was furious at an “inexcusable” error as he squandered a six-shot halfway lead in the Turkish Airlines Open and inadvertently kept alive the battle to be crowned European No 1.
Seeking his first win for two years, Poulter completed a second round of 66 when the weather-affected event resumed on Saturday morning, taking his total for his last six rounds at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal to 33 under par.
However, the 38-year-old then struggled to a third round of 75 to end the day one shot behind Australian Wade Ormsby, who shot a 68 to finish 12 under par.
Lee Westwood carded a 67 to finish alongside his Ryder Cup team-mate Poulter and Germany’s Marcel Siem on 11 under, Siem’s 66 reviving his bid to prevent Rory McIlroy winning the Race to Dubai for the second time in three years.
Siem has to win in Turkey and at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai to have any chance of overtaking the world No 1 McIlroy at the top of the money list.

“It’s brought obviously a lot of players back into the fray,” Poulter said. “Their dinner is going to taste lovely tonight and mine is going to taste horrible.”
A three-putt bogey at the first was cancelled out by a birdie on the fourth, but Poulter then bogeyed the fifth and 11th before running up a double bogey on the 15th after his approach clattered into a tree short of the green.
“I’m most angry about the wedge shot which led to a double,” the world No 40 said. “That’s inexcusable for me to make that error right there.
“A simple wedge shot puts me to 20 feet with an outside birdie look at worst, and I hit the tree, so I’m going to be angry about that for a little while tonight and then I’ll be fine tomorrow.
"I’m going to get my head down and do the job tomorrow. Today was really disappointing to be out of rhythm after playing such great golf.”
Westwood had been eight shots behind Poulter after the second round but was aided by holing his second shot to the seventh for an eagle as he charged up the leaderboard.
“It’s been a while since I’ve been in contention, but generally when I get in contention, I know what to do,” Westwood, who won the Malaysian Open in April, said.
Siem, Jamie Donaldson and Sergio Garcia began the week as the only men who could catch McIlroy in the Race to Dubai and although Garcia carded a superb 65 to move to five under, the BMW Masters winner Siem has the best chance to keep the battle going to the final week.
“It’s a little bit more interesting now for everybody and for sure I’ll give it a shot tomorrow, try my best. That’s what we are out here for, and there’s why it’s called Race to Dubai,” Siem said.
“I’ll have a good rest now and hope that my ball-striking is as good as today and the putter is hot. Can’t wait to go.”
