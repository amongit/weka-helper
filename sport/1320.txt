Midfielder Thompson limped out of Tuesday night`s 2-1 Johnstone`s Paint Trophy Southern Area Final defeat against Brentford after being on the end of a heavy tackle and is a doubt.
Defender Tully has been struggling with a niggling knee injury and, despite returning to light training, is also struggling.
Experienced striker Jamie Cureton should continue up front following his midweek comeback from a hamstring injury and is likely to be supported by Daniel Nardiello after his fourth goal in five games against the Bees.
John O`Flynn and Richard Logan will fight it out for the other supporting role in attack if Tisdale uses the 4-3-3 formation.
The Grecians are looking to end a run of three consecutive defeats in all competitions.
