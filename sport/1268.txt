Andy Hunt ends four-year tenure at British Olympic Association as Seb Coe praises 'tireless efforts'

His resignation comes just weeks after the BOA parted company with chief commercial officer Hugh Chambers amid growing pressure on its finances following the failure to sign any new sponsorship deals since the London Olympics.
Hunt, who was appointed by former chairman Lord Moynihan in 2008 and was Team GB chef de mission at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 and at the London Games, told the BOA’s board of directors of his decision at its meeting on Wednesday.
The BOA, which is undergoing a cost-cutting rationalisation under Coe’s leadership, said it would not be seeking a replacement until after it had completed a strategic review of its operations in April. It will not be making an interim appointment and a management team will now report directly to Coe.
Hunt said: “I will always be proud to have led Team GB at a home Games and of the fantastic performance of the team this summer and the way in which the BOA supported the athletes.
"Now that the Games are over and the organisation’s strategy for the next four years is taking shape, the BOA’s responsibilities and the job of the chief executive are different and I feel it is the right time for me to move on to another leadership role with breadth and profile similar to the responsibilities I’ve fulfilled since 2008.”

As chef de mission in London, Hunt oversaw Britain’s most successful Olympics in more than a century with 65 medals, including 29 gold, though achievements in the sporting arena were not always matched by the BOA’s commercial performance off it.
Its decision to utilise its two exclusive merchandising opportunities at the Olympics by selling branded head scarves and commemorative medallions backfired badly, with huge quantities of unsold stock.
Coe, who is expected to take on a more hands-on role, paid tribute to Hunt’s contribution to the success of Britain’s athletes.
“Team GB had the very best facilities, care and preparation at the London 2012 Games thanks to the tireless efforts and passion of Andy Hunt and his team over the last four years,” Coe said.
Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee announced on Wednesday that Glasgow was one of three shortlisted candidates to host the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, along with Buenos Aires and the Colombian city Medellin. The final decision will be made in April.
