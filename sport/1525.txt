Former Great Britain head coach Brian Noble has revealed he is in talks with London Broncos about joining the Championship club's coaching team.
Joey Grima stepped down as head coach of the former Super League club for family reasons on 2 March.
Noble said he is hopeful of working with caretaker coach Andrew Henderson.
He told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "There's an element of truth in the rumour. It's not done yet but I'm hoping it can be done."
Noble added: "I'm a big fan of Andrew Henderson. We've worked together and I like his talent as a coach.
"I think he should be the coach but if he needs my assistance in some way, I think it would be something I could probably do.
"We're clearly not over the line but we're in discussions."
London Broncos, who were relegated from Super League last season, are eighth in the Championship after two wins and two defeats in their first four matches.
"I've always been a fan and an advocate of rugby league in the capital but there are challenges that come with that so it would be interesting to have a closer view of it and see what could be done," Noble said.
