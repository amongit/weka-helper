Burnley strike at heart of Manchester City's problems

The Manchester City fans can see it. Burnley manager Sean Dyche saw it. Anyone watching the soon-to-be-deposed champions has been seeing it for months. George Boyd, Saturday’s matchwinner, revealed how the home players had spent several days analysing it.
“They don’t track back as well as they go forward and we knew we could exploit that,” said Boyd. “They are world-class players but if you press them hard they don’t like it.”
Luis Enrique will have spotted it, too, the Barcelona scouts dispatched to Turf Moor having to do no more than cut and paste their reports from earlier trips.
The concern for the City board is why does Manuel Pellegrini not see it? If he can, why does he seem incapable of doing anything about it?
If the Chilean’s team sheet at the Nou Camp does not contain extra legs in midfield to compensate for those who do not bother to use theirs, the City hierarchy will be doing so much head-shaking before a ball is kicked they will need treatment for repetitive stress injury.
After the defeats to Barcelona and Liverpool this should have been the day we saw fire in the bellies and pride in City’s performance. Instead, the energy setting was on eco-friendly, and the heat maps would barely cover a postage stamp. All the application came from those in claret and blue.
Contrast Dyche’s and Pellegrini’s intuition. The Burnley manager played 4-4-2, pairing Sam Vokes and Danny Ings to induce panic in the City defence, calculating he would never be outnumbered against a midfield that considers closing down optional.

Burnley looked organised and well coached, City ramshackle; out-run, out-thought and out-played for the second consecutive away game.
Whatever the system, the manager cannot be held entirely responsible if his players decide not to run.
Here is what Manchester City now resemble: a squad of high-class individuals who are self-motivated - performing when the mood takes them - who see the manager as an extra in their movie rather than the director.
At their best they are like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull - dedicated, professional and masters of their craft.
At their worst, they are more like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now - bloated, overpaid and barely able to summon the energy to emerge from their trailer.
City’s players make or break the manager at their whim, and look like they are playing for change. They got rid of Roberto Mancini, his leading them to the title 12 months earlier of no consequence as their gripes caught the attention of the boardroom. He did not flatter their egos enough and departed amid a call to repair a fractured dressing room.
Now they will probably see off Pellegrini because he has lost the ability or desire to pamper. Pellegrini has earned most credit over the last 18 months for being a decent chap who brought serenity to the training ground rather than a strategic genius, but Saturday felt like the beginning of the end of a cycle. The risk for the senior players is they might be perceived as the problem rather than the best means of finding a solution. We will know more about the club’s attitude if they tell their baker to circle the date of Yaya Touré’s birthday.
Pellegrini does not seem to possess the whip of a disciplinarian, although how you disarm a group of guns for hire is a longer-term problem. While those around them work diligently to create an identity for the club, at times like this the players look as though they’re there for the cheque.
That is why it is fundamental City start to produce Academy players. For all the talent they have recruited there is an absence of heart and soul.

It is too easy to call this a crisis. They are always going to be a couple of wins and one transfer window away from restoring calm.
They may turn up at the Nou Camp, and Pellegrini might finally give the impression he has been working on a masterplan to alter the shape.
Yet there is an inescapable feeling change is back in the air, Pellegrini needing to prove he can oversee it. His pre-match plea for a new contract, and post-match assessment this was a 'normal’ performance gave the impression it was scripted by Richard Curtis as part of the Comic Relief fundraising effort.
“The only thing I can tell you is that it’s not down to the effort of the players,” he said. If Pellegrini continues to be blind to it, City will find an alternative with a clearer vision.
