UK Snooker Championship: I just trusted my game - Ricky Walden
Ricky Walden talks to Hazel Irvine, John Parrott and Ken Doherty following his 6-3 victory over Welshman Mark Williams in the UK Snooker Championship.
Particularly pleased to get a high profile scalp in front of the cameras, Walden put his run of good form down to working harder and cutting back on drinking.
He will now play Shaun Murphy in the quarter-finals.
