Commonwealth Games day six: as it happened
By Evan Fanning, and Rob Bagchi
10:00PM BST 29 Jul 2014
• Full schedule • Commonwealth Games 2014: medal table • 'Scottie dogs are disrespectful to Muslims' • Nigerian 16-year-old weightlifter fails drugs test • Jamaica's 100m champion Bailey-Cole slams Scottish food • Osagie disqualified after clash with Thomas • Defending champion Turner crashes out of 110m hurdles
What are you most looking forward to from today's action? What's the most enjoyable Commonwealth Games sport you've ever tried? Send all your thoughts and such to

22.00 That's it for the liveblog coverage for day six. Thanks for your company. We'll be back here at 9am in the morning. Good night. I will leave you with another of Gareth A Davies's sights of Glasgow 2014.

21.57 Laura Weightman is coached by Steve Cram who is understandably delighted.
21.56 Kenya's Faith Kibiegon wins gold, Laura Weightman silver for England and Van Buskirk bronze for Canada.
21.56 Kibiegon sprints down the back straight from Obiri lewading Muir and Weightman.
21.55 Laura Weightman hits the front after 900m but Obiri responds.
21.54 Slow, tactical start for the first 700m, the three Kenyans at the front.
21.52 Hannah England runs for ... Laura Muir for Scotland. A Weegie hersel'. Jemma Simpson also runs for England as does the Briish champion Laura Weightman. Kenya's Hellen Obiri is the fave rave.
21.49 The last track event of the night is the women's 1500m final, which will start in one minute.
21.45 It's that time of the evening, says Gareth A Davies.

21.40 Earlier, in the decathlon, England's Ashley Bryant ran a terrific 1500m to take silver. Sprinting to finish third and leaving Grenada's Kurt Felix trailing in sixth let him overtake his rival in the last event to become runner-up to Jamaica's Damian Warner.
21.35 Chris Walker-Hebborn, Adam Barrett and Adam Peaty of England celebrate winning the gold medal in the Men's 4 x 100m medley relay final.

21.22 England win! In Commonwealth Games record time! Amazing. Australia take silver, South Africa bronze. Adam Brown needed a lead to hold off James Magnussen, the fastest 100m free swimmer in the world this year. England gave it to him and he defended it. Marvellous.
21.20 Adam Barrett is powering away in the fly for England to give Adam Brown 2.03sec to defend.
21.20 Peaty keeps the lead after the breastroke from Australia but his lead is 1.24. Will that be enough?
21.19 England lead after the backstroke by 0.19 from Australia and NZ.
21.17 The last race of the gala is the men's 4x100m medley relay.
21.15 Wales and Northern Ireland have been disqualified for rather too rapid changeovers.
21.14 Australia win. England silver, Canada bronze. Wales fourth and Scotland fifth. The England team match the GB record time. Fran Halsall just cannot hold on as Kate Campbell, the quickest 100m fly swimmer in the world, outpaced her.
21.13 Siobhan Marie O'Connor on the fly went out fast and holds England's lead by 0.10 from Australia.
21.12 Sophie Taylor's awesome breastroke brings England back into contention. England lead from Australia and Canada.
21.10 Australia from Wales and Canada after the backstroke.
21.09 Back to the pool for the women's 4x100m medley relay.
21.07 Gareth A Davies has snapped Scotland's light weleter fighter Josh Taylor for your delight.

21.03 In the pool Canada's Ryan Cochrane defended his men's 1500m free title, Mack Horton of Australia claimed silver and Daniel Jervis of Wales won in a personal best of 14:55.33, 11 seconds quicker than his previous PB. Daniel is an apprentice painter and decorator. Like Supersonic Syd Little and Frank McLintock before him, he is a 'brother of the brush'.
20.59 Here are Kenya's metal collectors.

20.52 Correction - it was Shane Brathwaite not Ryan who took bronze for Barbados. The unrelated Brathwaites.
20.49 Will Sharman was leading until he hit hurdle eight with his trailing leg and lost his momentum. That's his second successive Commonwealth silver.
20.47 Andrew Riley wins for Jamaica Will Sharman second for England, Shane Brathwaite third for Barbados.
20.45 Now we're building up to the men's high hurdles. No Andy Turner, the defending champion, who hit the third barrier in his heat thsi morning and has been sounding understandably distraught ever since.
20.42 More from Gareth ...
Boxing: Men's Light Welter (64kg) Quarter-Final 2: Josh Taylor (Sco) bt Zack Davies (Wal) 3-0
Back in the boxing hall a punch perfect, dominant display by Josh Taylor over Zack Davies. Beautiful brutality. Taylor is heading towards gold in my book, having looked a potential Olympic medallist even before London 2012.
20.40 Amantle Montsho in lane six went like the clappers and ran herself to a standstill, going backwards after leading at 300m and ending in fourth.
20.36 Stephanie-Anne Mcpherson wins and it's a 1-2-3 for Jamaica. Novlene Williams-Mills takes silver and Christine Day bronze.
20.35 The women's 400m final begins.
20.30 Gareth A Davies is doing sterling work for the rolling blog. Thanks, Gareth.
Just caught up with Baroness Tanni a Grey-Thompson. Been covering her career since 1993, since she was Tanni Grey. The winner of 11 Paralympic gold medals on the track answers the question most people are asking about Parasport events at these Glasgow Comm Games. Why such a narrow programme of events? No Jonnie Peacock, Hannah Cockroft and so on.
"I would like more events. But I think what they've done is pick events that are very elite at the top end and then developmental. For most events it's quite hard to get the medals.
"But It's still an amazing platform with huge publicity and people don't differentiate. I think it also just reminds people that Rio is on its way. The Europeans are going to be really good. For a lot of sports the Europeans are a lot stronger than the Commonwealth."
Those IPC European Athletic Champs take place in Swansea in two weeks time. The Baroness has seen it all, from exhibition events wheelchair sprinting to bring involved when Paralympic sports were included in the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 2002 in Manchester.

20.24 Big shock in the third men's 400m semi-final where Lalonde Gordon wins, followed by Latoy Williams and Isaac Makwala misses out on the final, as does England's Nigel Levine.
20.20 Here's our own Gareth A Davies with Scotland's para-sport powerlifter Micky Yule. This inspirational athlete was a staff sergeant serving with the Royal Engineers in 2010, whe he lost both legs after stepping on an IED. Gareth urges you to follow him on the Twitter

20.15 Olympic champion Kirani James wins the second semi in 45.15.
20.10 Martyn Rooney eases to victory in his 400m semi-final. He won bronze at the European Championships in 2010 and looks back to his best. He's sporting a fairly bushy beard which, when paired with his sunglasses, makes him look like Catterick's Chris Palmer.

20.00 England's Laura Samuel shattered her personal best to win a shock silver medal in the triple jump. The 23-year-old, who was unknown to all bar hardened athletics fans going into Glasgow 2014, launched herself out to 14.09 metres. The distance was 34 centimetres greater than her previous best and more than half a metre further than she had jumped this year. It also sent the Leicester athlete up to third on the British all-time list. Jamaica's Kimberly Williams won gold by 12cm.

19.51 Tranter ahead of Wallace and Pavone after the breastroke.
19.51 Le Clos still ahead after the backstroke, beating Rousseau.
19.50 Le Clos beasts the fly leg. He's 1.14sec ahead.
19.48 Dan Wallace comes out for the men's 200m IM in a kilt. The crowd gans wild.

19.42 In Hampden Park we're coming to the conclusion of the women's 10,000m, a lap to go and three Kenyan athletes are 100m ahead of the field, Kiplagat leading at the bell.
19.40 England's women gymnasts receive their gold medals (left to right) Hannah Whelan, Ruby Harold, Rebecca Downie, Kelly Simm and Claudia Fragapane

19.34 Georgia Davies wins for Wales, Lauren Quigley takes silver for England!. Wales's second gold in the pool from a woman! Wow. She won in 27.56 a national record. Canada's Brooklynn Snodgrass was third.
19.32 It's time for the women's 50m backstroke.
19.29 Intermission

19.19 Ben Proud wins the sprint freestyle for England, winning the double! Cameron McEvoy and James Magnusson of Australia take the silver and bronze.

19.11 After 200m Lauren Boyle leads by .05 from Jazz Carlin who is .15sec ahead of Brittany (Bitty) Maclean.
19.10 Miley, as in yesterday's 800m free, goes out quick.
19.08 We're getting ready for the women's 400m freestyle. Remy Fairweather is in lane five and Lauren Boyle of NZ in lane four. Hannah Miley is in lane two. Jazz Carlin in seven.
19.04 Back to BBC1. The prestige channel. It would be demeaning to the event, the viewer and the royal family to keep it on BBC2? Anyway, rant over about BBC's pathetic view of what should be on which channel (no one cares as long as you show it on one or two). Gary Lineker is presenting dressed, acccording to his Tottenham tastes, as Chas Hodges out of Chas 'n' Dave. Or is he Alfred Dolittle?

19.00 It's the last night of the swimming gala and at last we have a sport that's easily comprehensible to the layperson. here's what we've got with Jazz Carlin and Hannah Miley up first
19:07 women's 400m freestyle

18.40 England win gold in the women's team gymnastics. Australia took silver and Wales bronze.
18.39 Glasgow 2014 is now Scotland's most successful Commonwealth Games after Jen McIntosh took silver in the women's 50 metres rifle three positions. Team Scotland passed their record for gold medals on Monday - winning 13 compared to the 11 picked up in 2006 - and on Tuesday moved ahead of the 33 medals won in Edinburgh in 1986. The breakdown of 13 golds, nine silvers and 12 bronzes takes them to a net figure of 34 with more than five days of action still remaining.
18.34 England are guaranteed gold now. Australia should have silver and Wales are close to bronze.
18.18 This is more like typing than reporting but, any road, Australia have not excelled on the floor. They have the beam and bars to come.
18.11 Interesting and contrasting news on headguards and their use, from Gareth:

The leading medical adviser to the England and Great Britain amateur boxing teams insisted yesterday that male boxers are safer without headguards., according to research, but that women practitioners, conversely, are safer wearing them.
The men at these Commonwealth Games are not wearing protective headgear, while the women, competing at the Games for the first time, are still compelled to don the protective head wear.
Dr Mike Loosemore told The Telegraph on Tuesday in Glasgow: "We feel that taking the headguards off is good for the boxers from a concussion point of view. Although concussion is very rare in amateur boxing, there is certainly some very good evidence that suggest the headguards increase the amount of concussion."
"Removing the headguards reduces that. We've looked at the figures and that's the case. There are approximately half the number of concussions without headguards. That sounds counter-intuitive, but we think it might be due to several things."
Loosemore, who oversaw the GB team at London 2012, added: "One, the head is bigger because of the size of the headguard, which increases the torque and the amount of force you can put through the brain when you hit the headguard. Also, your vision is restricted by the edge of the headguard and often the big blows coming in are hooks from around the side."
"And I think the biggest factor is that you might feel safer with the headguard on and therefore be inclined to leave your head where it shouldn't be. Certainly, with the headguards off, there has been a change of style in the boxing and we've seen boxers avoid getting hit a lot more."
As for women, research differs, explained Loosemore. "Because women don't punch as hard as men, the concussion rate is even lower than it is with men. We know that the cut rate does go up when removing the headguards, so it's a balance between weighing up whether it's better to leave the headguards on, and protect them from cuts, or taking them off and lowering an already very low rate of concussion. That will be an AIBA decision at the end of the day, and I've got no idea what will happen."
Loosemore added that conditioning of British boxers also continues to improve, much needed in a tournament format where they cut weight three or four times over ten days. "I think there's no doubt that centralised training and a good support team and coaching has made a great difference to the conditioning of the athletes. It's all much more controlled than it has ever been, which is really important in these tournament situations where you need to make weight not once but on four or five or even six different occasions."

18.05 The BBC's gymnastics expert and double Commonwealth champion is calling it for England.
I wouldn't write off the Australians yet because they are good on floor and beam, but I don't think they will make up that gap. I think we can pretty much say that England's women will match the men and get gold."
18.00 Here we got to BBC Two, for no reason. Stick the news on BBC Two. Does anyone really not have both BBC channels these days? It's such a meaningless gesture. NEWS MUST BE ON BBC1. Why? No one cares.
17.52 England, Scotland, Wales, one-two-three with Australia and Canada still to do their fourth rotations.
17.51 Claudia Fragapane, finishing on the floor exercise for England, has just brought the house to its feet. She scores 14.733.
17.47 There has been another gold medal for India, this time in the wrestling. England's Yana Rattigan took silver when beaten by Vinesh in the freestyle 48kgs at the SECC. Rattigan whose husband Leon won a Commonwealth Games bronze in Dehli four years ago and will fight here on Wednesday - recovered from going behind early on to lead 4-2, but trailed 6-4 at the end of round one.
Scotland's Fiona Robertson, beaten by Rattigan in their quarter-final, fought for one of the bronze medals against Rebecca Muambo of Cameroon. Muambo - who knocked the Scot's twin sister Donna out earlier in the competition - controlled the contest, beating the 45-year-old 2002 judo Commonwealth Games medalist 10-0 in less than two and a half minutes.
In the men's 57kg, Bolton wrestler Craig Pilling took bronze for Wales when he beat English teenager Omar Tafail 8-5. The gold went to Amit Kumar of India, who defeated Nigerian Ebikweminomo Welson 6-2.
17.35 It's England, Wales, South Africa in one-two-three as England prepare for four in the women's team gymnastics.
17.15 What do you think is being said here? All suggestions gratefully received.

17.10 Apologies for that short absence. To make up her is England's Dan Rivers in full Day of the Jackal mode, shooting to gold.

Now there are certain things I wish to make clear: when you've finished the work, you will hand over all the negatives and all the prints of the photographs you've just taken. You will also forget the name of Duggan, and the name on the French documents you are going to produce. Is that understood?
16.45 Women's team final after three rotations is led by Wales from South Africa.
16.40 Good evening. We seem to be in the middle of the gymnastics. As I was inquiring last night, any assistance from any reader more qualified than me, ie one with a BAGA 3, 2 or 1 badge shall be gratefully received.
16.40 I am going to pass you over to the more capable hands of my colleague Rob Bagchi who can guide you through the evening's action.
16.35 Natasha Jonas's defeat may have chalked a potential medal off England's tally but Dan Rivers has more than balanced that out with a won a shock gold in the rifle three positions. The 21-year-old from Didcot was as surprised as anyone when he won a bronze in the 10m air rifle on Friday. But he surpassed his own expectations when he saw off Indian duo Sanjeev Rajput and Gagan Narang in the event which comprises prone, kneeling and standing.
16.00 Here's Natasha Jonas after her suprise loss to Shelley Watts:
"I think the nervous energy got to me a bit but I'm an experienced athlete and there's no excuses. I'm in the shape of my life but the better person just beat me on the day."
15.54 England shooter David Luckman has claimed his second gold medal of Glasgow 2014 in the full-bore rifle Queen's Prize individual event. And Luckman doubled his tally in the gruelling three-day long-range discipline with a Games record score of 401-42, beating Canada's Jim Paton into second place with Patel taking bronze for England.
15.47 A big upset in the boxing. Here's Gareth again:
Shock for England's lightweight Natasha Jonas as she goes out to Australian Shelley Watts, who cannot contain her delight. By the way, it's absolutely packed in the boxing. Riveting atmosphere.
15.40 Anton Cooper wins the men's cross country mountain biking after the Kiwi made a stunning break with 100 metres remaining in a gruelling battle. His compatriot Samuel Gaze is second and Australia's Dan McConnell comes home third. A great great one-two for the Kiwis, who managed to stick one to the Aussies while they were at it.
15.26 One lap to go in the mountain bike cross country. After 1hr 25 mins of racing just one second separates the first four.

15.22 Wales' Ben Gregory has won the decathlon pole vault clearing 5.00m. That brings him up to fifth in the overall standings. Canada's Damian Warner leads the way with two events remaining. England's John Lane is second while Ashley Bryant is also in with a medal shout. The javelin and the 1500m are still to come - both take place tonight.

15.10 England's Aaron Heading has claimed the silver medal in the men's trap. The 27-year-old reigning Commonwealth Games champion found Australia's Adam Vella too hot to handle on the range in Dundee.
<noframe>Twitter: Andrew Osagie - Just waiting to hear the decision of our counter protest.. hopefully I get reinstated for tomorrow's semi finals.</noframe>
14.53 England have now appealed against the disqualification and Osagie, who did appear to block Thomas off down the inside, said he did nothing wrong. Here is the full story of this dispute which began at the end of their 800m heat earlier on.
14.50 It's shaping up to be classic in the men's montain biking and I should know. I used to have a mountain bike. We're on the fourth lap and there is practically nothing to separate the top four of Max Plaxton (Canada), Anton Cooper (New Zealand), Daniel McConnell (Australia) and Samuel Gaze (New Zealand).

14.45 England are guaranteed another medal as Joe Joyce beats Ross henderson to at least a bronze medal. Here's Gareth A Davies ..
England's super heavy Joe Joyce through to the semis and guaranteed a bronze medal.
Henderson is down twice in the second round through exhaustion and then dropped by a huge Joyce left hook in the last minute of the second. Joyce 10:8.
Round three and driven on by a passionate crowd, Henderson has come out all guns blazing and needs the knockout. Bang ! Kerthwack ! Boom 1 Henderson down again and the ref waves it off.
I picked out Joyce, from Liverpool, as one to watch this week, and we could well see him going to Rio to challenge in 2016.
Mentioned this last night, but it's great with no headguards. The expressions are there for all to see, as well as the fatigue and pain etched on their faces. The headguarded boxers were unrecognisable in recent years. Good move.
14.35 More from Gareth ...
As expected, these two huge 91kg+ bruisers Joyce and Henderson swinging for the fences. The Scotsman Henderson down twice in the opening round. Joyce 10-7.
14.30 Here's Gareth A Davies from the boxing arena:
Battle of the big boys here in the boxing hall. England super heavy Joe Joyce is up now against Scotland's Ross Henderson. Could be a knockout here ...
England's winning team (minus the injured Sam Oldham)
14.20 England have won the gold medal in the men's team artistic gymnastics with a total score of 266.804. Scotland have won silver with 257.603. Canada claim bronze.
14.00 The men's mountain bike final is underway. Jonathan Liew's excellent piece about Rwanda's Adrien Niyonshutis, one of those finalists, is well worth a read.
13.55 England's Andrew Osagie has been disqualified from the 800m for impeding Wales' Joe Thomas in the final dash for the line. Osagie, who finished third originally, appeared to cut across Thomas sending him into the hoarding on the inside of the track. Afterwards Osagie spoke to BBC. "I would say it wasn't his space," he said. "You can go round people on the outside. He tried to find a gap between me and another athlete. There wasn't a gap - you are only going to cause a collision and that happened."
It hasn't been seen that way by the officials who have disqualified Osagie and bumped Thomas up to third.

13.45 It's looking pretty good for Louis Smith and Co in the men's team gymnastics. They have significant lead over second-placed Scotland after four rotations. Beth Tweddle reckons that's an unassailable lead. This is despite an injury to Sam Oldham who landed awkwardly on his ankle. Up next is the parallel bars.

13.42 Another medal for England as Kristian Callaghan takes bronze in the 25m rapid fire pistol. The 21-year-old was neck and neck with double Delhi gold medallist Harpreet Singh of India and Australia's David Chapman in a closely fought final. But, needing four hits out of five in the penultimate round to move into gold-medal position, Callaghan could only manage one to slip into third. Chapman went on to take gold, with Singh settling for silver.
13.13 There will be no mountain biking medal for England - Annie Last has overtaken compatriot Alice Barnes on the final lap to finish in fourth. Barnes just about makes it home in fifth. Ahead of them there was a Canadian one-two as Catharine Pendrel takes gold and Emily Batty is second. Australia's Rebecca Henderson is third.
13.05 Our dreams of a Donna Robertson-Fiona Robertson wrestling showdown are over. Fiona goes into the repechage and could still claim bronze but Donna is out.
12.56 Rudisha wins his heat in 1:46.90. Jamaica's Cunningham crosses in second with Rimmer third. They are all guaranteed a place in the semi final. Scotland's Guy Learmonth should be OK. Rwanda's Robert Bagina got his moment in the sun when he hit the front on the half-way mark to run alongside Rudisha for a few seconds before dropping back to sixth place.
12.54 And we're off ... Rudisha hits the front early on as is his wont these days. England's Rimmer is tucked in behind.
12.52 It's David Rudisha time. The Kenyan lines up in lane 6 in the first 800m heat. Scotland's Guy Learmonth is in lane 5 and will have a tough job keeping up with his next door neighbour. England's Michael Rimmer is in lane 3.
12.49 Kaliese Spencer has also qualified with ease from her 400m hurdles heat. The Jamaican is Eilidh Child's biggest challenger for a gold medal.

12.45 Following his disappointing exit in the 110m hurdles defending champion Andy Turner has said he may call it a day after the European Championships in Zurich next month. "I am going to go to the Europeans, in my mind I have been thinking about calling it a day for a while, so if I do after the Europeans I don't know, we'll just have to wait and see how it goes."
12.32 The poster girl from these Games Eilidh Child has strolled through her heat in the 400m hurdles, looking very comfortable indeed as she laps up the acclaim of the home crowd.

12.26 Some earlier results for you. Shelly Woods won her heat in the women's 1500m T54 with Scotland's Samantha Kinghorn in third place, which means she'll also be in the final.
12.16 Yana Rattigan has proved too strong for Fiona Robertson in what has proven to be the most disappointing day for Scottish wrestling since Rowdy Roddy Piper's disqualification against Mr T at Wrestlemania 2 in 1986.

12.05 Bad news for Donna Robertson. She's been beaten 11-0 by Cameroon's Rebecca Muamba. Her sister Fiona is now in action against England's Yana Rattigan.
12.00 David Weir has won his heat in the 1500m T54.

11.50 Here's more from Ben Bloom who is so happy with how things are going in Glasgow that he may as well change his name to Ben McBloom.
Britain is on a mission to embarrass the world of athletics. A capacity Hampden Park crowd has spent the morning standing, cheering and revelling in a series of T54 1500m heats and decathlon 110m hurdles races. Compare the scene with last year's World Championships in Moscow when the number of empty seats for some of the finals outnumbered the total number of spectators inside the stadium. The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics were an unmitigated track and field success and the 2017 World Championships in London are almost certain to be the same. Can we just have everything in Britain please? Yes? Great. No more expensive air fares.
11.45 Our wrestling correspondent Ben Bloom has written some words on the potential showdown between twin sisters Donna and Fiona Robertson. You can read about it here. Their qualifiers are coming up any minute now.
11.22 Chris Tomlinson's 7.89m jump is enough to get him a place in tomorrow's final as the sixth-place qualifier. Here are the top eight qualifiers.

11.20 More on Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha's failed drugs test. Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive Mike Hooper said:
"We [have] issued a formal notice of disclosure to an athlete following an adverse analytical finding as a consequence of an in-competition test.
"That athlete is Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha who was tested on July 25th. That athlete has now been suspended from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow."
"[the substances] are diuretics and masking agents. In general terms, these substances are on the prohibited list for two reasons - firstly in weight category sports they can be used to unfairly aid weight loss... and secondly, their use has been reported in attempts to mask the presence in the body of other prohibited substances.
"The relevant processes, as detailed in our anti-doping standard for the Games, are now being followed and Ms Amalaha has pursued her right to have her 'B' sample tested.
"This will take place at an accredited laboratory in London tomorrow, July 30. Upon receipt of those results the process will continue."
11.17 England have beaten Trinidad and Tobago 70-24 in the netball.
11.10 England's Ellie Faulkner has also reached the final of the 400m freestyle, sneaking in as the eighth qualifier. The Aussies remain the team to beat however. They're like dolphins.
11.05 In the lawn bowls Sam Tolchard of England has beaten Wales's Rob Weale 21-12 in what will surely go down as a classic encounter. Of the three lawn bowls matches I've ever seen it's certainly one of the best.
A disconsolate Andy Turner after pulling up in his 110m hurdles heat (GETTY)
10.55 Disaster for defending champion Andy Turner in the 110m hurdles. He pulls up after hitting the first two hurdles in his heat and he's sitting on the track fighting back the tears. He has had a horrible year personally and professionally and it's not getting any better now. Credit to him for stopping for an interview but he's clearly upset: "Make a mistake like that at the first hurdle and it's very difficult to come back. Schoolboy error. Idiot. I'm really disappointed not to put on a better show. That was shocking."
10.52 News just breaking that Nigeria's teenage weightlifting gold medalist Chika Amalaha has failed a doping test at the Games and has been provisionally suspended .
10.45 In the pool, Scotland's Hannah Miley and the brilliantly named Jazz Carlin of Wales have finished second and third respectively behind Brittany MacLean in their women's 400m freestyle heat.

10.30 Full time: England 1 New Zealand 2. England now have two wins from three matches so all is not lost but New Zealand, who were dominated for the most part, maintain their 100 per cent record. England are now looking at the possibility of a semi-final against Australia.
10.26 Goal for New Zealand. It's a great finish by Simon Child and New Zealand lead 2-1 with just two minutes remaining. Disaster for England.
10.22 Meanwhile in the men's hockey England have equalised with a stunning Adam Dixon goal and are now pushing for a winner with six minutes remaining.
10.20 Greg Rutherford is up and running (or up, running and jumping to be more precise) landing a jump of 8.05m in his first attempt in the long jump. Job done. He's in the final. Chris Tomlinson is up next and he record 7.89m which he's not too happy with - it's also just shy of the automatic qualification mark but may still be enough to get him a place in the final once the shakedown comes.

In ther men's decathlon Canada's Damian Warner has stormed to victory in his 110m hurdles in a time of 13.51sec. There's not even another person in the camera shot as he crosses the finish line.
10.13 The Commonwealth Games is making headlines worldwide, or at least it is in Illawarra, Australia where they are celebrating the success of Emma McKeon and her brother David.

10.08 A penalty to New Zealand in the men's hockey and a controversial one at that after a referral to the video referee. Andy Hayward makes no mistake from the spot and England trail 0-1 despite having totally dominated the match. Just 19 minutes remain.
09.45 It's the end of the first quarter in the netball and England lead Trinidad and Tobago 15-5. At half time in the hockey it's 0-0 while in the lawn bowls Sam Tolchard leads Rob Weale 11-5 after 12 ends. Weale is being forced into some high risk moves like the backhand draw. It may look tranquil, but take my word for it, that's some high stakes lawn bowls action.
09.36 The women's netball match between England and Trinidad and Tobago is just getting underway. England need to win both their remaining games to keep their gold medal hopes alive. The England women's netball team, like the England men's football team, have a player called Jo hart. This is something I've just learnt. The netball team seem a little bit better than Roy Hodgosn's lot, however. They've stormed into a 4-0 lead. Meanwhile, in the men's hockey it's still England 0 New Zealand 0 with three minutes remaining in the first half.
09.25 The big Wales v England lawn bowls grudge match is underway. Wales's Rob Weale currently leads Sam Tolchard 5-4 after seven ends.
09.10 The men's hockey preliminary match between England and New Zealand has just begun on a slightly chillier Glasgow morning than the past few days. It's still 0-0 but New Zealand goalkeeper Devon Manchester has already been forced to make an impressive save low to his right.
09.00 If you're going to get photobombed it may as well be from Prince Harry ...

08.45 So the celebration of the Games so far surely goes to this guy. Those crazy ping pong players, eh?

08.30 Morning all. Welcome to day six of the Games. There is a big day ahead of us, one full of quality sporting action on the track, in the pool, on the mat, in the sand and across the pommel horse. There are old scores to be settled as Greg Rutherford and Chris Tomlinson meet in the long jump and we may well end up with the biggest sibling wrestling match since Brett 'The Hitman' Hart met Owen Hart if Scottish twins Fiona and Donna Robertson progress to face each other. Here is the full schedule for today with a few highlights picked out below. We will also have David Rudisha in action around lunchtime in the 800m.
Three events not to miss today
1 Mountain bike finals, 11.30am Mountain biking returns after it was dropped for Delhi four years ago and all the nations will be out to halt the Canadians, who have won three of the four gold medals available in Commonwealth Games history.
2 Gymnastics (artistic) team final, 4.30pm London 2012 silver medallist Louis Smith is now almost better known for his Strictly Come Dancing exploits than his Olympic pedigree, but he will hope to make the podium on his comeback as the team event reaches its climax.
3 Men’s 1500m freestyle final, 8.23pm The longest event on the swimming programme, the gruelling 1500m freestyle takes a full 15 minutes to complete and Scotland’s Stephen Milne qualified second-fastest for the final.
