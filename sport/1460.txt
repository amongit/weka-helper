Ireland captain William Porterfield makes World Cup plea to ICC
William Porterfield scored 107 in Ireland's defeat by Pakistan
15 March 2015 Last updated at 13:43
Ireland captain William Porterfield says the International Cricket Council should develop the game rather than cut the number of teams at the World Cup.
The Irish narrowly missed out on a place in the quarter-finals, but may not feature in 2019 when the tournament is reduced from 14 to 10 teams.
"Why don't 10 teams just play cricket and every other country in the world not bother?" said Porterfield.
"It's the ICC, supposedly global. They have to develop the game."
Batsman Porterfield was speaking after Ireland's seven-wicket defeat by Pakistan, which meant they missed out on a spot in the last eight on net run rate after winning half of their six Pool B games.

Ireland have beaten a Test nation in three successive World Cups, with their victories in Australia and New Zealand including wins over West Indies and Zimbabwe.
"We've shown what we can do," said the Warwickshire left-hander. "The ICC can't say that they are having fewer teams to make the World Cup shorter, because the next tournament is longer than this one."
Eight places in the next tournament will be allocated according to the world rankings, with Ireland likely to compete for the two remaining spots in a qualifying competition in Bangladesh.

If they fail to qualify, it would be the first World Cup without the Irish since 2007.
"I'd love to think that we haven't played our last World Cup game," said 30-year-old Porterfield. "I'm sure the ICC are hoping everything blows over and they don't hear much from us, then it's easy to sweep under the carpet."
Ireland have the opportunity to earn Test status via the 2017 Intercontinental Cup, but Porterfield says his team need more one-day internationals against top sides before thinking about playing the longer form of the game.
"Yes, it's something we want and the pathway is there, but we need to play the volume of fixtures before we get to that stage," he said.
"Ireland are always competitive. You rarely watch an Ireland team play a top team and it is over at halfway. Of all the associate nations over the last two World Cups, Ireland are the ones who stand out."
"We have six weeks until the next game, a one-off fixture against England. It's great that we've got that fixture, but it's a big gap. Those are the gaps that need to be filled before we build for Test status."
Ireland would have reached the last eight for the second time if they had beaten Pakistan in Adelaide, but saw their total of 237 overhauled with 23 balls to spare.
"It's difficult to say it was a missed opportunity," added Porterfield. "We've beaten two Test nations and played some very good cricket.
"We're disappointed. We came in with high hopes because we believe we can beat anyone. When we sit and reflect, we can be very happy with what we have achieved."

The idea of 16 teams and a 4x4 league stage makes sense- except for one thing. Last time it was tried- 2007- India and Pakistan went out at the first hurdle. The ICC is frightened of a repeat of that situation.
World cricket is dominated by England, Australia and, especially, India. Indian television is only interested in India - and really only when they play full members. If cricket restricts itself to just the eight top countries and two Associates then it will contract and eventually whither. For 2019 there should be sixteen nations, at least. In the UK it should also be on terrestrial television.
I support Sachin Tendulkar's idea - Tendulkar said he believes cricket's global fan base will only grow if the Associates improve to the level where they can be consistently competitive and he believes the first step is to schedule regular matches against second-string sides from the Full Members nations and see, not just 14 teams, but get to 25 teams participating in the next World Cup?"
"Perhaps a combined team from the UK would be a solution. "That's already been done with South Africans and Zimbabweans thrown in too. They are called "England".
@80 - hey hainba - yes, still managing to hang on - hope your daughter's still scoring runs/taking wickets. - I've been following this tournament closely, although Antipodean hours play havoc with European clocks! :) They ought to have a competition for the best live-text line. My favourite so far is "kiwis are flying" haha - That confounds the natural world!
looking at Ireland's results the only one that stands out as a disappointment is the loss to Pakistan, S.A and India are powerhouses, they certainly did better than the other associates. They are better than Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, the West Indies, England and maybe Pakistan. OK so they aren't at the level of the big guns like India, N.Z, Australia, S.A and Sri Lanka but who else is ?
Keep the minnows in. Some of the associate nations don't have much to celebrate when it comes to sport. Nations like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh don't follow any other sport, Cricket is the only sport they compete in and look how their inclusion has benefited their team and Cricket for their respective countries.Let IRE, AFG and UAE have some sporting achievement to be proud of.
84. aliborThe real reason is money. Cricket doesn't have a natural following in Ireland/Scotland/UAE. They want the big TV audiences to follow it and 1 guy watching it in a pub in Ireland doesn't help.
Of course, the real reason for reducing the length of the next WC in England is because it will disrupt the summer cricket season here and upset the counties programme.
