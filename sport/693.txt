FULL TIME: ITALY 0 FRANCE 29

Mathieu Bastareaud scored France's second try in Rome
<noframe>Twitter: George Penn - Don't think I can remember seeing a team play that badly and win by 29 points <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
<noframe>Twitter: Valerio Scalabrelli - The worst game of this <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236Nations" target="_blank">#6Nations</a>' season. And Italy conceded 3 tries to the worst offense of the tournament. That's it. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>

It was a nightmare afternoon for Sergio Parisse and Italy in Rome
It wasn't pretty and it wasn't that entertaining but France have got the job done in the Stadio Olimpico and after all of Les Bleus' recent woes, Philippe Saint-Andre will be a mightily relieved man. It was an error strewn contest but 29 points represents a thumping victory and rather bizarrely, the result means that France still retain a slim chance of winning the Six Nations title.
80 min. FRANCE TRY. Italy 0 France 29. Bastareaud bulldozes his way over in injury time from all of a metre and France have a second try. Plisson adds the extras with the final kick of the match and Les Bleus are convincing winners in Rome.
<noframe>Twitter: Emma Thurston - 37 handling errors in this match... this time the stats don't lie! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
78 min France camped in the Italian 22 and it looks as though the Azzurri will not be breaking their duck...
76 min Like Parisse, the game now limping to its inevitable conclusion and there's scant urgency from either side to be brutally honest.
75 min Italy's day gets even worse as Parisse limps dejectedly to the touchline. Will the skipper be fit to face Wales next weekend?
74 min France steal possession after making a mess of the Italy scrum again but the Azzurri defence holds firm as Les Bleus go wide through substitute Bastareaud.
<noframe>Twitter: Dan George - Man of the match should go to JP Doyle, consistent performance. Stood out from the two other teams <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rbs_6_nations" target="_blank">@rbs_6_nations</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23awfulgame" target="_blank">#awfulgame</a></noframe>

70 min Points - any form of points - are what Italy desperately need. Thye're not going to win this one but failing to score at home would be a chastening experience indeed.
69 min Italy finally get the rolling maul going in the French 22 but then concede a needless penalty and France are able to clear their lines.

<noframe>Twitter: Bea Asprey - Wonder if Jacques Brunel has cracked open a bottle of his own wine yet? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
65 min France go close as Plisson deploys the cross field kick to the corner but Huget cannot gather and Italy are reprieved.
63 min Italy are pinged for crossing in midfield and the look on the faces of the Azzurri players says it all - it's been a horrible day for the home side in every department.
60 min Italy still trying to muscle their way through the French lines but getting very little change from Les Bleus. France get a penalty on the 10 metre line but signal their intent to go for the jugular by turning down the possible three points and kick instead for touch.

Yoann Maestri scores for France against Italy in the Stadio Olimpico
56 min. FRANCE PENALTY! Italy 0 France 22. Plisson rubs salt into the Italian wounds with another penalty and the Azzurri are now in grave danger of getting a real thumping in Rome.
54 min France pulverise the Italian scrum once again and it's another penalty to the visitors. Plisson belts it into touch and France have a significant advantage up front now.
53 min Ghiraldini knocks on and the first signs of frustration in the Italian ranks are beginning to surface.

50 min Italy camped in French territory but the visitors are happy enough to soak up the pressure up front and Italy forced to go wide.
<noframe>Twitter: show - The Italian team haven't turned up, which is a surprise given they are at home <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23bbc6nations" target="_blank">#bbc6nations</a></noframe>
47 min Italy have the proverbial mountain to climb now while for the first time in this year's Six Nations, France can actually relax and try and enjoy themselves.
<noframe>Twitter: Ian Price - Man runs with ball, man passes ball, man scores try. Simple game. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23rugby" target="_blank">#rugby</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
45 min. FRANCE TRY. Italy 0 France 19. A great, sweeping French counter attack featuring Spedding and Goujon sees second row Maestri rumble over for the opening try of the match, his first try in 35 Tests. Plisson is on target with the conversion and France are suddenly streets ahead.
<noframe>Twitter: Edward Beer - Whatever happened to rugby players wearing grip gloves? They might be useful in this game <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
42 min. FRANCE PENALTY! Italy 0 France 12. Parisse is penalised for holding on and with only his second touch of the match, Plisson knocks over the penalty and France are into double figures.
41 min Lopez does not reappear and Jules Plisson is on at fly-half for the French.
41 min France get the second half in the Stadio Olimpico started and we shall see whether these two sides can muster up more appetising fare over the next 40 minutes...
<noframe>Twitter: David Burnham - How on Earth are France 9 points ahead ? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23yawn" target="_blank">#yawn</a></noframe>

France scored three first-half penalties against Italy in the Stadio Olimpico

<noframe>Twitter: Ed Milne - Seems like you're more likely to catch a cold than the ball if you're playing rugby in Rome at the moment <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23butterfingers" target="_blank">#butterfingers</a></noframe>
HALF-TIME: ITALY 0 FRANCE 9
It would be disingenuous to describe the first 40 minutes in Rome as anything but shambolic but France will not be perturbed, snaffling as they have nine unanswered points. The error count from both sides is too high and although the wet conditions are a mitigating factor, both sides will be disappointed with their respective displays so far.
40 min. FRANCE PENALTY! Italy 0 France 9. The Italian scrum wilts under a French onsalught and is shoved unceremoniously backwards. Doyle inevitably awards France the penalty and Spedding steps up in place of Lopez - who's limping badly - to slot the penalty.
38 min Morisi off for now. His little mishap on the sidelines seemingly the result of a blow to the head and Italy are taking no chances with the centre.
37 min Break in play as Morisi parts company with his pre-match meal on the touchline!
<noframe>Twitter: Ã&permil;lann Carel - Anybody else feel like there are invisible banana skins on the field in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Rome" target="_blank">#Rome</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SixNations" target="_blank">#SixNations</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Rugby" target="_blank">#Rugby</a></noframe>
35 min Spedding beats three tacklers to move up to the Italy 22 but France then spill the ball and the Azzurri are able to clear.
34 min. FRANCE PENALTY! Italy 0 France 6. The Italians unwisely come in from the side at the breakdown. Doyle is not a happy referee and Lopez knocks over the penalty that ensues to move France further clear.
<noframe>Twitter: Victoria Buswell - This game is full of errors. This is suppose to be an international match. Calm down. Recycle the ball. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
30 min It's still incredibly scrappy in the Stadio Olimpico at the moment and trench warfare up front rather than a feast of running rugby out wide is the order of the day.

28 min. FRANCE PENALTY! Italy 0 France 3. Italy are caught offside and Lopez steps forward to finally break the deadlock with a penalty and give France the advantage.

Fly-half Tommy Allan was forced off with injury early in the first half in Rome
24 min Crowd get excited as Venditti finds a sliver of space on the right wing but it's all over in an instant as Doyle brings them back for a forward pass.
23 min First real sign of French flair as Huget attempts an attack from deep. He makes a few metres before he's wrapped up by the Italian midfield.
<noframe>Twitter: Matt J - Slow game so far. Both sides feeling the strain of the conditions I think<a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23rbs6nations" target="_blank">#rbs6nations</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nazioni" target="_blank">#6nazioni</a></noframe>
20 min The Italians are pinged for collapsing the scrum but Spedding is off target with the penalty and it's still 0-0! Interesting that Spedding and not Lopez was give the kicking duties there...
17 min France enjoy a spell of possession in the Italy half but turn the ball over and rather abruptly find themselves forced to turn and retreat.
<noframe>Twitter: iamafish - Italy down to their third choice 10. Big problems for a key position that Italy have often struggled to fill <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
15 min Orquera hits the upright with a penalty attempt! It was a decent effort from range from the new boy but it's still scoreless in Rome.

13 min Italy finally put some width on the ball and make space for Sarto but he's well marshalled into touch by Huget. Meanwhile, Allan is off with a thigh strain and Orquera is on for Italy.
10 min Italy are back in French territory after a French knock on but the visitors' defence is robust for the moment and this game hasn't really caught fire yet.
<noframe>Twitter: Accenture Rugby - Italy will rely on their set piece today but France are currently the only team with a scrum and lineout success rate over 90%. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a></noframe>
7 min The French are pinged for killing the ball on the floor but Allan is wayward with the resulting penalty and it remains scoreless in Rome.
5 min Two successive penalties conceded by France allows Italy to get out of their own half and there's already been a couple of minor scuffles between the forwards. Tempers fraying...
<noframe>Twitter: Jeremy Inson - Where was the Fijian goose-step when it was needed? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Itavfra" target="_blank">#Itavfra</a></noframe>
3 min Great counter attack from deep from the new French wing Nakaitaci but he's eventually bundled into touch by Parisse on the Italian 22.
2 min Italy made the first foray into enemy territory with a series of drives from the pack before Allan launches an aerial bomb but Spedding is safe under the high ball and calls the mark.
1 min Our referee JP Doyle blows his whistle, Italy kick and we're up and running in the Stadio Olimpico.
14.58 The two anthems have been sung lustily and we're nearly ready for the action in Rome.
<noframe>Twitter: Emma Thurston - Think it could be an interesting <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rbs_6_nations" target="_blank">@rbs_6_nations</a> eighty ahead, will France turn up?

<noframe>Twitter: mark patterson - Love Parisse but wouldn't it be lovely to see some proper old skool flowing french rugby today? Unlikely. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/RTErugby" target="_blank">@RTErugby</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ghook" target="_blank">@ghook</a></noframe>
14.54 It's been raining heavily in Rome. The two teams making their way out their respective dressing rooms out onto the Stadio Olimpico pitch...

14.52 Until the coach finds a winning formula however – Les Bleus have won a meagre 14 of 35 Tests since he succeeded Marc Lievremont in 2011 – you suspect Saint-Andre will remain a man in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A defeat in Rome today would only heap yet more pressure on him.
<noframe>Twitter: Rugby Radio - Italy have scored six tries in their last two Tests, while France have only scored three in their last four. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ITAvFRA" target="_blank">#ITAvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SixNations" target="_blank">#SixNations</a></noframe>
14.50 It’s been a torrid couple of weeks for Saint-Andre but the coach was in pugnacious mood when asked by an increasingly hostile French media whether he had considered quitting…
I've never abandoned ship, whether as a player, as a captain or as a manager. I've been given a role: to prepare this team for the World Cup. I'll fight every day to do that.”
14.47 Centres Maxime Mermoz and Gael Fickou make up a new midfield partnership in the absence of Lamerat and Fofana. Scott Spedding returns at full-back while Noa Nakaitaci makes his Test debut on the left wing in place of injured Sofiane Guitoune. Loann Goujon is handed a first start at number eight and Nicolas Mas comes in at tighthead prop for Rabah Slimani, who has been dropped to the bench. Romain Taofifeuna and Damien Chouly drop out of the starting XV altogether while half-backs Rory Kockott and Jules Plisson are named among the substitutes.

Captain Thierry Dusautoir will be hoping for a French revival in Rome this afternoon
14.43 There was more than a whiff of panic in Philippe Saint-Andre’s selection for today’s game, the France head coach unveiling a remarkable eight changes to the XV that were ambushed by Wales a fortnight ago. In his defence, Morgan Parra, Remi Lamerat and Wesley Fofana are all injured but that the rest of the changes were not enforced.

14.40 Today is a 112th Test appearance for the seemingly evergreen Italy skipper Sergio Parisse, making the 31-year-old number eight the most capped player in Azzurri history as he overtakes Marco Bortolami’s previous record. Incredibly just three of his previous 111 caps have come as a substitute.

14.38 The omens may be good for Italy but Brunel is refusing to be lulled into any false sense of security…
France have one win and two defeats, like us. There's a bit more confidence for us and a little less for them, but they remain favourites all the same. You must never trust the last impressions of the French, they're capable of changing their mood and laying down a performance from another level up so be aware! Always!"
14.35 Italy head coach Jacques Brunel has made three changes to the side that overcame Scotland in Edinburgh two weeks ago. Fijian-born flanker Samuela Vunisa gets the nod in the back row while out wide Leonardo Sarto replaces Michele Visentin on the wing and Andrea Masi is handed the number 12 shirt in place of Enrico Bacchin.

Philippe Saint-Andre's side have endured a miserable Six Nations campaign
14.30 This fixture doesn’t really require any additional hype but it would be remiss not to remind you the two teams are scheduled to cross swords again in September at Twickenham in Pool D of the World Cup. Psychological markers and all that…
14.25 Add in the startling statistic that the French have won just one of their last 12 Tests on the road – their 19-17 success against Scotland at Murrayfield in last season’s Championship – and it’s not too hard to predict an Italian victory this afternoon.
<noframe>Twitter: Sophie Hay - Seen French supporters wearing berets &amp; stripy tshirts &amp; an Italian dressed as an ancient Roman.

14.18 France of course remain the more illustrious half of this particular rugby rivalry but Italy have won the last two times Les Bleus have descended on Rome, winning 23-18 in 2013 and 22-21 two years earlier. The Azzurri, it seems, are becoming accustomed to upsetting the French in the capital.

14.15 After last week’s dramatic last-gasp victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, the rejuvenated Italians will be licking their lips at the prospect of beating Les Bleus at the Stadio Olimpico while the only thing the French have been licking over the past fortnight following a demoralising defeat to Wales in Paris is their collective wounds.
