Warrington head coach Tony Smith is expecting an "epic" match against Super League champions St Helens on Thursday.
Saints have won every game in the league so far this season, while Wolves have only been beaten once.
Smith's side ended Leeds Rhinos' unbeaten start to the 2015 campaign last week and will be looking to do the same to Keiron Cunningham's side.
"It's always an epic game between the two of us," 48-year-old Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"They had that terrific record on us for many, many years that they kept at their old ground.
"I know they'll turn up with a lot of spirit as they're a very spirited team."
Warrington won 39-12 at Langtree Park last year after losing their season opener at home to Saints, while Wolves also beat their rivals at the Magic Weekend in May.
