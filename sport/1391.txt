Coverage: BBC Sport website, BBC Radio 5 live & BBC local radio
Burton Albion's Florent Cuvelier hopes to recover from a hamstring strain to make his home debut.
Cuvelier scored as a substitute at Hartlepool but missed Saturday's win over Accrington, while Callum Reilly is also pushing for his full debut.
Southend pair Barry Corr (foot) and Ben Coker (abductor) will feature if they can shake off minor injury problems.
Phil Brown's side are unbeaten in their last four matches and will move within five points of Burton with victory.
