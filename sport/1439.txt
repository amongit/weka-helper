Davis Cup: Why Great Britain may return to Glasgow for quarter-finals
Great Britain beat the United States 3-2 in their Davis Cup World Group tie at the Emirates Arena
9 March 2015 Last updated at 10:05
The Emirates Arena produced the best atmosphere Andy Murray says he has ever played in.
This Davis Cup weekend was an unqualified success, which is why France may also be invited to the east end of Glasgow in the third week of July.
Planning for a potential quarter-final began before the first-round tie with the United States. Grass is an obvious starting point for any team fielding Andy Murray in the week after Wimbledon, but the options are more limited than they first appear.
The All England Club did stage a Davis Cup tie in the week after Wimbledon 2000, but the LTA says it has already been ruled out this year. The baselines suffer more wear and tear these days and the quality of the court could deteriorate alarmingly if it was subjected to four days of practice and three more days of play.
The Queen's Club does not wish the Aegon Championships stands to remain in place for a further four weeks, which appears to leave Eastbourne as the only established grass-court venue with a big enough capacity. The regular sea breeze may count against it, however, and Devonshire Park does not have a track record as the most atmospheric of venues.

Andy Murray seals Davis Cup 2015 quarter-final place for Great Britain
Murray's initial assessment was that grass would suit his game and assist Dom Inglot's serve. He feels that with the exception of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga - who has not played yet this season because of an arm injury - potential members of the French team would not relish a tie on grass.
So captain Leon Smith's first move is to decide, in conjunction with his team, whether grass would offer GB an advantage they dare not concede.
But if the benefits are not considered to be all that great, then a hard court - which may suit James Ward better - is the other option. And although it seems a little perverse to stage a tie indoors in one of the few months of the year when the weather can usually be relied upon, the noise generated and retained under a roof is hard to emulate.
Smith believes passionately Scotland should have the opportunity to stage more of the sport's big events, and with five consecutive weeks of grass-court tournaments in England in the run up to the quarter-final, Glasgow may again prove a compelling option.
The Hydro (which staged the boxing and the netball finals of last year's Commonwealth Games) could house more spectators than the Emirates, but Bette Midler got in first and is performing there on the Monday of Davis Cup week, which makes a return to the scene of Britain's first-round triumph a real possibility.
Serbia thumped Croatia 5-0 in their Davis Cup World Group tie at the weekend
Once the venue is sorted - the LTA must inform the International Tennis Federation of its choice by 7 April - a strategy to beat France must be unearthed.
With the exception of a Serbia team featuring world number one Novak Djokovic and his good friend Viktor Troicki (who is fuelled by the sense of injustice he still feels at being banned for failing to take a blood test), France are the one team you would prefer to avoid.
Last year's runners-up have seven players in the world's top 40 and it would take another exceptional effort from James Ward to beat performers of the calibre of Tsonga, Gael Monfils, Gilles Simon and Richard Gasquet.
Murray, though, has won nearly 80% of his matches against those four, so another tight contest appears likely.
Smith's choice of doubles pair will be vital, and he has an increasing number of options. Jamie Murray and Inglot were a fine scratch pairing against the Bryans, Inglot's eye-catching performance may earn him the chance to play alongside Andy Murray in future ties, and Colin Fleming is likely to be hard to leave out when he hits full stride after taking January off for the birth of his first child.
Logic dictates a country is very unlikely to win the Davis Cup with only one player in the world's top 50, but this year's competition feels more open than many.
France and Serbia are the only quarter-finalists who were able to field two top-50 players last weekend, Spain are spending the year seeking promotion back to the World Group and, having been deprived of the services of Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka, champions Switzerland are already out.
So can Britain win their quarter-final with France?
The answer may have less to do with the choice of venue, and more with the form and fitness of the key protagonists, who will have played at both the French Open and Wimbledon in the seven weeks leading up to the tie.

Many of us travelled from all over Great Britain to Glasgow to cheer for GB in Davis Cup, just as we do wherever it is held. The location isn't important. The surface is.
Wherever they play, it is crucial that Britain have that home advantage as France have a strong team
@83. Posted by cherzo "so much hatred of the scots on here by the english, sad sad sad"~~~What did you expect ?SNP want a divided nation...well guess what...
Pity to go indoors but if it has to be then let's have a fast surface, nothing slow please
I have been a tennis fan since I was child, now in my 60s this is the first chance I have had to see top class tennis live, but people grudge me that. If the next match somewhere else I will still watch on TV and cheer just as loudly. I am amazed at the hate on here and saddened too.
so much hatred of the scots on here by the english, sad sad sad
@SMFC1987 "Glasgow provided the best atmosphere"best atmosphere compared to what?Davis Cup gets great support wherever it is played - the atmosphere at the NIA was just as good as at the Emirates, so I see no reason why it can't be played there again.If they want grass then it will have to be Queens or Eastbourne, but it would be nice to have more live tennis outside SE England!
Everybody needs to get away form the idea that the Scottish referendum was about being anti-English or anti-British. I can't deny that there are some who voted on those grounds but my wife is English and voted Yes, I am Scottish and voted No. Fo rmost it was about a more represesntative government. This HYS is about tennis though and it was great, let us stick to that.
Why do we an opportunity to comment on where the next Davis cup might be held but not on the ignominious exit of England from the cricket world cup. We face the distinct possibility the no team from the British Isles will progress to the Knockout stages but the BBC does not see fit for supporters to make a comment. SAD.
@ 76 OwlsoflaughterMurray himself watched and supported the Team GB in the Davis Cup / Wimbledon in an era when Scotland had no players involved.Yes any passionate Tennis supporter in Scotland would watch the Davis Cup whether there were Scots or not.I agree the passion and noise is hightened when someone from your own country is taking part - no different to any other country
