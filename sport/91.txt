Manny Pacquiao welcomes Tim Tebow to his training camp
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Manny Pacquiao welcomed a high-profile visitor to his training camp Saturday with ties to his native Philippines: Tim Tebow.
Pacquiao is preparing for his much-anticipated fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. on May 2 in Las Vegas. The Heisman Trophy-winning former Florida QB posted photos on Instagram of the two together in Pacquiao's gym in Los Angeles.
''Awesome being with my Filipino and Christian brother,'' Tebow posted on his Instagram account.
Tebow, who is known for being very open about his Christian faith, was born in the Philippines to missionary parents.
Pacquiao spokesman Fred Sternburg said Tebow and Pacquiao know each other and embraced when Tebow came to the gym.
Promoter Bob Arum was also there and they watched Pacquiao spar seven rounds, Sternburg said.
''Bob said when he left Tebow was still there,'' Sternburg said. ''They seemed to be getting along.''
