Abby Wambach Black Eye: FIFA Reviewing 'Sucker-Punch' To U.S. Women's Soccer Star
MANCHESTER, England -- The disciplinary committee of world soccer's governing body is reviewing the hit to the face that left U.S. forward Abby Wambach with a black eye during a game against Colombia at the Olympics.
FIFA spokesman Alex Stone said no update was expected before Monday.
Wambach said she was "sucker-punched" in the right eye by Lady Andrade in the 39th minute of Saturday's 3-0 win over Colombia. After the game, Wambach called for FIFA to take action, while Andrade called the play "an accident."
The U.S. team did not file a formal complaint against Andrade, but it did contact FIFA about the play.
"I think it's important that you recognize it," U.S. coach Pia Sundhage said. "I watched it on video, and I'd say it's very unusual, playing like that and trying to get her out of the game.
She added: "That doesn't belong in the game."
Wambach, still sporting a shiner, said Sunday she was fine. She'll be able to play in the Americans' final group game Tuesday against North Korea.
