Hosting an Olympics is hard, but Rio 2016 Games Organisers have support from all corners despite scrutiny

Organising and staging an Olympic and Paralympic Games is hard. Take it from someone who has had a go at it and got the proverbial T-shirt.
The cities that make it are a select band, and they are acutely aware of what is at stake and, lest they forget, there are plenty of voices, domestically and internationally, reminding them.
Over seven years a lot can change in the world, in a country and in a city. In 2009 when the Games were awarded to Rio, the BRIC states (before South Africa joined) held their first formal summit. The four members were all developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by significant and rapidly growing economies. It did not seem wrong then to award the Games to a much-loved city of one of those countries, a city that had two years earlier hosted a good Pan American Games, is passionate about sport and it does not seem wrong now.
At its heart it was a brave decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) but then we expect that from the IOC. This is an organisation that in the late 1950s encouraged and then welcomed Tokyo back into the international fold by awarding them the 1964 Games and then a decade later Munich. In the early 70s the IOC made another brave decision with Moscow hosting the 1980 Games. I competed in those Games and liked to think I was in the vanguard of change although, of course it was not universally seen as such at the time. It took another decade for profound change. But as so often sport is the catalyst. And it was in that decade that South Korea, which at that stage was only recognised diplomatically by half the world, that the IOC awarded the 1988 Summer Games to Seoul. Add to that the encouragement former President of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, gave Beijing way back in the early 1990s and you can see this is an organisation that doesn’t just mirror events it often sets the trend.
What the IOC does not do is leave host cities to flounder or fail. It works alongside the organising committee, provides guidance, shares knowledge and best practice and adds support where required without fuss or headlines. And not just that, it puts its money where its mouth is - the IOC puts back more than 90 per cent of its income into sport.

And the IOC is constantly trying to improve the service it offers and the help it gives to organising committees like Rio 2016. Right now the IOC is in the process of fundamentally reappraising what it does and how it operates. The process is called Olympic Agenda 2020 but what it means in concrete terms for ‘future Rios’ is that the Olympic Movement is looking at how cities bid for the Games and how the Games can be made to work better for the host city and the host population.
Two years out from any Games is one of the hardest periods any organising committee enters. The Winter Games are finished and you really are the next one out of the blocks.
The spotlight turns on to you and with it the unremitting glare of the public and media drawing attention to every shortcoming. And here no organising committee chair should be coy or naive. It is inevitable that there will be shortcomings. A project of this scale and complexity is not the project management of unalloyed joy. Two years out from the London 2012 Games we had no idea we would have been twinned with Atlantis and submerged in a deluge of rain for the weeks leading into the Games making our task of erecting our highly acclaimed temporary facilities a nail-biting experience for our teams.
But no matter how hard it got. No matter how cynical or what back biting came from some quarters we always knew that the International Olympic Committee, the International Sports Federations and the National Olympic and Paralympic Committees and our commercial partners from around the world were there to step in, to step up and help when we needed them.
The Rio 2016 Games Organisers know this too. Two years out, with or without a World Cup, is just plain tough for an organising committee and their delivery partners. Clocks seem to go faster than at any other time in that seven-year delivery. Some decisions need to be reversed, changed or speeded up. The delivery of a Games is often the art of hour-by-hour refinement. In September 2010 I had to make one of the toughest decisions of my tenure as Chair of London 2012 - change the route of the Marathon.
This was not for the oft quoted ‘TV shots’ reason but because, laid on top of the many other events and complexity across the capital on that day, we would have grid locked the city. This was the advice from my team and our partners. We needed to make a decision and we did it with them and our Olympic partners by our side. These are not great times. They need sound leadership and strong resolute decision-making - not all decisions will be received with a warm embrace and a standing ovation. But they still need to be made and supported.
I know the Rio Organising Committee well. I know they are a thoroughly decent, talented and hard working team of people. They know there is much to do. They know that the World Cup will be a global litmus test and judgments will be made about them in all corners of the world. They know the responsibility they have to their people, their city, their country and of course the Olympic and Paralympic athletes and the watching world. They also know they can count on the IOC and the wider Olympic movement to help them where they need it.
My advice to the Rio organising team is that there will be greater scrutiny over the next two years. That is inevitable. Every missed deadline or error, perceived or real, will be raked over time and time again. However, they know they have access to some of the finest minds and a wealth of expertise in the Olympic movement and they are, and will, all help. No single organisation puts on a Games. It is a collaborative team effort and now is the time for those who can to step up and help.
I am forever grateful for the support, advise and expertise the London 2012 Games received from our own people and communities as well as the wider international sporting family and of course our Olympic and Paralympic partners. It was this team effort that created a Games that made Britain proud. It is this team effort that will make the Rio Games in 2016 a festival of sport that will again unite the world.
