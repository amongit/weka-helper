Regis Philbin Returning To TV With Fox Sports 1 Show
Regis Philbin will reportedly return to TV in a new sports show on Fox Sports 1 (see update below).
According to the New York Post, Philbin will host a sports show featuring a panel of hosts, similar to the ABC daytime talk show "The View." Philbin will take on a Barbara Walters-type role on the panel. The show will debut in August.
The network is expected to make an official announcement on Tuesday. Philbin was on CNBC on Wednesday and was asked about the rumored sports show. "Major announcement next Tuesday," he reportedly said.
Since Philbin left "Live! With Regis and Kelly" in November 2011, he has appeared on various TV shows. He guest-starred on TV Land's "Hot in Cleveland," was a regular guest on Rachael Ray's daytime talk show, and even filled in for Hoda Kotb during the "Today" show's fourth hour.

UPDATE (11:45 a.m.): Philbin appeared on "The View" Monday and preempted his Tuesday announcement by revealing some details about the new show. "Fox is starting a sports channel. Everybody is starting a sports channel now, you know, nothing but 24-hours of sports ... So Regis is going to have a show on that," he said.
