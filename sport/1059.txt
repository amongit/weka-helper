Premier League's biggest clubs demand compensation if Qatar 2022 World Cup moves to November and December

The Premier League’s biggest clubs will demand compensation from any move of the 2022 World Cup to the winter, it was confirmed on Tuesday.
The European Club Association – the members of which include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City – announced it would seek reparations for any loss of revenue should Fifa’s executive committee ratify a switch of the tournament in Qatar to November-December next month.
That appears a foregone conclusion following Tuesday’s final meeting of a task force established to examine such a move, which included the ECA.
Its chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, said: “For the football family, the rescheduling of the Fifa World Cup 2022 presents a difficult and challenging task. All match calendars across the world will have to accommodate such tournament in 2022-23, which requires everyone’s willingness to compromise.
“However, the European clubs and leagues cannot be expected to bear the costs for such rescheduling. We expect the clubs to be compensated for the damage that a final decision would cause.”

The ECA has yet to estimate the cost of a winter World Cup to its members, which number 214 clubs from 53 countries, including 10 teams from England.
Gate receipts, broadcast contracts and income from lucrative pre-season and mid-season tours could all be affected.
Asked 18 months ago about the prospect of compensation, Fifa’s secretary general Jérôme Valcke said: “No, no, no. Compensation is a word you should never use.”
Since then, Fifa has awarded some of its television rights to the 2026 World Cup to existing broadcast partners without going out to tender.
