Jurgen Klopp has called for an "exceptional game" from Borussia Dortmund in their bid to stay in the Champions League.
Dortmund hope to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Juventus to progress to the last eight.
Klopp's side are unbeaten in their last six Bundesliga games, helping them to climb off the bottom up to 10th.
"Juventus are a clever side, but they are not invincible. We know we need an exceptional game," Klopp said.
Dortmund, who beat Juventus 3-1 to win the Champions League final in 1997, have failed to score in their last two domestic matches.
They are unbeaten at home in Europe this season, and Klopp added: "We face the greatest challenge there is in football, to score against an Italian team which will advance with a 0-0 draw.
Juventus, who won the first-leg in Turin 2-1, are unbeaten in 18 league games
"We know how to be dangerous, we know how to score. We just have to use the right spaces, take the right decision.
"That has been rare in the last two games, but we don't need to win 9-0, just 1-0."
The German side face a difficult task against Juventus, who lead Serie A by 14 points from second-placed Roma.
Coach Massimiliano Allegri says his side will not sit back and defend their slender first-leg lead.
He said: "We go into the game with an advantage, but we know the difficulties of the task ahead of us.
"I am confident it will be an interesting game and I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score twice it would be great."
