Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman is hopeful that his son will be born after Super Bowl Sunday but should an early arrival occur, coach Pete Carroll says he will leave it to the player to decide how he responds. Sherman’s girlfriend Ashley is due to give birth early next month and is in Phoenix for the game against New England Patriots. That has raised questions over whether, if she went into labour tomorrow, Sherman would miss the game.
“That is up to Richard,” Carroll said. “Whenever our players have a personal or family issue that comes up, it’s always about family first, and they have to decide what’s best for them, and I support that.”
Sherman is hoping that he does not have to make a choice between being at the birth or playing in the NFL’s championship game.
“I think he’s going to be a disciplined young man and stay until after the game,” Sherman said. “I would not like to miss the birth of my first kid, but hopefully and God willing, we won’t have to cross that bridge.”
Sherman would not give any indication of his son’s likely name but Carroll joked that he had one in mind. “I’m looking forward to seeing Little Petey,” the coach said with a grin.
