You could ask no more of Ireland than this. They reeled in Wales and set the bar too high for England. They played a game that was a devastating combination of skill, power and purpose, hammering Scotland in every phase and bettering them in every position. They are deserving Six Nations champions.
Attention will focus on England coming up short. But we should look instead to how Ireland made England's task impossible. Collectively, they were magnificent; individually no less so. Sean O'Brien had an immense game, measured by his two tries and a man of the match award, in which he made a mockery of Scotland's efforts to get their phases going.

Paul O'Connell sets towering standards for himself, but he lived up to them yet again, a dominating presence in every area of the game.
"It was a bizarre day, an incredible day," smiled O'Connell after he had been handed the Six NAtions trophy. "I suppose a lot of things did happen in our favour. For three games to go like that and for us to come out on top, maybe someone was smiling down on us. It has been an incredible day.

"We would have loved to have produced rugby lie that more often. At times we did, we just didn't finish so it didn't look like we were doing it. Any time you win a championship it is incredible; I don't care what way we play. It is an amazing achievement and an amazing feeling."
Not for Scottish fans though. Alarmingly, even staggeringly, this was the third time in this year's Six Nations that the Scots failed to score a point after the break. Other numbers told an equally grim tale. They had the put-in at scrums only twice - and even managed to lose one of those - while their errors gave Ireland scrum ball 10 times. They won three turnovers; Ireland won 12. Rugby statistics whould be handled with caution, but those figures measured a gulf between the teams.


It was one achievement that Scotland trailed by just 10 points at the interval - 10-20 - but there was a period during the first half when they seemed almost determined to help Ireland vault the bar Wales had raised in the first game of the day. The Scots have generally been pretty sound in defence in this championship, but Ireland blew holes in their line and the points quickly mounted.
The first blast came in the fifth minute, when Ireland won clean lineout ball near halfway on the right side. Jonny Sexton whizzed the ball left, and a lovely interplay in midfield sent Robbie Henshaw careering over the 22. Henshaw was hauled down a few yards short, but Ireland churned through a few phases and Paul O'Connell lumbered round the side of a ruck to score.
With the conversion and a penalty in the next few minutes, Glasgow were in double figures before the clock got there. Greig Laidlaw clipped over a penalty to Scotland to cut the gap, but the Irish onslaught kept coming.
When the Scots failed to clear their lines properly, Ireland struck again. This time the lineout was on the left. But this time Ireland decided not to go wide. Instead, Devin Toner collected the ball and simply handed it on to Sean O'Brien. In fairness, the ruse was beautifully disguised for it fooled half the Scottish pack. O'Brien thundered on, swept past Dougie Fife, and Ireland had another try.

To their credit, Scotland reacted with the same feisty spirit that has characterised all their performances this season. They came back strongly and pretty much owned the second quarter. Their reward came on the half-hour when Finn Russell, following up a break by Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg, went over in the left corner for his first international try, and Ireland were riding their luck a few minutes later when Hogg went through, too, only to be called back for a dubious knock-on decision.
The fightback gave heart to the Scottish fans - a distinct minority if the volume levels were any sort of guide - but it was a brief affair. Scotland kept the play deep in Ireland's territory until half-time, but the scoreboard was not for budging. Even then, there was a suspicion that the Scots had shot their bolt.

It was more than a suspicion after the break. If Ireland had looked directionless in the final stages of the first half, they glistened with renewed purpose in the opening passages of the second. Sexton added a quick penalty, his third of the game, but it was a wonder that it took Ireland fully 10 minutes to get their third try.
This time it was delivered by centre Jared Payne. Again, lineout possession was the basis of it, with Ireland rumbling forward from 15 metres out. A few phases later, the ball was spun out to Sexton, who provided a delicious reverse pass for Payne to spear through between the posts.

Sexton's conversion took the score to 10-30. A few minutes later, the fly-half added another three points with a penalty and Ireland were in a title-winning position. They strengthened their fortress with O'Brien's second try, eight minutes from the end, with yet another combination of clean lineout possession and efficient recycling through the phases.
Yet Ireland's determination at the other end said almost as much about them. In Scotland's final rally, Hogg squeezed over int he right corner, only to be denied by Jamie Heaslip slapping rhe ball from his hand. "That was an incredible piece of skill," said O'Connell of that moment. And, as it turned out, a very significant piece as well.
