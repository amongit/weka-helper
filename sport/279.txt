Luis Suarez was at the centre of a fresh biting controversy following Barcelona's 2-1 Champions League last 16 first leg against Manchester City.
Twitter went into overdrive with a number of fans questioning whether Suarez had 'nibbled' on City defender Martin Demichelis.
At first look, the images of Suarez moving his head down to Demichelis's outstretched right arm were inconclusive...

...but then fresh evidence emerged showing that, on this occasion, Suarez was in the clear.

Luis Suarez vs Demichelis
While there had been suggestions Suarez was up to his old tricks again, neither Demichelis or City raised any issues at the time.
A City spokesman said: "The incident was not discussed by Demichelis or anyone else at City after the game, indicating the defender had no sense of grievance."
Of course Suarez has history. In November 2010, while playing for Ajax, he chomped down on Otman Bakkal's shoulder.
Then, in 2013, having joined Liverpool for Â£22m, he bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.
But he saved the most infamous for last after sinking his teeth into Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's final World Cup group game. The third bite earned him a nine-game ban from world football.
