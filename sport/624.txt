Australia v Pakistan, Cricket World Cup quarter-final: as it happened
By Ben Bloom
10:45AM GMT 20 Mar 2015
• Australia score 214/6 to win by six wickets • Smith and Watson hit half-centuries • Wahab takes two wickets and has two catches dropped off his bowling • Pakistan bowled out for 213; Sohail top scores with 41 • All 10 Pakistan wickets caught; Hazlewood takes 4-35 • Pakistan win toss and bat first • Kevin Pietersen and ECB ready to call a truce • Brilliant Brendon McCullum leads NZ to brink of history

10.45 With that I shall bid you farewell. Not as one-sided as the first two quarter-finals but we still await a knockout nailbiter. Poor Wahab Riaz, who produced a stunning spell of fearsome pace bowling today but was not given much support from his team-mates. That no Pakistan batsman scored above 41 shows how poorly they batted while credit must go to Steve Smith for his composed knock that set up victory for the Aussies. The hosts now advance to face India in the semi-finals while New Zealand play West Indies tomorrow for the chance to meet South Africa in the last four. Thanks for joining. Cheerio.
<noframe>Twitter: Kung Fu Panda - If there was justice in the world, Wahab Riaz's figures wouldn't have been 9-0-54-2. It would've been 9-0-24-5. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23AUSvsPAK" target="_blank">#AUSvsPAK</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23CWC15" target="_blank">#CWC15</a></noframe>
10.38 The scorebook will forever record a six-wicket victory for Australia but it was a lot closer than that lone statistic suggests. If Watson had been caught early on in his innings the home side would have been in real trouble at 80/4. Despite some quite brilliant fast bowling from Wahab the left-hander could not do it alone and Pakistan did not do enough to win.
OVER 33.5: AUS 216/4 (Watson 64* Maxwell 44*) Sohail Khan returns, Maxwell steps outside leg to give himself room and kabooms the ball miles over the cover point boundary for a big six. Three runs needed for victory and Watson finishes it with a cover drive for four. Australia win by six wickets.
OVER 33: AUS 203/4 (Watson 60* Maxwell 35*) The Aussies are in a hurry now. This time it is Watson's turn to finally pick up a Wahab bouncer and he middles it over square leg for six. A tickle off his hip brings Watson four more. Wahab won't stop though, digging in a cracking bumper which misses Watson's face by centimetres. He then unleashes a torrent of verbals, Watson stands still and grins a smile of victory and the umpires have some stern words. All good fun.
OVER 32: AUS 193/4 (Watson 50* Maxwell 35*) A single brings up an unlikely Watson half-century. He's fortunate to be out there after his working over by Wahad a bit earlier but he has played some lovely shots today. Maxwell is mixing solid defence with almighty heaves and latches onto a full, wide Ehsan delivery, creaming it over cover for four before going exactly two runs better by pulling for six over wide fine-leg. This is almost over.
OVER 31: AUS 182/4 (Watson 49* Maxwell 25*) Wow. First up Maxwell flicks the ball off his toes for four through the leg side. He then backs away to leg, Wahab follows him and Maxwell plays what can only (poorly) be described as a closed eyes, walkaway, cut shot for four. I'm not sure he had any idea where the ball would end up but it's effective.
OVER 30: AUS 169/4 (Watson 48* Maxwell 14*) Is there one final twist in this match? Can anyone give Wahab some support? Not Ehsan in this over it seems, who has just seen his delivery pulled by Maxwell for to the wide mid-on boundary. And Watson finishes the over with a perfectly timed cover drive for another four.
<noframe>Twitter: OptaJim - 6 - Wahab Riaz has now had the joint-most catches dropped off his bowling at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23CWC15" target="_blank">#CWC15</a> - six, with Suranga Lakmal. Spills. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23AUSvPAK" target="_blank">#AUSvPAK</a></noframe>
OVER 29: AUS 160/4 (Watson 45* Maxwell 8*) Right on cue here is Wahab. And Maxwell is dropped! Wahab bangs one in short, Maxwell closes his eyes and attempts what can only be described as an upper pull which goes straight up into the air only for Sohail Khan to shell the chance running in at third man. That was truly one of the worst cricket shots you will ever see. Maxwell was completely and utterly clueless. What more can Wahab do??? Time for some more drinks.
OVER 28: AUS 153/4 (Watson 42* Maxwell 5*) Afridi is also off and Rahat will try his luck. I'm not sure why Wahab hasn't been given another chance after his breather. Surely it's time for Pakistan to roll the dice. Maxwell wangs the ball full and wide outside off stump, there is a big appeal as the ball goes through to the keeper but the umpire is unmoved because Maxwell hit ground rather than ball. Five dot balls are ruined by a lovely straight drive for four to end the over.
Not a great deal of sympathy from the home supporters for Rahat's earlier drop of Watson:

OVER 27: AUS 149/4 (Watson 42* Maxwell 1*) You have to think this match has almost gone from Pakistan now. It would take something spectacular to win it from here. Ehsan is thrown the ball again to bring an end to the spin experiment. And he has the breakthrough!!! A glimmer of hope remains. There are two slips in for new man Maxwell. Replays show that lbw was only just clipping leg stump but the decision would have stayed with the onfield umpire so Smith would have been sent on his way with a referral.
Smith lbw Ehsan 65 Full, straight and Smith misses it attempting to flick the ball into the leg side. There is no review after Finch wasted it so Smith has to go. FOW 148/4
OVER 26: AUS 146/3 (Smith 63* Watson 41*) Here comes Smithy. The main man skips down the track and lifts Afridi for a one-bounce four over wide mid-on. A wonderful shot that required so little exertion.
OVER 25: AUS 139/3 (Smith 57* Watson 41*) Four singles from an unproblematic Haris Sohail over.
OVER 24: AUS 135/3 (Smith 55* Watson 39*) There's a big meeting to decide who should bowl the next over and Afridi is the chosen man. There's not a lot happening for these spinners at the moment. Watson pulls straight back past the bowler for three and the singles keep on coming. Nine runs off the over.
OVER 23: AUS 126/3 (Smith 53* Watson 32*) It is time for a bit of spin again courtesy of Haris Sohail. Just the three singles off the over but wickets are desperately needed now.
OVER 22: AUS 123/3 (Smith 52* Watson 30*) Wahab is a superb exponent of the bouncer. Sohail Khan is not. He tries to copy his quicker team-mate but Watson latches onto it and pulls hard and fast for four. He goes short again and it's called wide. He then goes short again and it's called wide. Oh dear it's all going wrong. Meanwhile Shane Warne says that Wahab spell was "One of the best spells of fast bowling I've seen in a long time". Back to Sohail Khan and his woeful short bowling: this time Watson swivels with ease to turn another half-tracker to the square leg boundary. Eleven runs off the over.
OVER 21: AUS 112/3 (Smith 52* Watson 21*) Here is Rahat - he of dropping Watson fame. Can he make amends? No he can't. Full and wide outside off and Smith helps himself to another cover drive four to bring up his half-century off 51 balls. Amid all the excitement Smith has played beautifully. It's like he's playing in a different match to every other batsman on either side.
OVER 20: AUS 106/3 (Smith 48* Watson 20*) Sohail Khan has not managed to back up the bowling of Wahab at the other end and Watson pushes the ball off the back foot for four bring up the Australia 100. Have the hosts ridden the storm?
OVER 19: AUS 98/3 (Smith 47* Watson 13*) Wahab continues and, much to every neutral's joy, Smith takes a single off the first ball. Another inch-perfect short delivery sees the ball aimed at Watson's throat before thudding into Watson's glove and fortunately fall safe. Another man comes in under the helmet to double the number of fielders close in on the leg side. This is compelling viewing. But are Wahab's powers just starting to wane? The umpire signals a couple of wides and the seamer is starting to look a bit tired. Oddly there are now no fielders short in on the leg side and Watson tucks the ball off his hips for two. And the over (and I suspect his quite brilliant spell) is complete.
OVER 18: AUS 93/3 (Smith 46* Watson 11*) Afridi is off and Sohail Khan is back. The tall right hander tries to emulate Wahab's tactic but strays outside off and Watson helps himself to a boundary by pulling the ball through mid-wicket.
This picture neatly sums up Wahab v Watson:

OVER 17: AUS 86/3 (Smith 45* Watson 5*) Oh what has Rahat done????? Wahab bangs one in, Watson finally decides to try out his hook shot but top edges it straight down to fine leg. He has to catch it. It is right down his throat. There is nothing else for it. But Rahat DROPS IT!!! An absolute sitter and Wahab is apoplectic. After all that hard work Watson is dropped and he is now at the non-striker's end. Not for long though. He's back at the danger end with two balls to face. Bang, aimed at the face, defended dead in front of him. Wahab goads Watson by telling him to try the hook again. One ball to go, but it's not short enough and Watson tucks it away for two. And breathe.
OVER 16: AUS 83/3 (Smith 44* Watson 4*) Meanwhile Smith is staying away from the fuss at the other end, instead taking a step down the track and whipping Afridi for a glorious four through mid-wicket. A good over for Australia brings nine runs. Watson is on strike to face Wahab though...
<noframe>Twitter: Pavilion Opinions - Stunning from Wahab, who's bowling like a grouchy tornado irritated the eclipse is getting all the attention. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23AUSvPAK" target="_blank">#AUSvPAK</a></noframe>
OVER 15: AUS 74/3 (Smith 36* Watson 3*) Right then, nicely hydrated it is time to continue Wahab v Watson. Unsurprisingly the left armer isn't changing a thing, wanging the ball repeatedly in around the chest area and causing Watson to first fend the ball into the off side, then fend it just short of mid-wicket and then fend it over the slip cordon but maringally short of third man. This is thrilling cricket. Wahab is giving Watson a proper working over here and the batsman is merely trying to survive. "The best four over spell of the tournament," says Mr Commentator.
OVER 14: AUS 72/3 (Smith 35* Watson 2*) Interesting move here from Misbah who throws the ball to Afridi. The leggie has dismissed Watson three times in ODIs so there is history there. The short-leg comes in but Watson responds by rocking back and pulling hard and straight of that man. And that's drinks.
OVER 13: AUS 67/3 (Smith 31* Watson 1*) Wahab has his tail up and is bowling with good pace here. Another bouncer whistles past Watson's nose with a cracking follow through and patronising clap from the bowler. This is turning into a great battle between Wahab and Watson. The short mid-wicket is in again in case Watson fends one into the air but he just about survives the over.
<noframe>Twitter: King Cricket - Shane Watson looks like he's about to cry at the best of times. Not sure how he's going to cope with actual bullying.</noframe>

OVER 12: AUS 66/3 (Smith 30* Watson 1*) This is all getting gloriously tasty in Adelaide and now the crowd are getting involved, jeering and cheering the exchange of words that are following almost every delivery. Smith rises above the din though and eases into yet another sublime cover drive for four.
OVER 11: AUS 59/3 (Smith 24* Watson 0*) And another one bites the dust! This time it is skipper Clarke to depart. Watson is the new man and Wahab is seriously pumped up here. He wangs the ball in short at Watson's head, the Aussie ducks under it and the bowler's follow through takes him all the way past the batsman. Great stuff, plenty of stares and a few choice words.
Clarke c Maqsood b Wahab 24 Great stuff from Pakistan as Clarke falls hook, line and sinker into the trap. Wahab digs one in short and Clarke fends it off his ribcage straight into the hands of Maqsood at very short mid-wicket who can't believe his luck. FOW 59/3
OVER 10: AUS 56/2 (Smith 22* Clarke 7*) So Pakistan have the early wickets they craved but the scoreboard continues to tick along pleasantly enough with Clarke chopping a couple down to third man.
OVER 9: AUS 52/2 (Smith 22* Clarke 3*) Wahab is the new bowler but Warner tucks into more width and cuts the ball inches from the boundary rope squashy triangular border to pick up three runs. He won't do so again though because he's walking back to the changing room!
Warner c Rahat b Wahab 24 Warner has given his wicket away. The Aussie opener has been tucking into any width and attempts to helps this short, wide delivery on its way. He lifts it over the slip cordon but straight to Rahat at third man who holds on to a good catch low in front of him. FOW 49/2
OVER 8: AUS 44/1 (Warner 21* Smith 21*) Can Pakistan and Rahat put any sort of squeeze on the Aussie batsmen? Smith picks up a couple off his legs and then a couple more off the back foot past mid-off. All rather easy.
OVER 7: AUS 40/1 (Warner 21* Smith 17*) Oh wow. That cover drive of the last over is repeated in near-identical fashion by Smith for exactly the same result. Michael Vaughan eat your heart out.
OVER 6: AUS 35/1 (Warner 21* Smith 11*) Short and wide from new man Rahat and Warner just biffs it over wide mid-off for four. It's hard to describe a shot like that. It was almost an uppercut over the infield. Smith then gets in on the act with a textbook cover drive for a boundary of his own. That was straight out of the MCC coaching manual. Two shots from complete opposite ends of the batting spectrum yet both brilliant in their own way.
OVER 5: AUS 23/1 (Warner 16* Smith 5*) Smith is susceptible to the straight delivery but get it too straight (and by too straight I mean on leg stump) and he can whip it with ease. Sohail Khan does just that and Smith flicks the ball for four through square-leg.
OVER 4: AUS 17/1 (Warner 15* Smith 0*) So do we have a game on our hands? Another quick wicket or two would make things very interesting. Warner isn't going to stop and continues on his merry way by easing the ball between point and cover for two.
<noframe>Twitter: Andy Zaltzman - Finch lbw. He refers it... one of the worst referrals ever. Unless he thought it was the 18th century &amp; middle stumps hadn't been invented.</noframe>
OVER 3: AUS 15/1 (Warner 13* Smith 0*) This is a good Adelaide pitch. Finch rides a good length ball outside off and creams it on the up through the covers for two. Pakistan's total is rapidly being made to look insufficient... haha and right on cue there is the wicket! That was a really rubbish referral. Surely Warner has to tell him not to bother.
Finch lbw Sohail Khan 2 It's pretty full, it's very straight and Finch swings across the line only for the ball to thud into his front pad. The umpire's finger goes up but for some terrible reason Finch decides to waste the Aussies' only review. That was dead straight, knocking out all three poles. Game on? FOW 15/1
OVER 2: AUS 13/0 (Warner 13* Finch 0*) Ehsan will kick things off from the other end... but he's too full, too wide and Warner slashes the ball over second slip for four to take his tally to 13 runs off seven balls.
OVER 1: AUS 7/0 (Warner 7* Finch 0*) Sohail Khan has the new ball in hand. I can't imagine Warner will take his time looking to chase down this total. Oh and that is a supremely timed forward defence to get off the mark with a boundary! It was nothing more than a push but the ball had flown off the bat. He is quite some batsman. I am rather taken by him as a batsman. Not as a man. I'm not very fond of him as a man. Another push for three follows before a big shout for lbw off Finch's first ball which the umpire waves away. It was very straight but slightly too high.
7.44 Here come the players. There is a bit of history when a team scores 213 in a World Cup knockout match. Remember this?

7.16 As I mentioned a bit earlier, Pakistan's bowling is their strongest suit but it will be quite some achievement if they can haul their underperforming batsmen out of trouble here. A top score of 41 says it all really because this pitch has very few, if any, demons. I'll be back with the run chase in a bit.

7.05 So there you have it. Pakistan will have to defend a measly total of 213 with no batsman coming close to scoring a half-century. Hazlewood leads the Aussies off the field after his four wickets for 35 runs.
OVER 49.5: PAK 213 (Rahat 6*) Faulkner will finish things off with the final over but Ehsan finally connects with a swing and biffs the ball back over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four. These two batsmen haven't done overly badly here. Ehsan tries to repeat the feat, doesn't quite get hold of it but picks up a couple more with the ball landing short of the boundary rope. One more big swing though and he's gone...
Ehsan c Starc b Faulkner 15 A huge swing sails to Starc who dives forward and takes a very good catch at fine leg. FOW 213/10
OVER 49: PAK 206/9 (Ehsan 9* Rahat 5*) Swing and miss. Swing and miss. Swing and miss. Repeat to fade. Or until an inside edge brings a single off the final delivery of Watson's over.
Starc tops the tournament wicket tally with 18 so far...
<noframe>Twitter: Andy Zaltzman - Mitchell Starc's tournament average, strike rate and economy have taken a battering today. He finishes with 2 for 40 off 10.</noframe>
OVER 48: PAK 205/9 (Ehsan 9* Rahat 4*) Faulkner to continue and Ehsan is in staunch defence mode before handing over to Rahat who attempts an almighty baseball swing of a heave, failing to get within about a metre of the ball. He repeats the tricks, gets a thick outside edge and sees the ball fall safe over cover's head for a single. Can't blame him for having a swing now.
OVER 47: PAK 203/9 (Ehsan 8* Rahat 3*) My mistake, Hazlewood had completed his 10 overs. As have Starc and Johnson which means Watson is thrown the ball now. Pakistan's bowling is undoubtedly better than their batting but they will do well to defend this total. Three singles are added to the score.
OVER 46: PAK 200/9 (Ehsan 6* Rahat 2*) Hazlewood, one wicket away from a five-for, is taken off in place of Faulkner. Ehsan and Rahat are serious tailenders with just 13 ODI runs between them going into this game. Eshan nudges a quick couple off his hips before a single brings up the Pakistan 200.
OVER 45: PAK 196/9 (Ehsan 3* Rahat 1*) Surely, surely, surely Pakistan will just attempt to survive now. Starc has a third wicket in his sights and kicks things off with yorker, bouncer, full toss. An outside edge runs down to third man for a single before a second edge flies to Clarke at second slip who grabs it superbly but the ball bounced about two inches in front of him. Nice to see a slip fielder not trying to claim a catch when they know it hasn't carried.
OVER 44: PAK 195/9 (Ehsan 3*) Pakistan are now in a position where they cannot afford to take many risks. Instead this will just be trying to survive and nurdle. Ehsan works Hazlewood for two to long leg and ... oh why did I bother even writing those first two sentences? Sohail is out from the last ball and stupid doesn't come close to describing his shot. When Pakistan are good they are very good. But when they are bad they appear utterly braindead.
Wahab c Haddin b Hazlewood 4 Idiocy. An almighty heave sees the ball soar a mile into the sky and straight into Haddin's hands for the easiest of catches. FOW 195/9
OVER 43: PAK 192/8 (Ehsan 0* Sohail 4*) Well Pakistan are really up agaist it now. Hazlewood has just removed Maqsood who became the fifth batsman to fall between 20 and 41. Starc now has ball in hand and he has his tail up for what is turning out to be a tasty battle with Wahab. And he's got his man second ball! Big smile from Starc who all too easily out-thought the batsman there. Pakistan are deep into what is a very weak tail here. Any runs from here on in are a bonus.
Wahab c Haddin b Starc 16 That is brainless from the Pakistan batsman. I know we are in the final few overs but they are now in real danger of being bowled out. Down the track comes Wahab, aims a huge heave in the direction of the clouds and feathers a thin edge through to the keeper. Stupid. FOW 188/8
06.30 Good morning to those in the UK and good afternoon to those of you over Australia way. We join this quarter-final in the closing stages of a pretty average batting performance from Pakistan.
The headlines are: - Pakistan chose to bat first - They lost two wickets in the first six overs - Captain Misbah-ul-Haq was bowled, the bail lit up but it was not dislodged and he was able to continue - Pakistan have lost wickets at regular intervals - Australia have shared their wickets around. Josh Hazlewood and Glenn Maxwell have two apiece
