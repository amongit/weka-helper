Jack Wilshere is out of England’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania and their friendly with Italy, according to his manager Arsène Wenger. The midfielder’s minor ankle surgery at the end of February was originally scheduled to put him out for “days, not weeks”, but despite the fact that England do not play Lithuania and Italy until the end of March, Wenger has confirmed that he will not be ready in time.

“He will not be fit,” Wenger said. “We are March 13. In 17 days I don’t think he will be available to play an international game. I don’t know how long it will be before he returns because we have to respect the progression of his training.”
Wenger has not spoken to Roy Hodgson about Wilshere yet, but you suspect the England manager will find out soon enough. Since the World Cup debacle, Hodgson has built the England side around Wilshere playing at the base of a midfield diamond. He has started all six of England’s game since the World Cup. England have not lost a competitive game when he has started. It is a bigger blow to Hodgson than many will realise.

So when will Wilshere be back? Nobody quite knows. “It’s very difficult to give you a day today,” Wenger admitted. “I don’t know. I’m hopeful it’s a matter of weeks now. We had to rest him anyway, so we decided to get these screws off [his ankle] instead of doing it at the end of the season. It’s taken a bit longer and I don’t really know why at the moment.”

Wenger also confirmed what we already suspected, that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s grade-1 hamstring tear – “a classic hamstring”, as Wenger put it – will also put him out of England duty. He will be out for “three weeks, four weeks maximum”, according to Wenger. Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered the injury during the FA Cup at Old Trafford on Monday night.
