Mohamed Sanu To Bengals In 3rd Round After NFL Draft Prank
CINCINNATI (AP) â€” The Bengals got a receiver with their first pick in the third round of the draft, taking Rutgers' Mohamed Sanu.

Sanu thought the Bengals had drafted him in the first round on Thursday night, when Cincinnati was getting ready to make the 27th pick and someone called his phone and said they were from the Bengals. It was someone playing a prank.

This time, it was for real.

Cincinnati opened the day by taking Penn State defensive tackle Devon Still in the second round, hoping to add to their depth on the line.

The Bengals had two picks in the first round. They took Alabama cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick with the 17th overall pick and Wisconsin guard Kevin Zeitler with the 27th pick.
