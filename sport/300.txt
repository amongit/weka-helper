Serbia 2 Scotland 0: match report

The dreaded prospect of a first qualifying campaign without a single win is looming over Scotland after their latest setback, inflicted by Serbia on a sparsely attended and bitterly cold evening.
Gordon Strachan, bold in deployment of essentially experimental teams in his first competitive games in charge, has been rewarded by two defeats.
The two second-half goals in quick succession from Filip Djuricic mean that failing to reach the World Cup finals in Brazil next summer is the least of Strachan’s concerns.
If this squad are to avoid an ignominious place in the record books, they will have to conjure a win from their four remaining games in Group A – against the two top teams, at home to Belgium and away to Croatia, or from another trip to the Balkans to face Macedonia.
“I said we might have to take a few slaps but we have to do something, we can’t keep plodding along and hoping something happens,” said a defiant Strachan. “I want to pick players that will make things happen.”

Against Wales at Hampden, he had chosen a midfield quartet who had never played alongside one another and last night he did it again, this time with the twist of fielding two debutants – George Boyd of Hull and Brighton’s Liam Bridcutt.
The new boys took their place alongside James McArthur in midfield, while Jordan Rhodes got his first competitive start, supported by Steven Naismith and Shaun Maloney.
Novi Sad woke to a blizzard, which was still persisting at lunchtime, by which stage the playing surface was covered with five inches of snow. The Scottish Football Association put contingency arrangements in place for the squad and travelling party to retain their hotel rooms in Belgrade, in anticipation of a postponement to 3pm today.
As the Serbians toiled to clear the field, they were joined by Scotland fans who worked with admirable will, with techniques that included rolling giant snowballs to plough through the covering.
By late afternoon the snowfall had turned to rain, a change that guaranteed that the game would go ahead, but with the consequence that the pitch was a gluepot.
It was Scotland who found themselves mired in their own half for the first quarter of a contest which, under the circumstances, was surprisingly entertaining and played at a brisk tempo.
As Wales had done at Hampden, Serbia took the game to Scotland from the start and the Scottish defence was probed and penetrated repeatedly by Djuricic, his forward partner, Dusan Tadic, and the dangerously fast and skilful Dusan Basta, wide on the right.
Of the six changes made by Strachan, two were at the back – Gordon Marshall for Allan McGregor and Steven Whittaker for Charlie Mulgrew – but the defenders held out and provided a platform for McArthur, Bridcutt and Boyd to settle into the contest.
The Scots, though, did not create a single real chance before the break and were undone after an hour when Zoran Tosic was allowed an unchallenged cross into the box where Ljubomir Fejsa had an attempt blocked before Djuricic spun the rebound beyond Marshall.
If Strachan could only be uneasy at how cheaply the goal was sold, there was worse to come. Rhodes, who had little joy in attack, planted a shot into the arms of Vladimir Stojkovic. Serbia mounted a counter-attack but it looked spent when the ball arrived with Gary Caldwell.
The Scottish captain had options, but his attempted clearance fell between Alan Hutton and Nenad Tomovic. The Serb reacted first and bore into the box to prompt Djuricic. His first attempt was blocked but the striker finished the rebound.
