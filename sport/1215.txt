Commonwealth Games 2014: Rod Stewart rocked it

Rod Stewart rocked Hampden Park last night, delivering a breezy master class in charisma, soul and sheer vocal magic. At 69-years-old, he’s still got the pipes, as they say. The Commonwealth Games may not have had a budget to match the Olympics but at least they found a vintage rocker for the opening ceremony who can still sing. It invited invidious comparison with Paul McCartney in London 2012, when the veteran superstar fluffed the intro to one of his most well-loved ballads, then croaked it in a thin, tremulous voice stretched over a rack of high notes. The then 70-year-old McCartney was drowned out by a joyous singalong in the Olympic Park, but TV was less forgiving, and I suspect there were more than a few viewers thinking, let it be, Paul, just let it be.
Elton John received criticism in the same summer season for croaking through the Queen’s Jubilee concert, although he later blamed it on that most pernicious of vocal villains, the common cold. Still touring vigorously at 67, Elton’s voice is noticeably deeper and growlier than ever before and he’s long since lost the burning falsetto that used to adorn songs like Rocket Man. Nonetheless Elton insists he’s singing better than ever, and vast audiences still pack stadiums to hear him.

With recorded music sales flagging, live performance has become even more significant to a musician’s earnings, and veteran performers remain huge attractions. Fans are drawn by iconic reputations, the older generation evoking nostalgia for their own lost youths whilst younger generations come to see what all the fuss was about. As my son said when surprising me with a request to join me at a Bob Dylan concert: “he’s very old. He might die before I get to see him.” Of course Dylan was never much of a singer, which might explain why no one really seems to mind now that his live voice is pitched somewhere between a growl and a bark, rendering his lyrics completely indistinguishable, with the audience filling in the blanks.
Voices change with age. For male singers, timbres coarsen and deepen, high notes disappear, and you can lose control of your vibrato, the ability to make notes fluctuate. “Time takes its toll,” as Tom Jones once admitted to me. He has gone from a tenor to a baritone over the course his career, and at 74 compensates by dropping the keys of his songs and expressing himself more in the richness of his low range. Jones is still a belter but as rock and roll enters its dotage, which oldies should confine their singing to the shower?

The Who have recently announced a final tour, although 70-year-old Roger Daltrey sounds like he blew several gaskets many years ago. His voice too is deep and hoarse now, though he employed its bluesy rawness to excellent effect this year on an album with Wilko Johnson. Ultimately it is all about how you utilise the changes in your vocal instrument. McCartney refuses to bring down the key of his songs, compensating live by banking up harmonies around his lead vocal. Mick Jagger, still touring with the Rolling Stones at 70, was never really much of a singer in the first place, but has incredible vocal presence and character which is undiminished.

At 65, Robert Plant declines to reunite Led Zeppelin because he doesn’t think he has the vocal energy to perform heavy rock songs night after night. As his solo shows attest, Plant can still unleash terrifying blues wails but these days he sings with more nuance and less sheer power. Neil Young’s voice was always high and thin, and anyway, he can preserve it by spending most of his set playing long, howling guitar solos.
It tends to be at the softer end of the spectrum that voices are least diminished. Paul Simon and Cliff Richard still sound soft and sweet, and if you closed your eyes you could be listening to their younger selves, but they never had to compete with heavy drums and roaring guitars. Rod Stewart, on the other hand, was frontman for The Faces, one of the most raucous bands in rock history. With his throaty rasp, his voice always sounded like it had been through the mill, the result of too many late nights, hard drinking and debauched behaviour. Perhaps that is his real secret: Stewart always sounded old before his time. Perhaps it has taken him this long to really grow into his voice.
