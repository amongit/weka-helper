Carmelo Anthony U.S. Olympic Record: U.S. Star Surpasses Stephon Marbury With 37 Points
LONDON -- Carmelo Anthony has broken the U.S. record for points in an Olympic game, scoring 37 through the middle of the third quarter against Nigeria.
Anthony shattered the record of 31 points set by Stephon Marbury in the 2004 Olympics.
Anthony made 10 of his first 12 3-point shots Thursday night in just 14 1/2 minutes and was just one point shy of the overall U.S. record for points in an international event, the 38 points scored by Kevin Durant in the semifinals of the 2010 world basketball championship.
The U.S. also broke its record for 3-pointers made in game with 14 in the first half.
