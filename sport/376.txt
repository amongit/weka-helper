Dyson: Olympics ceremony 'nearly made me smash my TV'

Danny Boyle’s portrayal of the industrial revolution in his celebrated opening ceremony for the London Olympics prompted Sir James Dyson to nearly “smash in” his television, the inventor has revealed.
The vacuum manufacturer said he was “upset” by the 2012 spectacle, which he suggested disparaged the industrialisation of Britain.
Boyle wowed the world when he and his team transformed a green and pastoral land into pandemonium – with a smoke and flame-filled vision of industrial Britain during a 14 minute sequence on stage.
His production, which was watched by more than a billion television viewers around the globe, marked important moments in the nation’s history, including the inception of the NHS.
An eruption of half a dozen dark satanic mills, sprouting up from the stage floor, marked the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the late 18th Century.

But Sir James was not impressed by the ceremony.
“That really upset me. I nearly smashed in the television,” he told The Times Magazine.
“This wonderful green garden of England wrecked by satanic mills and women with big hammers. That cultural idea is very hard to undo, but it’s inexplicable because the industrial revolution brought people out of poverty and created enormous wealth.”
Boyle, who directed the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, said at the time that his goal was to create “a picture of ourselves as a nation” in the ceremony.
Meanwhile, Sir James, who made his fortune through the bagless vacuum cleaner and is said to own more land in England than the Queen, lamented the fact that Britain does not produce enough engineers, saying there was currently a shortage of 60,000.
“In our schools and in our culture, engineers are not people who are revered in any way,” he said.
“It’s not a profession that many people aspire to. And neither is manufacturing, which is beyond the pale.
“This is because the industrial revolution wasn’t created by aristocrats. It was created by the lower middle class and the middle class. And the British people aspire to whatever aristocrats want.”
