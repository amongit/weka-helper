Bath lock Stuart Hooper is a captain for all seasons

Fame does not settle readily on the shoulders of Stuart Hooper. The Bath lock does not attract the spotlight, does not incite media frenzies in the manner of team-mates such as Sam Burgess or George Ford or Kyle Eastmond, does not have to fight his way through a throng of autograph hunters, but for his head coach, Mike Ford, he is “the most important man at the club”.
He has been captain for four seasons. He is held in the highest esteem by his peers, is mentored on leadership by his former coach at Leeds, Stuart Lancaster, is unsung and unassuming, yet Ford brackets him with icons of the modern game, Keith Wood, Brian O’Driscoll and Martin Johnson, as “the best captain I’ve seen at work”.
These accolades hold little sway with the player himself: modest, down-to-earth, selfless. He is a star without ego. Without Hooper’s influence, it is not fanciful to imagine that last Sunday’s epoch-defining 35-18 win in Toulouse would not have happened.
While the jazzy, jagging antics of backs such as Jonathan Joseph, Kyle Eastmond and Matt Banahan, drew rave notices, the tone was set by a man who was only on the bench that day. A few hours before kick-off, Bath assembled at their hotel in Toulouse. Normally the head coach gathers the team together for their final pep talk, those edgy, slow-moving mood-setting moments that are always difficult to fill.
You can never win a game at that time but you can go some way towards losing one if the wrong things are said. The importance of the fixture was obvious. Bath had been beaten in their two opening matches in the European Champions Cup, losing at home to Toulouse after being thumped in Glasgow. Another defeat and Europe was over. No team have ever gone through to the knockout stages after losing their first two matches. The scene needed to be set. And Ford gave the job to Hooper.

“It is usually me, pulling everything together and putting over the key messages, but I just knew that Stuart would be brilliant at doing it, drawing the right pictures,” Ford said. “You forget what it is like to be in the middle of a huddle, what it is like to be in the middle of a ruck, or a scrum, and you need to capture that essence. The game plan was one word: tempo. From prop to full-back, Stuart nailed it. Everyone was on-message. And he ended by saying that this match was about creating memories that would last forever. The hairs were up on the back of my neck listening.”
Hooper will lead Bath into Sunday’s final pool match against Glasgow with the team looking to sign off with a flourish. The 33-year-old, who began his career at Saracens in the late nineties, and captained them as an 18-year-old in the days of former Wallaby centre Tim Horan and French lock Abdel Benazzi, has to ensure that his men do not believe that Sunday’s coup de grâce at the Stade Ernest Wallon was an end in itself. They have to repeat the feat against a side who beat them 37-10 in the first round of matches in October. It is no gimme.
Hooper will begin his match-day preparations with an evocative drive down Bathwick Hill towards the city. “And the Rec will be there right at the heart of it all, as if the energy of the entire city is flooding towards that point,” said Hooper, who moved to Bath from Leeds in 2008.
“It is a special place. It always has been for me as a Devon lad [from Cheriton Fitzpaine], and I was aware of the history of the place and what rugby meant to the people. Getting that connection back, that link between team and fans, has been critical for us.
“We have not stumbled to this point and just put a few results and performances together. It has been well thought-out. It is about winning, of course, but it is always about doing things properly.”
That has not always been the Bath way over the past decade, the team embroiled in a drug-related scandal in 2009 that saw three players banned and the club rocked to the core. The makeover is not yet complete but is very much under way. One thing is missing – a major trophy. Hooper is coming towards the end of his time, although talks are continuing about an extension to his contract.
“As a player, I will be judged on whether we win trophies, but as a Bath captain, I’d like to think I’d be judged on what is left behind,” Hooper said. “I get more pleasure from seeing the young lads come in and perform than anything I might do. I’m so proud of the way they have progressed. Just see how Kyle now addresses the group compared to when he first arrived here. You’ve got to be careful about sounding a bit precious, but this is more than a job to me, more than just a professional contract with a club. It is a huge part of my life.”
And will probably remain so, with Hooper’s wife expecting their fourth child and father already a regular fixture at mini-rugby and football in every Sunday with his three sons.
Ford senior speaks highly of his captain’s ability “to computerise” a match, to see tactically where the next plays should be and to articulate it. Ford wants to develop on-field leaders to cut out coaches such as himself sending on messages. Player-led rugby has Hooper at its centre, prompting and involving.
All of which begs the question as to why he has not achieved more in the international arena, getting only as far as the Saxons under Lancaster. Nick Easter has been recalled at 36. Not too late, surely?
“It does feel now as if international rugby is not going to happen for me, and I am comfortable with that,” Hooper said. “I would not have said that two years ago. But the age and quality of these guys in the second row, well, let us say my aspirations are rooted here at Bath now.
“For me, this is one of the most amazing places in the world to play rugby. There is a sense of pride, as well as responsibility, in me to do the club justice every time I drive down Bathwick Hill.” Sunday will be no different.
