Colts agree to terms with LB Nate Irving
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts said Friday they have agreed to terms with unrestricted free agent linebacker Nate Irving.
Irving spent the past four seasons with the Denver Broncos, where he had 104 tackles, two sacks and 22 special teams stops in 54 regular season games, including 12 starts. In six playoff games, he added nine more tackles.
Irving started the first eight games last season and posted a career-high 44 tackles along with a sack before being placed on injured reserve Nov. 13.
Irving was a third-round draft pick by Denver in 2011 out of North Carolina State.
