Match of the Day pundit Kevin Kilbane ribbed by pupils after filming slip-up
Match of the Day pundit Kevin Kilbane has made a smooth transition to life in the media after bringing his lengthy playing career, which included spells with Sunderland, West Brom, Everton and Wigan, to a close.
Nicknamed Zinedine Kilbane by Republic of Ireland fans, the 38-year-old won 110 caps for the national side and played at the 2002 World Cup finals.
But his playing achievements and subsequent broadcasting career counted for little when he slipped up while working with BBC News School Reporters Ben and Sam from The Lancasterian School, a Special Educational Needs school in Manchester.
You can watch the full report and read Kevin's thoughts on the experience on School Report's News Day on Thursday, when thousands of pupils around the UK will be turning their classroom into newsrooms.
