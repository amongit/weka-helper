- Qatar 2022 World Cup final may take place on Dec 23

10.52 Discussions over Fifa's recommendations will continue until a final call is made on March 19 but it's time to wrap things up for the time being. I leave you with Stoke chairman Peter Coates's thoughts on a Christmas World Cup.
It’s a disaster and everyone knows it. It will come down to how we manage it, which we will do with great difficulty.

English game is rich enough to absorb this disruption
Fifa recommends winter World Cup for Qatar
Top clubs demand compensation for World Cup move
"We would have to get the changes done in one season rather than spreading it out, and just have a mess for one year.
"The only saving grace is we have seven years to plan for it. It will be hugely difficult. But we are stuck with it and have to get on with it.
"It couldn’t be more messy. It’s unsatisfactory, but it’s back to Mr Blatter again."
10.48 Moving the World Cup will also have a knock-on effect for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. Junior Binyam, director of communications for the Confederation of African Football, told the BBC: "Caf is backing up 100 per cent the proposals of task force and will adjust the calendar accordingly when a final decision will be made on the schedule of Qatar 2022‎."
10.45 Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce will oppose any move to hold the final as late as Dec 23.
Boyce, from Northern Ireland, said moving the World Cup to the winter was a "common sense" decision but that a final on Dec 23 would be too close to Christmas and the traditional festive matches.
I think that is too close to Christmas - that's the only reservation I would have and I would like it a week earlier, but I want to wait until the FIFA executive committee meeting to hear all the details about the dates.
"I welcome the fact all the stakeholders have been involved and although this is not going to please everyone I think common sense has prevailed.
"It will cause a lot of disruption but it is eight years away and people should have enough time to make it work."
10.31 Uefa, meanwhile, have this morning backed Fifa's recommendation to move the World Cup to Nov/Dec.
Uefa supports the recommendation made by the Fifa Task Force for the International Match Calendar 2018-24 to stage the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar from late November to late December 2022.
Uefa believes that - for the benefits of players and fans - the event should be played in winter and now awaits the final decision from the Fifa Executive Committee meeting on 18/19 March 2015.
Uefa sees no major issues in rescheduling its competitions for the 2022/23 season, should the 2022 Fifa World Cup proposal be approved by the FIFA Executive Committee, and Uefa acknowledges that the competition may be shortened and thus that the release period of players be reduced.
10.15 Telegraph reader William Hargreaves has his say on the Fifa/Qatar palavar.
All of this when I think that people are making a very good case for there being a mid-winter break? C.f. Sterling being sent on holliers and coming back in better form.
There will be all sorts of legal loopholes to jump through with regard to rescheduling club matches and potential lost or delayed income, I should think.
It might end up being a worthwhile and memorable exercise but I'll bet it won't be repeated.
10.05 According to BBC producer Samuel Smith, Premier League chief Richard Scudamore is disappointed by a "wrong" decision by Fifa.

<noframe>Twitter: Samuel Smith - Scudamore says he feels "a little bit let down by UEFA" over being "pretty much told" about the recommendation for Nov-Dec 2022 World Cup.</noframe>
09.51 A November/December World Cup could force a seven-week break in the Premier League programme with suggestions that it could resume on Boxing Day 2022. Here's more from Ben Rumsby:
A switch to the winter would involve a complete overhaul of the fixture calendars of around 50 countries around the world.
It would also force clubs and competition organisers in those countries to decide whether to fight the Fifa decision legally or seek compensation for the disruption caused.
If not, it would allow the game’s governing body to put to bed one of the biggest issues thrown up by the most controversial ever award of a major sports event.
Fifa ignored serious concerns over the heat in Qatar, where summer temperatures regularly exceed 40 degrees centigrade, in handing the World Cup to the tiny Middle East country in December 2010.
The allegations of serious corruption over that vote to have emerged since merely compounded the controversy over a choice of host from a bidding process in which there was no suggestion of the 2022 tournament being staged in the winter.
Fifa’s statement also revealed the task force had discussed staging the 2021 Confederations Cup in another Asian confederation country during the traditional June-July window and using another Fifa competition such as the Club World Cup as the operational test event for Qatar 2022 in November-December 2021.

09.39 The thought of having a Christmas World Cup is laughable and a discussion we wouldn't even be having right now if Australia had rightly been given the tournament. Australia finished last in the voting in 2010 but should have been the stand-out contenders.
When the corruption claims first surfaced concerning Qatar's successful World Cup bid, Henry Winter wrote about what it would be like if we were discussing Australia, a sports-mad country wanting to put on party, had won the rights.
Imagine if 2022 were in Australia. There would be no broadcasting issues, frustrations in Europe over kick-off times, but that does not lessen the excitement English cricket fans feel for the Ashes when staged at the MCG etc. Anyway, sporting competitions should not be based solely on the viewing habits of Euro-man. Inevitable changes to working patterns over the next decade, blurring night and day shifts, make time-zones even less of an issue.
Imagine the weather in Australia in June and July, their winter, perfect for a football competition. Imagine the nightlife for fans, the days out on beaches, the trips to incredible places like the Great Barrier Reef or marvelling at the view from the top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Some of the most iconic stadia names would be used: MCG, Stadium Australia of Olympics fame and the Adelaide Oval. Imagine Australia 2022.

09.28 Some experts and fans are already speculating that a winter World Cup would benefit England. Take the BBC's Dan Roan for instance. Do you agree that Roy Hodgson's David Beckham's 2022 side could seriously be highly-fancied candidates to end what is likely be a 56-year long wait for the trophy?
<noframe>Twitter: Dan Roan - Look on the bright side. A winter World Cup should theoretically give England their best ever chance of some success in 22. If they qualify</noframe>
09.20 Today's recommendation from Fifa was reported by our man Ben Rumsby in the Sunday Telegraph who revealed that the governing body had secretly renegotiated billions of pounds worth of broadcast contracts to allow it to stage a winter World Cup in Qatar at no reduction in the value of those deals.
Here's more on that:
Despite opposition from networks to rescheduling the 2022 tournament, particularly from Fox Sports in the United States, it is understood agreements have been struck which have seen contracts updated to protect Fifa from legal action if a much-anticipated switch to November/December takes place.
Remarkably, it appears this has been achieved at no cost, even though the value of the rights to some broadcasters may be lower in the winter than the summer.
That would particularly apply in America, where a November/December World Cup would clash with the National Football League season.
The revelation Fifa has quelled unrest among its broadcast partners follows its surprise announcement just over a week and a half ago that Fox, NBCUniversal’s Telemundo and Canada’s CTV/TSN had all been granted extensions covering the 2026 event.
The value of the new contracts was not disclosed, leading to speculation they had been awarded as compensation for the debacle over 2022.
That intensified when ESPN and Univision, former broadcast partners of Fifa, issued angry statements confirming they had not been invited to bid.
Fifa described the extensions as “the result of a detailed assessment of the market and discussions with the relevant broadcasters”.
It did not respond to requests for comment on whether a potential 2022 switch played any part in those negotiations or on the nature of its other renegotiated deals.
Fifa’s director of TV, Niclas Ericson, said: “Based on the request of the Fifa executive committee from September 2013, a consultation process was initiated with all relevant stakeholders, including broadcasters, to find the most viable date for the 2022 Fifa World Cup. This consultation process with broadcasters has gone well.”
09.08 Much discussion around the Qatar World Cup has focused on the ridiculous temperatures. These are the kind of highs holidaymakers dream of, footballers less so. January and February are the coolest months of the year with November still producing roasting temperatures of 29c.

08.55 Morning all. Fifa have spoken. Or more their task force have and recommended that the Qatar World Cup in 2022 is held in winter, probably in November and December to avoid the soaring heat in the Gulf state.
This means that potentially the World Cup final will be played on December 23 - two days before Christmas - which at least means most England players will finally get the festive period off.
What do you make of today's recommendation? What effect will it have on the 2022/23 Premier League season? It's the winter break a host of top-flight bosses have been seeking but for all the wrong reasons.
A final decision will be made in March with Fifa also not yet ruling out hosting the tournament in January and February - which could have a knock-on effect for the Winter Olympics in 2023. So many issues to discuss, please get in touch.
