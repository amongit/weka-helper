Wales v Ireland, Six Nations 2015: Warren Gatland names unchanged side

There were no surprises from Wales head coach Warren Gatland on Tuesday in Cardiff. He announced an unchanged side to face Ireland on Saturday and he did not launch any verbal grenades their way either.
Gatland’s only two changes from the side that won comfortably in Paris were on the bench where he called up prop Rob Evans and lock Jake Ball for the injured Paul James and Bradley Davies.
And he insisted that, whilst this is a huge match in terms of the destination of the championship title, it is certainly no grudge match.
“There are definitely no hard feelings or bad blood between the teams,” he said. “It is just a very strong rivalry in terms of knowing each other so well and playing each other so often. It is like playing your big brother in the back yard. You want to beat him as often as you possibly can. I don’t think Saturday is going to be any different.”

Wales were beaten 26-3 last year in Dublin and Gatland admits that they were caught napping in many regards.
“We were probably a little bit surprised by the way they played,” he said. “We got caught up in a kicking game and they drove exceptionally well at line-out time. As a coaching team we probably got the captain’s run wrong too. We had a half an hour/40-minute bus ride and then the run on a pretty heavy pitch. It probably wasn’t the best preparation the day before a game.”
Given the way Ireland defeated England, Gatland is not expecting too many surprises this time. “We are expecting a lot of ball in the air,” he said. “It is something we have worked really hard on and we think we are pretty good in the air. Discipline is also going to be important- not giving them an opportunity to kick to touch to use their driven line out and hopefully not exposing ourselves to them putting the ball in the air. Tactically we know what’s coming.”

And amid that Gatland is well aware of the threat posed by Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton (who was on Tuesday pronounced fit for Saturday).
“We are playing against the in-form half-back pairing in world rugby,” said Gatland. “Conor Murray since the British and Irish Lions tour has come on leaps and bounds. He is a quality number nine. If I look back at him being involved with the Lions he was one of the most improved players on that tour. If there had been a fourth Test he would have been pushing for a start. The combination with Sexton is exceptional.”
Sam Warburton will captain Wales for a record 34th time. “It’s exceptional for Sam,” said George North. “He is a quality player and leads from the front and as a captain you cannot ask any more. It’s not necessarily what he says, it’s the actions he does. He is the kind of man that will never ask you to do something he wouldn’t do himself.”
