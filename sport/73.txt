Driver Jamie Dick diagnosed with diabetes after Phoenix race
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- NASCAR driver Jamie Dick has been diagnosed with diabetes after reporting dizziness and fatigue at Phoenix International Raceway.
Dick, the owner and driver for Viva Motorsports in the Xfinity Series, was treated after Saturday's race in the infield care center. He was sent to a local hospital for further tests, and revealed his diagnosis Monday.
The team called the diagnosis ''onset diabetes,'' which is Type 2 and non-insulin-dependent.
Jeffrey Earnhardt will replace Dick in the No. 55 Chevrolet this weekend at California.
Dick said in a statement he'll take some time to learn about ''this disease and do whatever it takes to get back behind the wheel as soon as possible.''
