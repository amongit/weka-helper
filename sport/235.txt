Manny Pacquiao's coach Freddie Roach is studying Floyd Mayweather's supposed 'dirty tricks' to prepare Manny Pacquiao for the pair's Las Vegas showdown on May 2.
The process of transforming Pacquiao into a fighting machine has begun at the Wild Card Gym in the heart of Hollywood, and coach Roach is paying particular attention to Mayweather’s use of his elbows and shoulders.
Sparring partners for Pacquiao were identified as “Speedy” Rashidi Ellis (13-0, 10 KOs) and Kenneth Simms, Jr (5-0, 2 KOs).
“Both fighters are tall and young at 21. They are gifted with power and blazing hand speed and can simulate Floyd’s fighting style,” said Roach.

The 5’9 Ellis, a native of Lynn, Massachusetts, had impressive boxing records which include a 2012 National Police athletic League Championship crown, three-time New England Golden Gloves Championship plum, Rocky Marciano Amateur Boxing Tournament title and a silver medal at the Independent Cup in the Dominican Republic. The 5’10 Sims, Jr, from Chicago, Illinois, was an eight-time national amateur boxing champion.
“Both are very young and have good potentials to become world champions,” Roach said, adding that he still has four others waiting in the wings to help prepare the Filipino for what he called “the biggest fight in his life.”

The names of four other sparring partners are being kept under wraps in the light of the reported sabotage attempts by Mayweather’s camp to dissuade them from helping Pacquiao.
Pacquiao will spar on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday of every week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are reserved for physical conditioning and stamina building.
“Manny is in good shape,” said Roach. "We will make as competitive as possible as we want him to win by knockout. We have to win this fight because if we fail, the entire world will be very disappointed.”
“I can see it in his eyes, in his body movement, his attitude in training that he really wants to win and win decisively."

Floyd Mayweather is undergoing "caveman training" as part of his camp in the build-up to facing Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2.
Mayweather has posted a video to Instragram that shows him preparing for the fight by using Rocky-style 'back to basics' training techniques, more common these days in mixed martial arts training.

Alongside a traditional boxer's workout of ring practice and bag work, Mayweather can be seen chopping wood to hone his muscles.
Mayweather also published a video that shows him pounding the streets of his hometown at night, as well as one going behind the scenes at the fighters' press conference in Los Angeles.


Manny Pacquiao has purchased a palatial 10,000 square foot Beverly Hills mansion as a gift to his wife Jinkee and their children.
It was formerly owned by Sean Combs, AKA P. Diddy, the American rapper, record producer, actor and entrepreneur.
“Behind all my success in life is my wife Jinkee. I wanted to surprise them. But this is no longer a secret. Maybe they knew it already. I could not hide it from the media. Reporters are following me wherever I go,” Pacquiao said.
Pacquiao and his team dropped by his Beverly Hills mansion after attending a church service on Sunday. The prime estate is located inside the guard-gated, posh neighborhood known as the Summit.

The current owners, Roger and Gale Dauer, purchased the mansion in 2011. “We reconstructed the house and made some expansion. There were three buyers including Manny Pacquiao. The two other buyers quoted a much higher price but we decided to sell it to him. We like him very much,” the Dauer couple said.
An impressive spiral staircase and a massive chandelier greet the guests upon entry at the reception hall of the two-story grandiose estate. The ground level features a chef’s kitchen, a state-of-the-art media room and a family room with a sports bar. There are seven bedrooms – including a master’s suite – and seven and a half baths upstairs.
Each room boasts of a Creston home automation with temperature, lighting and audio iPad control. The 30,000-square-foot total lot area includes a wide cobblestone driveway, a swimming pool with fountain and spa, several fire pits and patios.

Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini, the former WBA lightweight champion who was a fan favourite after battles with the likes of Alexis Arguello, Livingstone Bramble and Hector Camacho, has told OTR Boxing Radio that Manny Pacquiao will create problems for Floyd Mayweather, but he believes the American will eventually triumph when they meet at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
"Pacquiao is a bad style for Mayweather because Mayweather likes to lean to his right and Pacquiao doesn’t fight like a traditional southpaw, he does things backwards.
"Pacquiao moves to his left and so is his straight left hand. Mayweather bends his body right in line for a left hand. It will be an interesting fight, I think Pacquiao will make him fight right from the jump and it will be interesting to see what happens.
Trouble: Manny Pacquiao's fighting style could cause problems for Floyd Mayweather
"They’re both special fighters but Mayweather is bigger, faster and stronger - that’s a trifecta in boxing. I think Mayweather beats him by decision. Not stoppage, decision."
Mancini believes it would have been the same outcome six years ago. Pretty much on the money as most people are seeing the big fight.
