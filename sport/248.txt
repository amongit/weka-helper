Carl Frampton and Barry McGuigan deliver boxing success on ITV

Saturday night’s alright for fighting – in fact, a lot better than alright for ITV. Carl Frampton and manager Barry McGuigan delivered the goods in Belfast as big-time boxing made a jubilant return to terrestrial television, and fight fans will be hoping for more of the same.
With the sweet meat on offer from putting the sweet science on pay-per-view and subscription TV, boxing promoters came to regard regular telly as an option of last resort. But in both fighting and fight‑making, you do not necessarily have to go for the knockout blow from the first bell, and McGuigan is showing plenty of ring-craft as he patiently shapes the super bantamweight from Tiger’s Bay, Belfast into a major sporting success.
To do it, you need a fighter, credible but beatable opposition, a story, a fanbase and a home venue, and on Saturday night’s evidence all of these elements are in place. Those watching at home will have seen Frampton roared on by a passionate crowd of 9,000 in Belfast’s Odyssey Arena. It sounded like 39,000. The fans inside made it feel like a major event, and that comes across on the TV, which in turn means the casual fan at home will buy in.
Uncontained joy: 30 years on, McGuigan crafts another boxing success
Frampton himself is a serious talent, and likeable with it. Chris Avalos, from the unfashionable bit of the Mojave desert, was a legit challenger and came with a decent reputation and some excellent argy-bargy at the weigh-in under his belt. Frampton sorted him out in no uncertain terms, a fifth-round stoppage. David Haye, punditing, noted: “The referee got the stoppage spot-on. Not too early, not too late. Another ten seconds and that guy is getting stretchered out of there.”

Talking of excellent timing, the fight came on McGuigan’s 54th birthday, and it is 30 years this year since the night that immortalised him, the 1985 world title win over Eusebio Pedroza at Loftus Road watched by 19 million people on TV.
Hero is an overused word in sport but not for McGuigan, the Catholic who married a Protestant and became a beacon of hope in the Troubles. Frampton, in a video package shown before the fight, said: “When Barry fought, the fighting stopped for an hour. It was huge.”
McGuigan added the rest of the combo: “Carl lived in a Loyalist area, somebody was killed and there was rioting all the time. So he was confronted with this every time he opened his front door.”
In a mirror-image of McGuigan’s own marriage, Frampton wed a Catholic. “I live vicariously through him. It’s almost like it was meant to happen,” McGuigan said of his protege. Broad brush strokes maybe, but few stories are as enjoyable as the master-and-apprentice, and ITV was more than happy to deliver the message.
Mark Pougatch had another good night, unobtrusively but assuredly moving things along not just on the ITV main event but also on the lead‑in from 7.30pm on ITV4. The undercard was the usual mixture of “youngster to keep an eye on”, such as middleweight Conrad Cummings, also from the McGuigan stable, and “that bloke should really not be doing this for a living”, like Malkhaz Tatrishvili, a bantamweight from Georgia who turned his back on Marco McCullough and was lucky to escape without tragedy from a one‑round mismatch. The advantage of having ITV4 as an overspill is that this sort of unpalatable starter doesn’t sour the main dish.
Boxing, once the purest and the murkiest of sports, has ever been as much about the intrigue of the purse as the action on the canvas: McGuigan landed some excellent shots after the Frampton fight when Scott Quigg, who holds the WBA (Regular) super bantamweight belt, came into the ring and was called out by Frampton and manager.
Frampton said: “Scott needs to remember who the real world champion is, but I would love a summer showdown with him.”
Friend or foe: Frampton is keen on a summer bout with Quigg
Quigg is an Eddie Hearn (and thus Sky) fighter, so who knows how that would work, but the last word went to McGuigan, who said: “Carl is a sensational fighter and over the next two years we are going to prove that. We really hope we have got ITV along with us.” Right on the nose.
Plenty of fans will be hoping it happens too. After this, leave the fight-making to McGuigan.
