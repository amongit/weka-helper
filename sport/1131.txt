Rafael Nadal is out of the 2015 Australian Open, beaten 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 (5) in the quarter-finals by seventh seed Tomas Berdych on Tuesday.
Nadal, the tournament's third seed and a 14-time Grand Slam singles champion, said before the competition began that his lack of match fitness due to injuries and illness in the last half of 2014 made him unlikely to win more than a few rounds at Melbourne Park.
Nadal saved two match points in the 12th game of the final set, sending it to a tiebreaker. Berdych led 5-2 and finally ended the encounter on Rod Laver Arena on his fourth match point when Nadal netted a return of serve.
Coming into the Australian Open, Nadal had played only eight matches since last June because of a right wrist injury and appendix surgery in November.
An 18th successive defeat of Berdych by the Spaniard would have set a new record for men's tennis.

"It's obvious that I needed something more to be more competitive as I did in the third," Nadal said after the match.
"The third was the right set, the right game that I had to play. But is obvious that before I didn't play with the right confidence, with the right intensity, losing court, playing very short. I make him play very easy.
"So you cannot expect to win matches in quarter finals of Grand Slam helping the opponent to play well. That's what I did."
