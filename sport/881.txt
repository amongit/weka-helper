Louis van Gaal faces the biggest test yet of his reign at Manchester United when his protogee Jose Mourinho brings his Chelsea side to Old Trafford on Sunday.
In last season's equivalent fixture Chelsea parked the bus and claimed a 0-0 draw, but that was before everyone realised just how rubbish David Moyes's United really were and that Old Trafford was actually an easy place to go and win.
Van Gaal has signed many, many players including Radamel Falcao. Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw and the new additions have improved the team to such an extent that they are now able to go to places like West Brom and claim a 2-2 draw courtesy of a late equaliser.
But Chelsea are going to be a whole different kind of test for Van Gaal and his merry men.
Thankfully JJ Bull and Thom Gibbs have braved the cauldron of Old Trafford and have played the game already using a magic Playstation 4 box and the game FIFA15.

Thom takes control of United's array of attacking talent (and Phil Jones) while JJ grabs the steering wheel of Chelsea's giant bus like he's Sandra Bullock in Speed.
But who will take home the glory of a theoretical three massive, massive Premier League points?
There's only one way to find out, and it's reliant on you pressing the play button on the video you can see above these words.
