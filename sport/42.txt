Rays' Cobb expected to miss opener due to forearm injury
DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb has tendinitis in his right forearm and will miss his planned opening-day start against Baltimore on April 6.
Rays President of Baseball Operations Matt Silverman made the announcement before Wednesday's game against Toronto, a day after the 27-year-old right-hander was removed after throwing three perfect innings in a 5-3 win over Philadelphia. Cobb had an MRI after the game.
''It's never easy to know you have to take a step back,'' Cobb said during a telephone conference call. ''The whole situation could be a lot worse.''
Silverman hopes Cobb will be able to return in mid-to-late April.
''I think we can safely say that,'' said Cobb, who won't throw for a week.
Cobb felt tightness in the bullpen before Tuesday's game, but his arm loosened once he took the mound. He had been scheduled to pitch four innings.
''The arm felt good enough to pitch, so I pitched,'' Cobb said.
Silverman said it is too early to announce a new opening-day starter. Chris Archer is considered a top contender.
Another rotation member, left-hander Drew Smyly, has resumed playing catch after being sidelined by shoulder tendinitis. He also is not expected to be ready for the opener.
Smyly's timetable should become clearer in the next few days.
''The beginning of April is going to be a challenge,'' Silverman said.
Rotation candidate Alex Colome, out with pneumonia, will not resume baseball activities for a week.
