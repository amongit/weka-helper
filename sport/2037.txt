Doug Martin To Buccaneers With 31st Pick In 2012 NFL Draft Round 1
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Buccaneers addressed their need for a running back, selecting Boise State's Doug Martin with the 31st pick in the first round of the NFL draft.

The Bucs traded the fifth overall pick to Jacksonville Thursday night for the Jaguars' seventh overall pick to get Alabama safety Mark Barron, but remained determined to find help on offense for young quarterback Josh Freeman.

They landed Martin after trading their second-round selection — no. 36 overall — and swapping fourth-round picks with the Denver Broncos.

Martin averaged 5.56 yards per carry and scored 43 touchdowns while rushing for 3,431 in four seasons at Boise State. He gained 1,299 yards and scored 16 TDs as a senior.
