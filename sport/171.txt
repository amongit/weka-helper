5 Montenegrin players detained for suspected match-fixing
PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) -- Police say they have detained five Montenegrin soccer players suspected of match-fixing.
Police said Wednesday the suspects were arrested in four different towns in the small Adriatic state. They say the group of players are accused of forming a ''criminal enterprise'' that arranged outcomes of local matches and competitions.
No other details were immediately released. The suspects include players from Montenegro's first division and lower divisions.
Match-fixing is believed to be widespread throughout the Balkans and involving local players, referees and club officials.
