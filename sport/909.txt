Leading bookmakers are making Rory McIlroy the odds-on favourite in the betting to be the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2014, going into this weekend's awards ceremony in Glasgow.
The two-time major winner in 2014 was as short as 1-9 to win the prize following his victory in the US PGA Championship but his odds have been pushed out after support for Lewis Hamilton, who is second best in the market at 13-8.
"This award looked done and dusted when Rory claimed his second major of the year and helped Europe to the Ryder Cup, however, ever since Lewis Hamilton picked up the Drivers' Title in Abu Dhabi, the British driver has been popular with punters who believe it is a two-horse race going into Sunday's awards ceremony," said Coral's John Hill.
McIlroy, who won two majors and helped Europe retain the Ryder Cup in a stunning 2014, was also named the British Sports Journalists Association's Sportsman of the Year on Thursday.
The Irishman, who won the British Open and PGA Championship, finished ahead of Hamilton and Commonwealth and European long jump gold medal winner Greg Rutherford in a ballot of the British association's members.
