Going into this game Barcelona were being doubted, what with Lionel Messi and team-mate Gerard Pique being seen leaving a late-night Catalan casino just 48 hours beforehand, coach Luis Enrique's methods were being called into question, and Luis Suárez's indifferent season was being dissected.

In the event, Barcelona dominated the first half, with Suarez carrying on against English defences where he left off at the World Cup for Uruguay.
Here's how the match stats broke down - and our analysis of key players Luis Suarez, the Barca forward, and Vincent Kompany, City's captain in central defence.
