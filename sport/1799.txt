Nicolas Batum Cheap Shot Against Juan Carlos Navarro During France-Spain Basketball Game (VIDEO)
Nicolas Batum took a page out of Argentine Facundo Campazzo's book on Wednesday, delivering a cheap shot in the final minute of Spain's victory over France in the Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals.
All Batum needs now is a lesson from Chris Paul on how to get away with it.
After Juan Carlos Navarro received an inbounds pass with 24.4 seconds left, Batum ran over and landed a punch to his groin. Batum was immediately called for a foul, but a scuffle ensued as Jose Calderon and a couple teammates ran over and started barking at him. The referees quickly intervened and separated everyone involved.
Asked why he threw the punch, Batum said after the game that he "wanted to give him a good reason to flop."
Both teams were said to have flopped several times throughout the game, even drawing the ire of the commentators, one of which called the contest a "farce."
Either way, the incident caused some NBA media members to question why Batum wasn't thrown out of the game.
UPDATE: Batum took to Twitter after France's loss to apologize for the punch.
