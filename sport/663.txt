At a news conference on Thursday, Wigan manager Roberto Martinez spoke about this Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester City and refused to be drawn on rumours linking him to the Everton managerial role.
The Goodison Park role will become vacant after it was confirmed existing boss David Moyes will become Manchester United manager at the end of the season, following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.
"No, no, no...no. It would be a waste of time for anyone at the moment," Martinez said, when asked if he had been contacted by Everton.
He swiftly turned attention to Wigan's remaining "finals".
"The most important aspect is to be as ready as we can for Saturday and then the other two incredible finals within the league so, as I say, this is the peak time for Wigan Athletic and we need to make sure that we are ready for our fans to be very proud and to enjoy a really strong ending of the season. That is what we have to fight for."
