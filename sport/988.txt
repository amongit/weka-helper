Volvo Ocean Race 2011/12: Groupama skipper Franck Cammas rides crest of a wave after epic win

There were only six boats in this year's Volvo Ocean Race, yet it proved to be the closest of any in the event’s 39-year history.
For a few thousand miles, it looked like Frenchman Cammas and his international crew would need the final in-port race in Galway on Saturday — the last opportunity to nail a few points — to seal victory.

In the end, their second place in the final ocean leg from Lorient in France was enough to fend off any last-gasp kicks from their three main rivals Telefónica, Puma and Camper — the latter team finishing the nine-month, 40,000 nautical mile marathon by notching their first leg win.
All three had threatened to rain on Groupama’s parade but by the ninth leg, Cammas’ diverse crew of Irish, Swedish, Australian, Kiwi and French sailors were confident they had the fastest boat in the fleet and arguably the best all-round skills.

They may have had these from the start but the decision-making by Cammas, and his navigator Jean-Luc Nélias, in the early legs had raised doubts over their performance, especially with Iker Martinez’s Telefónica team blazing a trail in the first 15,000nm.

In the latter stages, as the contests became closer, Groupama vowed to be more conservative in their tactics. It paid rapid dividends. They held their nerve and even managed a third place in Leg 5 to Brazil despite suffering a broken mast and four injured crew.
It was this gutsy attitude that served them so well towards the end when the pressure cranked up.
Having won the penultimate in-port race in Lorient, they needed to finish fourth in Galway to make certain of victory. So when the boat slipped over the line in Galway just seven minutes behind Camper, giving Irish watch leader Damian Foxall the perfect homecoming, the win was complete.
While it was Foxall’s first Volvo Ocean Race win in four tries, Cammas achieved victory with his first attempt.

He said: “It was always my dream just to participate in this race. Without doubt, this is the best thing I’ve done.”
After one of the most exciting events in memory, the 10th Volvo Ocean Race drew to a close with future plans, unveiled in Lorient last week, to build a fleet of one-design boats — and raise the benchmark even further for the next race in 2014
