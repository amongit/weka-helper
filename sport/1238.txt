Manchester United left Anfield with a 2-1 victory to put them in command of the persuit for fourth, but assistance came from an unlikely source as Gerrard was sent off less than a minute seconds after his half-time introduction.
The Liverpool captain could have no complaints. He stamped on Ander Herrera's ankle - a mental aberration after he'd been given the call to salvage the game.
Maybe he was too pumped up awaiting his opportunity having sat on the bench for 45 minutes, but already a goal down to Juan Mata, the Spanish midfielder inflicted further punishment on the 10 men with a superb volley before Daniel Sturridge briefly offered hope.
Sturridge reduced the deficit on 70 minutes, beating De Gea at the near post to restore hope, leaving United to sweat on a result that should have been secure - especially after Rooney missed a last minute penalty.
