Scottish flag-bearer Euan Burton aiming to make country proud at Commonwealth Games

Euan Burton can already picture the scene. “How good would it be if you went down to the canteen in the athletes’ village one morning and saw Usain Bolt getting stuck into a bit of haggis?” he ponders. “After all, he went for the chicken nuggets in London, didn’t he?”
Burton can be forgiven a few patriotic flights of fancy. After seven years of planning, an eyewatering outlay of £523 million, and the usual pre-competition scare stories about empty seats, athlete withdrawals and questionable team uniforms, Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games begin tonight, with Burton as their poster-boy. The 35-year-old judoka is the flag-bearer for the home team in the opening ceremony at Celtic Park, a role he describes as a “fantastic privilege”, even if the pay-off is that he has to fulfil it while clad in Scotland’s official parade uniform – the kind of outfit which might have been rejected by the costume designer for ‘Brigadoon’ for being slightly too twee.
It is a big moment for Burton – he has admitted to having trawled YouTube for reruns of Sir Chris Hoy’s performance as Team GB flagbearer at the London 2012 Olympics – but an even bigger one for Scotland. The last time these Games were staged in the country, in Edinburgh in 1986, the legacy was one of financial chaos and political embarrassment: over 30 countries, from Africa and the Caribbean, boycotted the event in protest at the British Government’s policy of dealing with South Africa’s apartheid regime, and the company running the event made losses of £4.3 million.
Nobody is expecting the 2014 edition to suffer such indignities, and while organisers will probably experience a few first-night flutters of anxiety this evening, the overwhelming feeling is one of anticipation, and particularly for Scotland’s 310-strong team of athletes, the largest they have assembled for a Commonwealth Games. “It hasn’t felt real until the last few days – then we went to the Village and suddenly, wow, you realise this thing is upon you: you see all the teams in their different tracksuits, that kind of thing, and it becomes very real,” Burton says.
“There are probably some nerves with it being on home soil but, honestly, the sensation I have picked up on is that people are just very excited to have this event here.

“It kind of works on two levels. For Scotland, there is a sense that the whole country is involved and, whether you are from the Highlands and Islands or the Borders, the whole ethos has been about trying to create a team which people can support.
“But the second element is that these are also Glasgow’s Games, and you can feel the city getting behind it. When we arrived at the athletes’ village there were a couple of old dears on the street feeding some of the Games Makers who had been ferrying the athletes about. These were old girls of 80 years old, and they were just so thrilled to have this event on their doorstep. You can feel the way the city has come together for this event: people are ready to show what we can do.”
Yet these Games are not just of sporting significance. The looming vote on Scottish independence – which takes place just 46 days after the Games close on Aug 3 – adds a frisson of political intrigue to every Scottish medal that is banked in the coming fortnight. In public at least, the politicians are keeping their distance, but that could quickly change if the home athletes deliver a glut of gold: just remember Alex Salmond waving the Saltire in Wimbledon’s Royal Box last year to celebrate Andy Murray’s triumph.
Burton is not about to reveal which box he plans to cross in the referendum in September, but neither is he oblivious to the Games’ political context. “We’ve got the biggest sporting event in Scotland coming up now and then immediately after we’ve got the biggest political event – there’s no point trying to pretend people aren’t aware of that,” he says. From an athlete’s point of view, you just want the focus at the Games to be on what is going on in the field of play, and not what your view of independence might be. I don’t think any of the athletes are going to get embroiled in that while they’re competing.”
In that sense, Burton was a smart choice as Team Scotland’s figurehead. He is without doubt a proud Scot, dividing his time between his home in Edinburgh and the judo centre in Ratho, but he is hardly likely to allow himself to be used as a political rallying point by nationalists: he was born in that bastion of the English home counties, Ascot, and is married to Team England’s star judoka, Gemma Gibbons, a silver medallist at the London Olympics. Thankfully for Burton, Scotland has no athlete in Gibbons’ weight category, so he can offer her his full support without fear of the inevitable Twitter backlash.
Besides, he has other concerns, not least steeling himself for his own pursuit of gold in Saturday’s 100kg event. After a 10-year career at elite level, this will be Burton’s final major competition: indeed, it was only nine months ago that he committed to returning to the mat, having previously decided to pursue coaching. That decision had been prompted by his crushing disappointment at London 2012, when he lost to Canada’s Antoine Valois-Fortier in the second round.
Burton’s post-bout interview, when he tearfully admonished himself for “letting everyone down – myself, my mum and dad, everybody I’ve ever trained with”, was one of the most grimly compelling pieces of television produced by those Games.
Burton insists that the Commonwealth Games are not about seizing “redemption” for London, but the steely edge in his voice when he lays out his ambitions for Glasgow is obvious.
“I have watched that defeat in London once,” he says. “Just once. It wasn’t easy. The whole focus of my career had been to become Olympic champion and I didn’t manage to achieve it. Nothing that happens in Glasgow will change that or make it easier to deal with.
“I was very fortunate to extend my career to a home Commonwealth Games: if it had been held anywhere else I might have thought twice about competing. But it’s here and it would be great to go out on a high.”
A golden farewell for Burton would undoubtedly be one of the sights of the Games: one even more popular, perhaps, than Bolt tucking into that haggis.
