Manchester United have made a £16 million bid for Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo.
The Argentina defender - who had been strongly linked with a move to Southampton - is facing disciplinary action from his club after reportedly refusing to train and handing in a transfer request in a bid to force through a move to United.

Sporting president Bruno de Carvalho said that both Rojo and team-mate Islam Slimani, a target for Leicester City, are "subject to strong disciplinary measures" and will not play in the club's Portuguese league opener against Academica on Saturday.

"There is no player bigger than the club," De Carvalho told Portuguese television. "I would not give up the honour, the club's history, for the attitudes of anyone.
"I give a piece of advice: don't use the press, be professional. These two, in defence of our magnificent group, must be removed. They are subject to strong disciplinary measures."
The 24-year-old Rojo, who scored against Nigeria during the World Cup in Brazil, is comfortable playing in a three-man defence which may appeal to Louis van Gaal as he continues to implement tactical change at Old Trafford.
Having agreed to the signings of Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw - moves that were lined up before the Dutchman took charge at Old Trafford - Van Gaal said he would examine his squad during their pre-season tour of the United States before identifying which areas of the squad needed strengthening.
Rojo may be the first part of that rebuilding process but he may not be the last.
Daley Blind – who was hugely impressive for Van Gaal's Holland during the World Cup - continues to be linked with a move to Old Trafford.
"I am happy here in Amsterdam," the Ajax defender said. "But if there comes another club I will have to think about it and then we will see. I will think about my options. For now I will focus on Ajax and we will see what happens next week."
Angel di Maria may also be the subject of a £50 million bid from United. The Real Madrid midfielder was on the bench for Tuesday's Super Cup against Sevilla as Carlo Ancelotti handed new signing James Rodriguez his first start following his transfer from Monaco.
"Until now he is a Real Madrid player and we will have to wait to see what will happen," said Ancelotti after the victory in Cardiff.
