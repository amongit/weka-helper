Former British number one Laura Robson will not take up a wildcard into qualifying for this month's Miami Open after a 14-month injury absence.
Her agent, Max Eisenbud, says she has not suffered any setbacks and is getting "closer and closer" to making her first appearance.
The 21-year-old has not played since losing in the first round of last year's Australian Open.
Robson had surgery on her left wrist last April.
She reached a career high of 27 in the world in 2013.
Fellow Briton Kyle Edmund, 21, has been given a wildcard into the main draw for the men's event after rising to 153 in the world.
