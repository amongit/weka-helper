Almost £50,000 has been donated to charity in memory of a runner who died after crossing the finishing line of the London Marathon, as it was revealed he had breathing difficulties which he blamed on pollution.
Robert Berry, 42, was competing to raise money for the National Osteoporosis Society in tribute to his “inspirational” mother Ann, 72, who has lived with a brittle bone condition for two decades.
The married father of two collapsed at the finish line of Sunday’s race and was given immediate medical attention before being rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
In his running blog, Mr Berry revealed that he had been having breathing problems which he thought may have been caused by pollution and the Sahara dust cloud which engulfed the UK last month.
The Sunday before the race he noted that his problems were easing, but added: “I have now used my inhaler 3 times in the last week whereas I might use it 3 times in year”

Tragic marathon runner 'inspired by dead brother'
After his death was announced his Just Giving page saw more than 4,000 donations to the charity.
The amount raised at 7pm on Monday stood at almost £3,000, but it rose steadily and reached £49,855 by Tuesday afternoon, almost times his original target.
In a message on his personal website, Mr Berry, from Reading wrote: "This page is dedicated to my mum, who despite being diagnosed with osteoporosis at the relatively early age of 52 years, has been an inspiration through the continued positive outlook she has displayed ever since, despite some quite clear discomfort."
Marathon organisers have said that his death left the event “tinged with sadness”.
Meanwhile, an elite runner from Sierra Leone who disappeared after finishing the women's race in 20th place is still missing.
Scotland Yard launched an appeal to find Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, when she did not return to her temporary accommodation in Greenwich, where she had been staying since arriving in the UK on April 7.
The runner, who was due to fly home on Monday, has no known links to the UK and was not in possession of a mobile phone.
Since Mr Berry’s death was announced tributes and donations have poured in.
The National Osteoporosis Society said in a statement on his Just Giving site: We are really touched by the incredible generosity in tribute to Mr Berry, who wrote so movingly about why he was raising money to help fight osteoporosis.
"When the time is right, we would like to discuss with his family the options available for how the funds raised in his memory may be used."
Barry Millsom, who donated £20 to the charity, wrote: “My mother has the same. It's such a crippling disease and your plight to raise awareness should be recognised by as many people as possible. Rest in peace Rob, I'm sure your mum is truly proud of you.”
Mark Jameson, who also ran the marathon, donated £10 and wrote: "God bless you Rob. Your family must be so proud of you, raising money to help your Mum and others. So sorry it had to end in this way. RIP."
An anonymous donor wrote: "I'm so sorry. I saw you near the finish line. I wish i could have helped prevent your death. So so admirable that you finished. Although I don't know you I am very proud of you. God bless x
Mr Berry is the 12th person to die in the London Marathon’s 34 year history. One of the biggest death tolls in recent years came during the 2005 Great North Run, where four people died.
The last death in the event was in 2012 when hairdresser Claire Squires, 30, from North Kilworth, Leicestershire, collapsed a mile from the finishing line and died later from cardiac failure.
She was raising money for the Samaritans and in the week after her death donations to her fundraising website jumped from £500 to more than £1m.
Mr Berry, who worked in IT services, ran the Reading half marathon last month and the Windsor half marathon in September.
Keeping a diary of his training on his blog, he wrote on April 1: "What a nightmare this morning was. Yesterday I did a gentle 5 miles as my breathing still not too good and knees a little achy.
"Today on the other hand my eyes were itching, nose running and breathing a big struggle, also in the office all day after the gym. Was talking to Nicola from the National Osteoporsis Society via email and she seems to think this is not hay fever but due to pollution and the dust from the Sahara. Hope so as I don't want to be running like this during the Marathon."
A week before the race he added: "Friday much better, seems Nicola was right, although I have now used my inhaler 3 times in the last week whereas I might use it 3 times in year. Today started out very slow and breathing a big struggle but it got much better as the run went on and I finished 12.5 miles feeling strong."
His website, which also documents difficulties he had with his knees, includes an interview with his mother, where she describes having limited mobility as a result of osteoporosis.
"Despite the regular pain and discomfort, with the two hip operations on bones the density of someone typically the age of 100, I am able to walk short distances and with my husband's support it is manageable," says Mrs Berry.
According to his training regime, Mr Berry had been preparing for the marathon since December. Based on previous runs, he had predicted he would complete the race in 3hrs 18mins.
Just Giving said that they would donate their normal five per cent fee to the charity as a mark of respect to Mr Berry.
An estimated 36,000 people took part in the London Marathon, from elite athletes to fun-runners raising money for charities.
