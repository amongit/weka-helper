Formula One 2015 pre-season review: Mercedes could be untouchable this year

“Unbelievably quick… miles ahead… the benchmark… in a class of their own.” None of these statements from Mercedes’ rivals were particularly encouraging if you’re hoping for an incredibly tight season at the front. Perhaps it is just an attempt to downgrade expectations, but those in the technical know, who have forensically analysed both one-lap and long-run pace suggest Mercedes could have an advantage of roughly 0.8 seconds a lap over everyone. If that’s the case, we’re in for a re-run of 2014.
But we should not be particularly aghast at the prospect. Mercedes proved they were more than capable of providing a riveting contest all by themselves, with Red Bull and the others pitching in every now and then to make things interesting. We are relying on you, Nico Rosberg, to keep Lewis Hamilton honest and push him all the way. As long Williams, Red Bull and McLaren are able to scrap for a few wins here and there, and put pressure on the Mercedes duo, then there’s no reason to be too despondent about the year ahead.

Given the build-up, the hype, the endless references to the glories of McLaren-Honda’s past, it was pretty astonishing to hear Eric Boullier admit they may not be competitive until Formula One returns to the Circuit de Catalunya for the start of the European season in May. After all, it is not as if Honda did not have years to prepare for their entry into Formula One and a year to observe and learn from all the other manufacturers.
Perhaps something was lost in translation, but Honda’s engine chief in Barcelona risked ridicule on Saturday by declaring: “Everything on the power unit is working well. Yesterday we did over 100 laps and today about 40 laps. The system itself is very good and ready to race, but we need some more practice.” That certainly raised a few eyebrows in the paddock.
The reality is, unless they can pull off a miraculous turnaround, a la Red Bull in 2014, McLaren are going to face an ignominious start to their new era. It seems likely that Fernando Alonso’s potential non-participation in Melbourne will not make a jot of difference to his championship campaign.
On the slide: Jenson Button's title hopes look forlorn

Something in the water at Mercedes
Rumours of Audi’s possible entry into Formula One have been swirling around for a good few months now. So you can only imagine the reaction of Toto Wolff, the Mercedes head of motorsport, when one mischievous journalist pointed out the team’s hospitality unit was stocking San Pellegrino water, with a big black Ducati label on it (Ducati are part of the Audi group). The supply was swiftly returned to the supermarket.

Not a Honda Civic in sight
You could understand McLaren for yearning a return to Mercedes power at the moment. The Honda power pack, despite the assertions of engine bosses, has got off to a stuttering start. One can forgive Eric Boullier, the team’s racing director, for driving in and out of the Circuit de Catalunya in a Mercedes then. He didn’t want to be late, after all. At least Boullier had a car though – Christian Horner, the Red Bull boss, could be seen scuttling around on a scooter.
Man of the people
Maurizio Arrivabene, the new Ferrari team principal, already seems to be making his presence felt. While his ill-fated predecessor, Marco Mattiacci, famously turned up in the paddock in sunglasses, in a grey smoggy China, Arrivabene has been eschewing the paddock altogether. On one day of testing he dragged the team’s reserve driver, Esteban Guttierez, into the stands with the spectators. He described it as a “provocation” to Bernie Ecclestone over plans to cut the number of paddock passes for the first race in Melbourne. Maurizio is a brave man to prod F1’s supremo…

Different perspective. Great time with the fans!! #ForzaFerrari pic.twitter.com/qbiw20Ig6L
Clearing up the Alonso situation?
A small part of me felt a little sorry for Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. There he was, doing his best to try and quash some of the ludicrous speculation around Fernando Alonso’s testing accident, and clear things up once and for all. Sadly, most left the press conference more confused than before. We were initially told Alonso had been concussed but now the opposite was true. Dennis said he foresaw no reason why Alonso would not be in Melbourne, but then added it was in the hands of the doctors who said the Spaniard’s recovery time was “unquantifiable”. Clear as mud.

After Madonna’s fall, and McLaren’s assertion that Fernando Alonso’s crash was caused by a gust of wind…

Maybe Ron’s going to tell us that Madonna’s tumble at The Brits was due to a gust of wind #F1

“Carmen [Jorda] will bring a fresh perspective to the team…. She is a unique addition to the team and we are looking forward to helping her progress her goals as well as receiving the benefit of her insights and contributions” – Matthew Carter, Lotus CEO.
The biggest response to the Jorda announcement as a ‘development driver’ was “Carmen who?” Good for Carmen, but with no points in GP3 in three seasons, and a best of 17th, you can hardly say she deserves it on merit.
