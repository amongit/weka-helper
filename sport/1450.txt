Phil Simmons has guided Ireland to six successive ICC global tournaments

Ireland coach Phil Simmons is mulling over whether to accept an offer to take charge of his native West Indies.
Trinidadian Simmons, who has led the Irish since 2007, is believed to have been interviewed for the job prior to the current World Cup.
BBC Sport has been told that Simmons, 51, has been offered the West Indies post but that negotiations have yet to be successfully concluded.
Simmons's Irish exited from the World Cup after Sunday's defeat by Pakistan.
The coach is under contract with Ireland until December but Cricket Ireland are not expected to stand in his way if he decides to accept the West Indies offer.
Born, 18 April, 1963 in Arima, Trinidad & Tobago
Makes West Indies Test debut against India, January 1988
Plays 26th and final Test against Pakistan in November, 1997
143 one-day appearances for the West Indies
Coached Zimbabwe from 2004-5
Appointed Ireland coach 2007
Guided Ireland to six successive ICC global tournaments
Ireland also won 10 Associate competitions during his tenure
A quick Simmons appointment would see him take charge for the Test series against England in the Caribbean next month.
Stuart Williams has been in temporary charge of the Windies since they parted company with Ottis Gibson last August.
Simmons, who played 26 Tests from 1988 until 1997, has been linked with the West Indies job on a number of previous occasions.
And his stock has risen further over the last month given Ireland's impressive performances at the World Cup.
Since replacing Adi Birrell after the 2007 World Cup, Simmons has guided Ireland to the 2011 and 2015 tournaments and earned wins over Test nations England, the West Indies and Zimbabwe.
Simmons's Ireland squad defeated the West Indies in their opening World Cup game in Nelson last month but missed out on a quarter-final spot on run-rate despite further group victories over the United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.
During Simmons's tenure, he has guided Ireland to six successive ICC global tournaments while his side have also won 10 trophies contested by Associate countries.
