Waves as high as 20ft have hit southern California’s beaches, damaging waterfront homes, knocking out pier pilings and attracting scores of surfing enthusiasts.
The rare conditions are a result of swells produced by Hurricane Marie in the Pacific, 800 miles west of Mexico's Baja California peninsula.

‘We wait for waves like this – when they come you’ve gotta get out there,’ keen surfer Nate Mercier said in an interview with USA Today.
Thousands of spectators lined the Wedge, a popular surf spot in Newport Beach, to watch surfboarders take on the waves, town officials said.

However, the National Weather Service in San Diego warned that "conditions are very hazardous along the entire coast with very strong rip and longshore currents occurring".
One person has died while surfing on a beach in Malibu, but it is unclear if the death was caused by the surf or a medical condition.

The swells are the largest seen in southern California since a pair of hurricanes hit the Pacific within weeks of each other in 1997, National Weather Service weather specialist Stuart Ceto said.
Wave conditions are expected to continue through Thursday despite a weakened storm.
