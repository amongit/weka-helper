16.28 Well after that late drama it's time to sign off. Please return later for the closing ceremony live blog where Kylie Minogue and Lulu will be performing. Thanks for joining us.
16.17 Thomas: "I felt terrible at the start and I thought about stopping. And then when I had that front puncture, I thought 'what have I got to do' but thankfully I had a big enough gap." Thomas will also be Wales' flagbearer at tonight's closing ceremony, which you'll be able to follow right here with Alan Tyers from 7pm.

16.14 Bauer leads Thwaites into the final bend but now the Englishman takes the lead. The duo are neck-and-neck for the finishing line, but Bauer nicks the silver, Thwaites has to settle for bronze.
16.13 Thomas is on the final straight now...and crosses the line to WIN GOLD FOR WALES.
16.10 Thomas still has a clear lead over his two rivals with 2.5kms left. That would've been so cruel if a second mechanical failure would've ended his hopes of securing gold. It looks to be a real battle for silver behind the Welshman.
16.05 DRAMA!!!!! Just as I was writing that last update, Thomas's front tyre goes, incredible, incredible stuff. He stands over his bike, stranded in the middle of the road. Thwaites and Bauer are unaware of what's going on in front of them, but should be as soon as they turn the corner. Thomas gets back away, he still has the advantage, but it's now down to 20secs.
16.03 Make that a 38sec gap now, the Welshman is flying towards the gold...and to think he had mechanical problems during that opening lap when he watched a slow engineer come to his aid and replace his rear wheel.
16.01 Thomas has an 18secs gap on Thwaites and Bauer who don't appear to have the power to reel him in with 6km left.
15.57 Thomas goes for it and makes his move on the incline. He's zipped away from Bauer and Thwaites with 11km to go.
15.53 The bell rings. We have one lap to go to determine the winner of the men's road race. Bauer takes up the lead from Thwaites and Thomas, Kennaugh remains over three minutes behind in the chasing pack with England's Downing.
15.45 The pace has started to slow over the last two laps but we're still waiting for one of the trio of Thwaites, Thomas and Bauer to make a breakaway.
15.38 Scotland's David Millar doesn't look like being one of the active competitors left to pick up one of the remaining three medals on offer in Glasgow. Millar is back in 11th spot with 24km left.
15.36 England's Peter Barker and Alison Waters have lost their squash mixed doubles final to Australia's Rachael Grinham and David Palmer 11-8, 11-10 and have to settle for silver. That leaves three medals to be decided in this edition of the Commonwealth Games.
15.32 Thwaites still leads from Bauer and Thomas as they head into the penultimate lap after 140km of action and three-and-a-half hours of cycling on the streets of Glasgow. Kennaugh is fifth, just over two minutes off the front runners.
15.21 Kennaugh is running out of fuel but is digging deep to stay in the chasing pack of three. England's Thwaites leads the front trio from Thomas and Bauer, it looks like it's just a case of sorting out the medal order.
15.10 New Zealand's Bauer leads from England's Thwaites and Wales' Thomas as they cross the line to start lap nine with just over 40kms left. There's nothing between the three riders. Australia's Ewan is a further 27secs behind the leaders. England's Downing is back in fifth, 42secs adrift.
15.05 Kennaugh, who has led pretty much from the off, has been over-taken with Bauer and Thomas going through. A commendable effort from the Manxman but I wonder if he would do things differently given another chance?

14.59 Kennaugh's legs have gone. He's struggling at the front now as Bauer and Wales' Thomas close on the leader with 50km to go.
14.53 Cavendish provides Kennaugh with another much-needed energy gel and probably gives him a word or too of encouragement. He'll need it. New Zealand's Jack Bauer who was close to a stage win at the Tour de France a couple of weeks ago, breaks from the peleton and attempts to close on the Isle of Man cyclist. Interesting, very interesting.
14.45 England's Dowsett was disappointed not to have been able to finish the men's race today. "Gutted about today, couldn't accelerate for toffee, been putting all my eggs in the time trial basket. Hopefully Russ and Scott can finish it off!" Kennaugh has completed lap seven but for the first time, his lead is under threat. The chasing pack have cut his lead to 1min 15 after 112km of racing.
14.34 Another medal for England, this time another shiny bronze one for squash men's doubles pair James Willstrop and Daryl Selby who have beaten Scotland's Alan Clyne and Harry Leitch 11-8, 11-7.
14.31 The cyclists left out there, about 25 in all now, are soaked to the bone as the 'brave' spectators huddle under their umbrellas on a delightful day in Glasgow. The team cars have all got their headlights on too as Kennaugh continues to dig deep and keep up his lead with 67km to go.
<noframe>Twitter: Tanni Grey-Thompson - Have to get ready for tonight. Need to shower and do hair but don't want to leave the road race.</noframe>
14.15 We're at the halfway stage now in the men's road race with Kennaugh still leading as the rain chucks it down...again. Australia's Michael Hepburn heads the peleton. One person with a key eye on the weather appears to be Kylie who will be performing at tonight's closing ceremony.
<noframe>Twitter: kylie minogue - Sun is out ð&Yuml;ð&Yuml;&OElig; Oh wait, it's raining â&rdquo;ï¸ Hang on, it's only drizzle ð&Yuml;&rsquo;§ No, sun is out ......<a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
14.00 The Aussies have picked up a fair few gold medals today, but it won't be enough to dislodge England at the top of the standings. After victory in the hockey in the last few minutes, the women's netball team have clinched the top gong after beating New Zealand 58-40.
13.55 Kennaugh now has completed five laps of 12 but still has 95km to go. It would be some victory if he manages to hold on. He's 1min 51secs ahead of the peleton now so is maintaining his speed. England's time-trial champion Alex Dowsett though has been forced to retire.
13.47 Australia's men's hockey team clinch gold with a 4-0 victory over India to add to their women's team success late last night.

13.41 Mark Cavendish, who couldn't compete at the Games due to injury sustained during the opening day of the Tour de France, has settled into his role as make-shift Isle of Man directeur sportif as he hands Kennaugh another energy drink as the team car rolls up alongside the current leader.
13.30 In the hockey, Australia's men team are 4-0 to the good against India with just over 15 minutes to play.
13.26 Four laps completed and Kennaugh has a 1min 49sec lead over the peleton. Thomas is back to the peleton and over 2mins off the leader.
13.21 Scotland's Millar is back in seventh spot in the peleton as Kennaugh presses on in the lead with 114km to go. Back in the field and Wales' Geraint Thomas needs a wheel change. It's hardly a quick pit stop. He won't be landing a job on a F1 team any time soon. Nevermind, he's back up and running with a fresh wheel, just has to catch up with that peleton now.
13.03 Three laps done, nine to go for Kennaugh who remains out in front of the men's road race an hour in and 42.1km completed. Australia's Dennis leads the peleton around 1.18mins behind the Isle of Man cyclist with the sunshine peeking through the clouds again. It's been four seasons in one day in Glasgow.
12.52 After that earlier mechanical fault, Wales Jon Mould has been forced to retire. It remains as you were at the front. In the men's hockey final, Australia are leading India 2-0 at half-time.
12.42 Kennaugh is still going it alone as he passes over the line to complete his second lap, 28km in. He's been leading from pretty much the get go. He takes on a much-needed energy bar. Behind him is Canada's Pelletier, a good 38secs off the pace, Australia's Deenis is back in third and Wales' Rowe fourth.
12.25 Kennaugh completed that opening lap in 20.37mins, behind him is Australia's Rohan Dennis...although a good 30 secs back. Meanwhile the men's hockey final between Australia and India is under way. Australia could do the double after their women's team beat England in a penalty shoot-out late last night to clinch gold.
12.10 The Isle of Man's Peter Kennaugh has made a surprise breakaway early doors in the opening few kms. An interesting tactic and one that the crowd enjoyed. How long can he stay out there, mind?
12.02 After Armitstead's success in the women's road race, now it's time for the men on the wet streets of Glasgow. There's disaster for Team Wales' Jon Mould has a mechanical failure down the first 100m straight. Plenty of supporters still on the streets, all sheltering under their brollies. The locals, obviously, will be hoping for a David Millar victory.
11.45 It's cagey stuff in the shoot-out. After New Zealand's Blair Hilton takes an age with his effort, Nick Catlin slots his home to put England ahead for a 3-2 lead. England will win the bronze if Ashley Jackson converts the next one. He does. ENGLAND'S MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM WIN BRONZE.
11.35 Oh dear, penalties are required to determine the winners of the bronze-medal hockey match between England and New Zealand after finishing 3-3 in normal time. England women's team lost their shoot-out late last night to the Aussies in the final. How's the men's luck today?
11.27 RESULT: England's netball team end the Games medal-less after losing their bronze-medal match 52-48 to Jamaica's 'Sunshine Girls'.

11.25 England men's hockey team are locked 3-3 with New Zealand in their bronze-medal match after Simon Child grabbed the Kiwis an equaliser for his second goal of the match. In the netball, England are trailing 50-47 with just over a minute and a half to play.
11.22 Reader Hazel Oates has emailled in her favourite moment of the Games.
It has to be seeing my daughter on the Sunday 6pm News in New Zealand supporting the Kiwis at the triathlon on a sunny Glasgow day!
11.14 Heading into the final 10 minutes of England netball's bronze-medal match with Jamaica and it's still nip and tuck at 40-40. After England lost to New Zealand with a last-gasp goal yesterday and were beaten by Australia by a single goal in the pool stages, surely they won't suffer a third unlucky defeat?
11.05 The Telegraph's Rod Gilmour has a quirky tale of two of England's husband-and-wife duos in the badminton and table tennis.
Symmetry with England's golden mixed doubles pairings. The Drinkhalls yesterday won table tennis gold and will move into a new flat tomorrow with their dog, Millie. The Adcocks, who have just won badminton gold, also have a dog, Bowser. Both pairs got married within two weeks of each other last year.
10.55 After the heartache of losing their semi-final to New Zealand in the final seconds yesterday, England's netball team are taking on Jamacia in the bronze-medal match and it's locked 30-30 in the third quarter.
10.52 I can now clear up that in the sprint for bronze in the women's road race South Africa's Ashleigh Pasio edged out Tiffiany Australia's Cromwell for third. Here's what Armitstead had to say about clinching gold. "It's special and surreal. This is something I have always dreamed about, it means so much to me. I am always a runner up.
"I am really happy. That was the best cycling teamwork I have ever been a part of. It's such a shame Emma is retiring today, it was a fantastic job from her and all the girls, I am really proud of them."
10.45 While I was concentrating on the women's road race, there was an all-English badminton mixed doubles final taking place. The champagne will be flowing in the Adcocks household tonight as Chris and Gabby Adcock have become the first husband and wife team to win the Commonwealth mixed doubles title. The Adcocks beat Chris Langridge and Heather Olver 21-9, 21-12.
10.39 Armitstead comes round the final bend with nobody in sight. She was pipped to the top gong in Delhi four years ago and at London 2012 but not here...she takes GOLD. Now it's Pooley coming down the final straight and she clinches silver in her final competitive race. Further back there's a photo finish for the bronze. ARMITSTEAD WINS GOLD, POOLEY TAKES SILVER
10.35 Cromwell makes a break for bronze from two of her Australian team-mates as Armitstead tears up the track and is surging towards gold on the greasy Glasgow streets. The rain has now stopped and Pooley is looking strong for silver with less than 2km to go.
10.28 Now Armitstead makes her move, goes round the two Australians Cromwell and Elvin, moves past Pooley and surges to the front. England could be on for a gold and silver here with 5.5km to go.
10.23 Pooley stretches the gap on Australia's Cromwell with just over 10.3km in her final competitive event before she retires from cycling and turns her hand to triathlons and marathons. Scotland's Archibald is digging deep at the back of the leading pack as the sun reappears and the rain eases.
10.16 It's chucking it down now in Glasgow as the cyclists gingerly make their way round the final bend as they cross the start line for the final lap of the women's road race. Pooley still leads from Australia's Cromwell.

10.05 Strong riding from Pooley out in front with 20.5km to race but how much energy does she have left in her legs? Archibald is starting to fall off the pace now in the leading pack as the rain starts to come down now. It had been dry for the first two hours of this race but the roads are now slightly greasy.
09.56 After 70.1km and with two laps of Glasgow's city centre to go, Pooley heads the women's road race from Australia's Elvin and Cromwell. Pooley's team-mate Armitstead is sitting handily in fourth, Scotland's Archibald is sixth with seven cyclists among the pack and all within a shout of a medal.
09.54 Here's how the medal table looks heading into today's final day of action.

09.39 There's a breakaway from Australia and England with 37km to go in the women's road race with Lizzie Armitstead and Emma Pooley the two England cyclists battling it out with Aussie rivals Tiffany Cromwell and Gracie Elvin. Scotland's Katie Archibald also breaks free from the peleton and is holding her own.
09.30 Now it's Hannah Barnes putting in the hard yards at the front for England with just over 44km to go in a tight front-pack. We've now had 14 retirements including Australian time-trial bronze medallist Katrin Garfoot.
09.20 If you missed it late last night, England came within seconds of winning gold in the women's hockey final against Australia...only to go on and lose on penalties and settling for silver.
Here Tom Cary's report on the action:
So England’s penalty shoot-out curse is not confined to football. What a way to find out. This was the pure, pure agony; the cruellest of defeats.
Seconds from their first ever Commonwealth gold, Katie Richardson-Walsh’s side were leading the previously impregnable Australia 1-0 from Lily Owsley’s expertly-taken goal midway through the second half. Then, tragedy. With 17 seconds left on the clock, England conceded from a retaken penalty corner.
Having conceded the sucker-punch, there was an air of inevitability about the outcome, a grim feeling that this would not be England’s night.
Read the full report here.
09.10 We've already had three casualties on the streets of Glasgow this morning with Team Wales' Hayley Jones the most notable. Australia are leading with Shara Gillow while Telegraph columnist and England's Laura Trott is among the chasing pack with 54kms to go.
08.45 Morning all. Welcome to day 11 coverage of the games where I bring you good and bad news. Let's start with the bad. After 10 days of action-packed drama and s**tgate controversy, the Glasgow games are drawing to a close.
The good news? Well England's gold in the 4x400m men's relay last night ensures England can not be toppled at the top of the medals table. It's the first time in 28 years England have finished top of the pile. There, take that Australia.
So we have just a few more events to bring you before we wrap up proceedings with tonight's closing ceremony which Alan Tyers will be here to take you through.
The women's road race got underway at 8am and sees Emma Pooley compete in her final competitive event before signing off her cycling career. We then have the men's road race at midday.
England are guaranteed gold and silver in the badminton mixed doubles after the Adcocks set up a final with compatriots Chris Langridge and Heather Oliver.
And in the netball, England will hope to forget the disappointment of yesterday's final seconds semi-final defeat to New Zealand as they take on Jamica in the bronze medal match.
