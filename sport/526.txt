Get Sanchez running at Carvalho
Monaco secured their 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium without three of their usual back four. The return of Ricardo Carvalho is regarded as especially significant but, while Almamy Touré is vastly less experienced, his pace was important in the first leg. Carvalho will feel confident of containing Olivier Giroud, but may be more concerned by Alexis Sánchez, Danny Welbeck or Theo Walcott running at him. Arsenal must allow their best runners to test the 36-year-old.

Contain Moutinho and Berbatov
The focus might have been on how Arsenal can score three goals but they know they will be punished if they leave either Joao Moutinho or Dimitar Berbatov too much space. Francis Coquelin is key as the one defensive midfielder but communication will be vital and, whether it is Aaron Ramsey or Santi Cazorla next to him, the attacking threats of Monaco must not be forgotten.

Gamble on attacking full-backs
One of the big problems of the first leg was how Arsenal, for all their possession, failed to create clear chances and lost their width. Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sánchez prefer to cut inside, so Monaco only had to defend the central area of the pitch. Arsenal must be cautious in how they encourage their full-backs to push forward but, in Kieran Gibbs and Hector Bellerin, they have the pace to cause Monaco problems out wide.

Be ready to use the full squad
One familiar frustration for Arsenal fans is the predictability of how Arsène Wenger uses his substitutes. The first changes rarely arrive much before the 60th minute. There is no need to panic early but, equally, Arsenal must not become predictable as they did in the first leg. Wenger has a squad brimming with attacking variation – Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott may well start on the bench – and he should be ready to surprise Monaco and change his system.
