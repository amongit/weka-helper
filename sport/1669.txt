Yao Ming Talks Shaq And His Global Effort To End Ivory Poaching
Since retiring from basketball in 2011, Yao Ming, a former No. 1 draft pick and eight-time NBA All-Star with the Houston Rockets, has dedicated his life to animal activism. The 34-year-old Ming visited with Jordan Schultz and HuffPost Live to discuss his new project, a global effort to end ivory poaching.
The 7-foot-6 Ming also discussed his comical relationship with Shaquille O'Neal, whom he called his toughest ever matchup during his decade-long career as a star center in the league.
