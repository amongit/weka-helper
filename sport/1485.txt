Tonga international prop Taione Vea is to join Newcastle from Premiership rivals London Welsh this summer.
The 26-year-old has played six times for his country, his last cap coming in a 17-7 loss to Wales in November 2013.
Vea spent the 2013-14 season at Wasps, and has scored two tries in 25 games for the bottom-of-the-table Exiles.
"I'm still learning a lot and want to get more Premiership experience so I'm looking forward to doing that at Newcastle Falcons," Vea said.
He is the fifth new signing announced by Newcastle for next season, with fellow Tongan Sonatane Takulua already recruited from New Zealand side Northland.
The club has also brought in fly-half Mike Delany, England Sevens full-back Marcus Watson and Yorkshire Carnegie prop Ben Harris.
"He's a quality prop who is a great scrummager and equally strong on the loose work too," Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards said.
"As a Tongan international he brings a powerful and skilled head to our front row, although he's also a very humble guy who I know will fit in well with our squad."
