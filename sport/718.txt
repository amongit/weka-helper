Sports Personality 2014: Who should win?

Bookmaker Coral believe that this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year is the closest it's been in years. Rory McIlroy's remarkable form in 2014 saw his odds shorten to just 1-9 for the prize, but those odds have drifted ever since Lewis Hamilton picked up the Drivers' Title in Abu Dhabi.
McIlroy is still edging ahead as the favourite to win the accolade in Glasgow on Sunday night at 4-9, but Hamilton is a very close behind at 13-8.
"In the last number of years, there has always been a clear odds-on favourite to win the award, but this year it is a different story. McIlroy may be odds-on, but Lewis Hamilton is closing the gap," said Coral's Nicola McGeady.
Odds: 4-9 Rory McIlroy, 13-8 Lewis Hamilton, 33-1 Gareth Bale, 50-1 Jo Pavey, 100-1 Charlotte Dujardin, 200-1 Carl Froch, Lizzy Yarnold, 250-1 Kelly Gallagher, 300-1 Adam Peaty, Max Whitlock.
But who do you think is the most deserved winner? Would you give it to one of the outsiders? Pavey, at 40 years old and the mother of two young children, scooped Commonwealth bronze over 5,000 metres in Glasgow before, 10 days later, winning 10,000m gold at the European Championships in Zurich. Surely that's worth a shout?
