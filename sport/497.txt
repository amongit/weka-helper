New England Patriots v Seattle Seahawks
University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona (Sunday, February 1, 11.30pm GMT)
• The two teams have identical records heading into Super Bowl – 14 wins, 4 defeats each
• Their regular-season records are also exactly the same (7-1 at home, 5-3 on the road)
• New England and Seattle have played each other 16 times – the series is tied 8-8

• Every statistical analysis puts the confrontation as the most even in living memory. As if to prove that the Super Bowl truly is decided on the flip of a coin, the winner of the pre-game coin toss has gone to win precisely 50 per cent of the time (24 out of 48).
Super Bowl records
New England – 3 wins, 4 defeats; Seattle – 1 win, 1 defeat
Historical records
• New England Patriots (established 1959): Three Super Bowls (2002, 2004, 2005), eight conference titles, 16 divisional titles, 22 play-off appearances
• Seattle Seahawks (established 1974): One Super Bowl (2014), three conference titles, nine divisional titles, 14 play-off appearances
Records
• New England: Tom Brady is the first quarterback ever to play in six Super Bowls and could join Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw as one of three who have won four. Bill Belichick is already alongside Don Shula as one of only two coaches to reach six Super Bowls. If Patriots win, he would join Chuck Noll as one of two to have four titles
• Seattle: They are seeking to become the first team to defend the Vince Lombardi Trophy since New England did it in 2005. Victory would make Russell Wilson, at 26, the youngest quarterback to hold two Super Bowl rings.
Tale of the tape
• Yards gained per game: New England, 369 (ranked 10th of 32 in league); Seattle, 374 (9th)
• Yards given up per game: New England, 349 (16th); Seattle, 273 (1st)
• Points scored per game: New England, 30 (3rd), Seattle, 25 (10th)
• Points given up per game: New England, 20 (8th), Seattle, 16 (1st)
• Rushing yards per game: New England, 102 (19th); Seattle, 168 (1st)
• Passing yards per game: New England, 266 (9th); Seattle, 206 (26th)
• Cheapest seat in the house: $800 (£530) each, face value. But some are selling on the secondary market for over £40,000 apiece
Television: The game drew a record audience of 111.5 million in 2014 (roughly one in 63 people on the planet were watching)
Alcohol: Super Bowl Sunday is America’s second most prolific day for beer consumption, just behind the Fourth of July
Adverts: When 115 million are watching across the land, competition for 30-second slots during the copious commercial breaks is intense. The cost per slot is now £3 million, up almost £300,000 on 2014.
Food: Americans are forecast to order a frankly terrifying 1.23 billion chicken wings on game day. Not forgetting 11 million pounds of nachos, as well as 158 million avocados needed for the guacamole dips. The average viewer will consume 2,400 calories worth of snacks alone, making this the nation’s most gluttonous day after Thanksgiving.
Media madness: The Boston Globe have sent 22 staff writers to Phoenix to cover the Super Bowl. The Seattle Times have sent 21. Super Bowl Media Day at the Phoenix Convention Centre required every player on both teams to be available, yet reticent Seahawks running-back Marshawn Lynch decided to give exactly the same answer to 29 different questions: “I’m just here so I don’t get fined.”
Twitter: Last year, 24.9 million tweets were sent during the course of the game
Most valuable player: Seattle linebacker Malcolm Smith has a chance to become only the third player ever to win back-to-back Super Bowl MVPs after quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw (1979 and 1980) and Bart Starr (1967 and 1968)
Half-time show: Katy Perry, the Californian pop queen, will be bringing her sassy sense of mischief to the most tightly-choreographed gig in the world. She is thought to be bringing out at least one ‘special guest’, one of whom will be Lenny Kravitz – an ambitious move for a show that is only 12 minutes long.
