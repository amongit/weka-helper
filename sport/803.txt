Jonny May for England against New Zealand in the autumn. To show that pace against that quality of opposition was quite stunning, not least because the two players he beat for pace were Conrad Smith and Israel Dagg, both of whom are world-class operators.

New Zealand’s third in the same match at Twickenham. Usually these awards go to spectacular length-of-the-field efforts – and in that regard there were two that stood out for me during England’s tour of New Zealand last summer in Ben Smith’s in Dunedin and Julian Savea’s in Hamilton – but this is different.
This was a classic wet-weather try, as the rain poured down in London and New Zealand went through 22 phases for their final try, from replacement prop Charlie Faumuina. It was so good not just because it was error-free but also because the forwards’ body angles were so technically sharp and dynamic.

Not just because it is so fresh in the mind, but I am going for Northampton versus Leicester in the Aviva Premiership last weekend. Last season’s semi-final between the two teams is up there, as is Saracens’ demolition of Clermont Auvergne in the Heineken Cup. So, too, Ireland’s two autumn wins over South Africa and Australia, but for me that match at Franklin’s Gardens was extraordinary. Down to 14 men for much of the game, Northampton’s team performance suggested anything but that. Tactically and technically it was a remarkable effort in a passionate and charged atmosphere.

New Zealand’s Richie McCaw. Call me boring if you will, but I cannot look past him. He is still part and parcel of why New Zealand win so many Tests. If you look throughout the world again this year and see which player has made the biggest difference to any team, it is McCaw and his influence upon the All Blacks. He simply makes opposition teams raise their standards if they are to stand any chance. He has captained New Zealand in 100 Tests and they have won 88. That very fact requires recognition.
South Africa’s No 8 Duane Vermeulen was the one player who might have come close – I thought he was magnificent in their victory over the All Blacks in Johannesburg – but he maybe did not quite replicate his Rugby Championship form during the autumn Tests over here.

Ireland’s Paul O’Connell. Like McCaw, another old man in rugby terms, but, also like McCaw, another man who changes a side when he is playing. It is for that reason that I wanted him to be captain of the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. He is simply a driving presence on and off the field in any team, just like Martin Johnson was for England and the Lions. His form has been consistently outstanding during the past 12 months, during Ireland’s Six Nations triumph and their unbeaten autumn series.

South Africa’s Handre Pollard. For a 20-year-old to do what he has done in the last year at fly-half is little short of amazing. Others I liked were the New Zealand centre Malakai Fekitoa and their fly-half Beauden Barrett (he is still only 23, even if he has played 28 Tests already).

Ireland’s Joe Schmidt. The obvious answer would be New Zealand’s Steve Hansen, but I think Schmidt has done a brilliant job with a side who really needed some direction, bringing that and achieving some notable success too, with a Six Nations title and that unbeaten autumn. He has got them playing a brand of quality rugby that is both physical and dynamic, while also introducing some excellent youngsters such as Robbie Henshaw, who has replaced Brian O'Driscoll at centre.
They now look like they will be a huge threat at next year’s Rugby World Cup and in the Six Nations that precedes it.

England’s George Ford. It will be fascinating to see how the fy-half pushes forward now with both Bath and England. He came through his baptism in the autumn well, but the challenges will only get bigger, especially against Wales in Cardiff in the Six Nations opener. Owen Farrell will be chasing him hard, too.

Others to keep an eye on are the Scottish brothers, Richie and Jonny Gray, at lock, who look as if they could be a hugely exciting combination. In that position New Zealand’s 21-year-old Patrick Tuipulotu and Australia’s Will Skelton are also massive prospects in more ways than one. I will also be watching the young Welsh fly-half at Leicester, Owen Williams, closely. The 22-year-old looks a really promising player. So, too, Anthony Watson on the wing at Bath and for England. He will just get better and better, I think.

Get rid of the hit at the scrummage and go back 20 years so that the front rows go down on their own first. They bind and lock, and then the back five come in afterwards with their weight. You take away the hit and the illegal drive before the ball comes in. It would be far easier for referees. Also how about a mark anywhere on the field rather than just inside the 22? That might put an end to any aimless kicking.

The greatest Rugby World Cup ever. It is important that the quality of rugby is good because of the exposure it will gain. It could really be a watershed for rugby union in this country if it does capture hearts and minds. It really could take off in a huge way.

15 Israel Folau (Australia) The X-factor of the Wallaby full-back’s attacking game just trumps Ireland’s Rob Kearney, who is so consistent, while England’s Mike Brown and New Zealand’s Israel Dagg had their periods when they were top-notch.
14 Ben Smith (New Zealand) So classy, a genuine footballer.
13 Tevita Kuridrani (Australia) Raw power edges out New Zealand’s Conrad Smith, who is one of my favourite players.
12 Matt Toomua (Australia) So close with South Africa’s Jean de Villiers, but I go for Toomua’s play‑making skills alongside Kuridrani. Jamie Roberts, of Wales, deserves a mention.
11 Julian Savea (New Zealand) Powerhouse try-scoring machine. Wales’s George North had his moments.
10 Jonathan Sexton (Ireland) The fly-half was instrumental in Ireland’s magnificent year with his control and composure.
9 Aaron Smith (New Zealand) Quality runner, kicker and distributor.
1 Marcos Ayerza (Argentina) World’s best loosehead.
2 Agustin Creevy (Argentina) An excellent year was capped by his inspirational performance in the victory against France in Paris.
3 Owen Franks (New Zealand) Difficult not to have one Kiwi in the front row.
4 Brodie Retallick (New Zealand) World Rugby’s player of the year and you can see why.
5 Paul O’Connell (Ireland) A phenomenal year. New Zealand’s Sam Whitelock was pretty good, too.
6 Peter O’Mahony (Ireland) Just beats New Zealand’s Jerome Kaino and South Africa’s Marcell Coetzee. A wonderfully abrasive and effective year.
7 Richie McCaw (New Zealand, capt) First name on the sheet. No questions, no debate. Australia’s Michael Hooper is the next best.
8 Duane Vermeulen (South Africa) New Zealand’s Kieran Read is obviously very close.
