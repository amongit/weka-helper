Having lost the 2010, 2011 and 2013 Australian Open finals, Andy Murray was looking to go one better in 2015.
His opponent on Sunday, Novak Djokovic, was a four-time champion, having lifted the title in Melbourne in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013, as well as being a beaten finalist in 2014.
It was an enthralling contest, particularly in the opening two sets, both of which went to a tie-breaks.
Djokovic won the first set tie-break 7-5 for the early advantage.
The second set was littered with compelling rallies and it seemed inevitable that it would require another tie-break to settle it.

Andy Murray says women can coach. But did he mean it?
It was Murray who came out on top this time, 7-4.
The Scot seemed to be in the ascendancy as he took an early 2-0 lead in the third set and Djokovic appeared to be struggling with cramp.
But the Serb found his stride again and won six of the next seven games to clinch the set 6-3.
Djokovic continued his dominance in the fourth set; the world number one coasted to a 6-0 success and sealed a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 win in three hours and 40 minutes.
It was the world number one's eigth Grand Slam title, and fifth Australian Open title, only Roy Emerson, with six, has won more.
