Leeds Rhinos left Zak Hardaker out of their team for Friday's Super League game at Warrington after confirming he is involved in a police investigation.
England full-back Hardaker, 23, and Leeds team-mate Elliot Minchella, 19, are expected to be interviewed by police over the alleged assault of a 22-year-old man in Leeds on 3 February.
Hardaker had been named in the initial 19-man squad for Friday's match.
The club said both were "co-operating fully" with the investigation.
Their statement read: "The club have been made aware of an incident in which it is alleged that Leeds Rhinos players Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved.
"Both the club and the individuals concerned are co-operating fully with the police investigation.
"Until such time as that investigation is concluded neither the club nor the players involved are able to make any further comment."
A police spokesman said: "We can confirm that we will be speaking to two men in connection with the incident."
