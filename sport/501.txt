An advert highlighting the problem of domestic violence will be seen by a more than 100 million US television viewers during the Super Bowl.
The slot has been taken out by No More, a group campaigning against spousal abuse and comes after a year in which several leading stars have been accused of domestic violence,
Even though American football is a testosterone-charged sport, administrators were put on the defensive after a series of incidents.
The highest profile case involved Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens running back who knocked his fiancée out cold in a lift at New Jersey casino.
He belatedly received an indefinite ban, but only after footage of the incident was posted on the TMZ showbusiness website.

That was followed by the indictment of Adrian Petersen, a running back with the Minnesota Vikings – and one of the game’s biggest stars – for hitting his four year old son with a stick.
Then another player, Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers, was dropped after being found guilty of assaulting his girlfriend.
NFL administrators did announce a series of initiatives to tackle the problem, but critics said it was too little, too late.
Roger Goodell, the NFL Commissioner’s handling of the Ray Rice affair in particular came under severe criticism.
Not only was he condemned for being too soft on Rice, but when he did take draconian action, Mr Goodell was attacked by the victim of the original assault – by then the player’s wife.
It led to calls for his resignation with support growing for Condoleezza Rice, the former Secretary of State and a lifelong Cleveland Browns fan, to take over as Commissioner.
