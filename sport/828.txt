Stuart Lancaster has compared England’s bid to win the RBS Six Nations title in the final match against France on Saturday to the the final day of a Ryder Cup and insisted his side would handle the pressure of chasing a large points total to win their first championship since 2011.
England go into the final round of matches with the advantage of knowing what they need to do to, with title rivals Ireland, who face Scotland at Murrayfield, and Wales, who travel to Rome to take on Italy, both playing before the kick-off at Twickenham.

England have a points-difference advantage of four over Ireland and 25 over Wales and Lancaster said his side were ready to ramp up the pressure on misfiring France, who also have an outside chance of the title if they can win by eight points at Twickenham and Ireland and Wales both lose.

Lancaster, who has made just one change to his starting line-up with Geoff Parling replacing Dave Attwood in the second row, said the potential drama of the staggered kick-offs was unique.
“The only scenario I can think of that is similar is the final day of the Ryder Cup when you’re ahead or behind when the singles are coming,” said Lancaster, who also promoted Nick Easter to the bench with Attwood dropping out of the squad.
“It’s that sort of feeling, so it will tell us a lot about the players, but it is a pretty unique situation as well.”

Asked if he backed his squad to deliver, Lancaster said: “Yes, definitely. Last year the pressure was to go to Italy and score 50. We did that.
“We’re in the same situation where we need to get as many points as possible and I think the first 60 minutes of the Dublin performance aside, we’ve shown more consistency in attack than any other team.
“France have a six-day turn-around and we know from two years ago when we played Italy on the Sunday and had to play on the Saturday – that six-day turnaround does hurt you and when you have to travel as well.
“And you have got those last 20 minutes of the game to get through. If we keep the intensity high then hopefully we can make them feel the pressure.”
