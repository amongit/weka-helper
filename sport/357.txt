Wrestling dropped from 2020 Olympics and will vie with softball and squash for place when IOC reconvene

The decision to cut wrestling, which first appeared in the ancient Olympics in 708BC, was taken by the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne on Tuesday.
It reduces the number of summer sports to 25, to which one more will be added later this year.
Squash, a joint baseball/softball bid and rock climbing are the leading contenders to take the spot vacated by wrestling, although the IOC will also consider karate, wakeboarding, wushu (a Chinese martial art) and roller sports at a meeting in St Petersburg in May.
Wrestling will be demoted after Rio 2016, when it has already been agreed that golf and rugby sevens will both be added to the programme.
Telegraph Sport understands wrestling lost its status because of a perceived lack of television appeal and the failure of the sport’s governing body to recognise it was under threat.

Where modern pentathlon and taekwando, who were also at risk, fought effective lobbying campaigns within the IOC, wrestling could not mobilise key powerbrokers with the ear of influential International Olympic Committee members.
It scored highly in regards to Olympic tradition, having been part of every modern Games apart from 1900, and in terms of the broad group of nations who compete: 71 countries were represented at the 2012 Games across the freestyle and Greco-Roman disciplines.
The world wrestling federation, Fila, said in a statement that it was astonished by the move and called the decision an aberration.
“Fila will take all necessary measures to convince the IOC executive board and IOC members of the aberration of such [a] decision against one of the founding sports of the ancient and modern Olympic Games,” it said.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: “It was up to the executive board members to make a decision, it was not black and white and it was not an easy decision, but we wanted to allow room for the renewal of the Olympic programme. This is not what’s wrong with wrestling, it’s what’s right about the other 25 core sports.”
Supporters of some of the potential new sports were also actively campaigning against the dropping of taekwondo because the natural replacement would be karate, or possibly wushu.
The backlash against the axing of wrestling has been fierce. In Iran, wrestling is the national sport. Iranian Olympic Committee president Mohammad Aliabadi said he was sending an immediate complaint to the IOC. “This will be a huge blow to our country’s sports,” he said.
The impact to UK sport will not be as profound as in other parts of the world like the US and Japan. British Wrestling chief executive Colin Nicholson said the decision was a surprise and very disappointing but was hopeful the IOC would change its mind later in the year.
“It is very disappointing, however it is not a final decision and we would hope to be added back in September,” he said. “The Olympics is the highest goal our athletes have but if it is cut they can look to the Commonwealth Games.”
UK Sport decided not to fund British Wrestling’s top two female wrestlers who are world- ranked, Olga Butkevych, originally from Ukraine, who won a bronze in the 2012 World Championships, after an 11th placing at the London Olympics, and Yana Stadnik.
Sport England has awarded wrestling £850,000 over the next four years to build its grassroots support.
There is enormous enthusiasm for wrestling at school level, and administrators are concentrating on boosting coaching numbers to deal with the demand.
The full session of the IOC has to sign off on the changes when it meets in Buenos Aires in September.
Sports that could earn a place at 2020 Games Softball / baseball Both were dropped from the London 2012 programme because of drugs issues in baseball and gender bias in softball. Hot favourite to be reinstated now the two sports have pitched a combined bid.
Squash Engaged in an expensive but effective lobbying campaign. It is also addressing the colour of the ball which currently causes broadcast problems. Fast paced.
Rock climbing Gaining solid momentum as it is seen as a progressive sport to attract viewers of all ages, but needs to have a solid base of international competitions.
