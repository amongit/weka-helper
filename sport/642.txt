An imposter posing as a former Pakistan cricket star duped the BBC into paying him repeatedly to appear on shows.
Nadeem Alam posed as ex-batsman Nadeem Abbasi to give his “expert” opinion on BBC World News, BBC Asian Network and Radio Five Live, despite only ever playing cricket for his home town of Huddersfield.
He even took part in a discussion with former Indian batsman Aakash Chopra.
Mr Abbasi, is furious about the fraudster's deceit, and has decried the BBC for failing to check its facts.
He told The Sun: “If I ever find Nadeem Alam, I will punch him in the face for damaging the country's reputation.
“The BBC is a big institution and surely they must check?”
The 46-year-old, who now coaches a team in Rawalpindi, said that his only media appearance was on Pakistani television during the World Cup in 1996.
Mr Alam told the Sun that he is “no longer pretending to be Nadeem Abbasi”, adding: “I like to think I have been talking good cricket.”

A BBC spokesman said: "We apologise to the real Mr Abbasi and we will be looking seriously into what has happened."
