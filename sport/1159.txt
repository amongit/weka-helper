Email us at olympics@telegraph.co.uk to get in touch.
We want your thoughts on the latest issues surrounding the London 2012 Olympics, your ideas on how we should celebrate the Olympics, stories you have about the Games or images you have of the way British public are celebrating.
There have been arguments over money, the countdown clock has stopped, venues have been completed and credit cards have been declined.
How do you feel the preparation for the Games are going? Is London on track to put on the "best show on earth"? Or do you think build-up has been chaotic?
We want to know what you think about the issues of the day by emailing us with your view and sending over the best links, pictures and videos to aid your argument.
The best mails will be printed in a weekly round-up, so if you've got an opinion have your say by emailing the Telegraph's Olympics desk at olympics@telegraph.co.uk
