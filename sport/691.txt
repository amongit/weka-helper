Six Nations 2015 review of the weekend - Will we ever see Owen Farrell in a No 10 shirt for England again?

Far from wondering when Danny Cipriani might get a decent run from the bench in the fly-half slot, the more pertinent question is: where does Owen Farrell's future lies.
The Saracen is currently sidelined until at least April with a knee injury picked up against Clermont Auvergne in January. There was a time when his loss would have been felt most keenly. And yet his name is hardly mentioned such has been the impact of George Ford in the shirt.

The pair are best mates from a long time back, competitive too, so Farrell will not take the view that Ford is now nailed-on to be England's starting fly-half at the Rugby World Cup lying down. He will fight hard to re-establish himself. Yet the evidence from Saturday's Calcutta Cup was compelling.
Ford had a bumpy ride in Dublin, along with many other England players, and, up against Johnny Sexton, looked the novice that he is. A compare and contrast between Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium on Saturday shows you just how fickle such sweeping judgements can be. Ford prospered while Sexton struggled.
England made a dozen line-breaks in the game (and finished few) and Ford was instrumental in creating many of them. He sets up camp on the gain line, varying his passes wonderfully well, and makes things happen. His try early in the second-half summed him up: he read the play, delayed his decision and had the nerve as well as the pace to take full advantage. He is here to stay. - Mick Cleary

HERO OF THE WEEKEND
Leigh Halfpenny (Wales)

Scotland's Stuart Hogg had a better all-round game at Twickenham at 15 than Halfpenny did in Cardiff, but the Toulon full-back's five nerveless penalties from five attempts were the difference between Wales and Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, ending Irish dreams of a Six Nations Grand Slam and blowing the title race wide open in the process. Superb under pressure.

TRY OF THE WEEKEND

England were profilgate against Scotland, but Ford's second-half score, orchestrated by Ben Youngs, was a mesmerising example of how potent Stuart Lancaster's side can be, as sharp hands allowed him a clear run to the line.

England don't do open rugby - and it goes wrong when they try
On reflection should we really worry too much? England were hopefully inaccurate and imprecise against Scotland on Saturday, but they were playing a game that will surely bear little relevance to the one they will utilise in a Rugby World Cup. That is my view anyway, even if the romantics do not seem to agree.
That is because England just seem so uncomfortable playing that all-court game. They are much happier when playing to narrower confines, as against Wales and Australia recently. It is no crime. And you can move through the phases once in the opposition's 22, where you can use strike runners like Jonathan Joseph.

Attacking from deep just does not suit England. They become too slapdash and loose, and I am not sure they have the finishers, Joseph apart, to bring just rewards to such movement anyway. Depending on results next Saturday, they may have to open out against France to make up on points difference, but again do not read too much into it.
The RWC Pools will be very different, and especially England's, where beating Wales and Australia is all that will matter. Bonus points will be awarded but they should not concern England in the first instance.
Tight, accurate game plans will be key, as in those victories over both Australia and Wales this season, two victories those now saying that England will not make it out of their RWC Pool would do well to recall. - Steve James

VILLAIN OF THE WEEKEND

The English official struggled to communicate with both captains in Cardiff, as they repeatedly queried his refereeing of the breakdown, and his decision to award Wales a scrum penalty in the dying seconds as Ireland powered forward was mystifying.

Why does Lancaster have no faith in Cipriani?
It was a sighting highly-prized by Twickenham's twitchers: that of the lesser-spotted Cipriani. Truly, it was a take-a-beer-break-and-you would-miss-it moment, as the rarely-glimpsed fly-half was afforded the most fleeting run-out at the culmination of a match already won. Three minutes after taking over from Mike Brown, he found himself back in the hutch.
There is a mounting sense that Stuart Lancaster simply does not trust Cipriani. Increasingly in this Six Nations, the No 10 is assuming the role of a meaningless replacement. He was not used at all against Ireland in Dublin, and only thrown on to face Scotland once England had stretched their lead to more than a converted try.

Why did Lancaster even bother calling him up to the squad, then? Cipriani had proved through his graft at Sale, and despite the circus of his off-field life, that he was worthy of restoration to the international fold. He made good early on the gesture of faith, scoring a try against Italy. But ever since he has been a peripheral, discarded figure, casting further doubt over Lancaster's options in finding an understudy for Ford come the World Cup.
The suspicion grows that Cipriani was included for the Six Nations purely as a populist move. - Oliver Brown
