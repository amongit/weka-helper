Mesut Ozil has been criticised for swapping shirts with a Monaco opponent as he walked off the pitch at half-time in Arsenal's Champions League last 16 tie.
The Germany international had a quiet first half at Stade Louis II and risked sparking a backlash among Arsenal fans after swapping shirts with Geoffrey Kondogbia as the sides made their way into the changing rooms at half-time.

Ozil appeared to be asked for his shirt, rather than asking for Kondogbia's, but his behaviour was immediately criticised by former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, who was working as a pundit for ITV.

He said: "I don't like it - at the end of the game, maybe. But I'm not a big fan even then.

"You do it once you're in the tunnel or once you're in the dressing room, out of the way of everyone. At half-time, it's not for me."
This is not the first time an Arsenal player has been criticised for swapping a shirt at half-time.

Former defender Andre Santos was fiercely criticised for asking for his former teammate Robin van Persie's shirt at half-time in the club's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United in 2012.
