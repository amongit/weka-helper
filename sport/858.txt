16.03 That's just about it from today's live-blog, fans. Kick-off in Cameroon vs Mexico is only an hour away. You can join my colleague Alan Tyers who will be bringing you the best of the action.
I'll be back in the chair tomorrow to cast an eye of Colombia vs Greece and Uruguay vs Costa Rica and when we can talk all about what happened in Karate Kick - The Sequel.
England v Italy: as it happened
Colombia v Greece: as it happened
Uruguay v Costa Rica: as it happened
Ivory Coast v Japan: as it happened
Happy World Cupping!
15.50 It's nearly time to hang-out with Henry. He's just snapped this image of the Manaus pitch which is looking greener and less sandy than the last time we saw it...but you know, still bad.

<noframe>Twitter: Henry Winter - Arena Amazonia pitch only slightly better today. Still not <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23WorldCup" target="_blank">#WorldCup</a> standard <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23eng" target="_blank">#eng</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ita" target="_blank">#ita</a> <a href="http://t.co/ZpIou9h3Br" target="_blank">http://t.co/ZpIou9h3Br</a></noframe>
15.37 If, following that opening ceremony, Brazil 2014 already feels like some dystopian commercially fuelled Brave New Word Cup nightmare to you, then you'd be right.
Even if you managed to stay sober, it was terrifying. Babb have all the non-doctored photovisual proof for the strangest things that happened on opening night...

15.28 It's time to get in the mood to get behind England. Yes we have to do it, please try.
For some elite level discussion of Roy's boys chances then join Henry Winter for his weekly hang-out which this week takes place from jungly Manaus. Henry will be joined by European football writer James Horncastle and Patrick Nathanson from 4pm. Go and keep them all company.
15.09 A ludicrously smiley Wayne Rooney is charming the punters in Thailand if these pics are anything to go by. He should do it more often, suits him.


Cheer up the rest of you. Gosh, it's the World Cup for heaven's sake!

14.53 There are a mere five hours between now the start of the biggest match in the World Cup, until the next one - Spain vs Netherlands.
If you want the low-down on both sides, here's a cheat sheet for your perusal. No, that's not a reference to Nigel de Jong. It's a wittily composed fictional conversation between a man and the interweb.
Just read it will you.

14.40 Joe Cole, yes remember him, well he says England can and will win the World Cup. His logic, that the current squad are "not pivotal players in the big squads in the country."
This is great news thinks Joe, because come the next World Cup "they'll all be established and there'll be a massive load of expectation on them."
"For me, looking from the outside, all the stars seem to be aligning" he says.
Here's Ossie Ardilles shooting fish in a barrel him down.

14.25 After the +Teamgeist, the Fevernova and the Jabulani comes the BRAZUCA. No it's not veruca cream, it's a football.
Investigative journalist JJ Bull takes a look at the spherical object that will dominate our affections for the next 31 days.

For the record, Japan and Korea in 2002 was utterly forgettable, all apart from this beauty that is:

14.10 If you fancy a flutter on any of today's three games, Betfair have some handy pointers on where the money's going.
Mexico v Cameroon – The group's two will be desperate to bank some points in what could be a very tight game. Betfair report some big wagers on Mexico with one punter having £20k on at 6-5.
Spain v Netherlands – Spain may well be up there with Brazil as tournament favourites, but Dutch have been well supported. Betfair have trimmed them to 4-1 from 9-2 for tonight's game.
Chile v Australia – At 15-2 Betfair report Australia’s odds have gone on walkabout, absolutely friendless in the betting are the Roos’. Poor guys.
13.53 Some semi World-Cup related transfer news to bring you: Arsenal and France defender Bacary Sagna has agreed to join Qatar's Manchester City. Sagna, whose contract expired this summer, will sign a three-year deal.
He follows in the steps of fellow Frenchman Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri who have made the move from the Emirates to the Emirate.
13.47 Speaking of the Germans, they've had the misfortune of being drawn in the Group of Death. Every tournament has one.
My colleague Thom Gibbs, whose wit and timing I can only hope to aspire to, explains all.

13.22 The Germans. Where ist ze Germans?? The Mannschaft aren't due to play their first game in Group G 'til Monday. THREE WHOLE DAYS AWAY.
Back home, German fans have been living up to some cruel national stereotypes by setting up this well-ordered, highly practical football-watching situation involving sofas in an empty stadium.
Rumours have been circulating that beach towels were placed on the sofas months before kick off last night, but we can neither confirm nor deny them right now. But Babb might know.

13.10 The World Cup's not all fun and games, especially not this year where Brazilians have been making themselves vocal on the streets as well as in the stadiums.
This sobering image has been doing the rounds on Twitter summing up much of the grievances of many about hosting the world's biggest sporting tournament in a country that still faces entrenched social and economic challenges.

12.58 Earlier, I bought you the news that Ronaldo had a bit of an iffy training session with Portugal, limping around with an ice-pack on his leg.
The training session was most notable however, for the One Direction fever which hit Ronaldo and co. Young children screaming everywhere. Loudly. One even ran onto the pitch but was love-bombed by a gentleman in a Beatles t-shirt. Scenes.



12.46 We've got Cahil. The Italians have got Pirlo. Pir-lo. The two most sumptuous syllables in language football.
I was tasked by Babb to come up with 37 reasons Andrea is the most magnificent living man to have graced a football pitch.
I know, only 37! Killjoys...
12.37 I've always thought of Gary Cahill as one of those footballers who belies the secret belief of some that we should take footballers seriously, as intellectuals, social commentators, wise men whose prowess off the pitch should not be belittled.
So here's Gaz delivering his platitudes before Italy below:

12.11 An update from our Swiss World Cup watcher Paul Knott, who's sniffed a Nostradamus in the Alpine ranks:
"I am not sure what he overheard in the bar before the first game but Swiss journalist Simon Meier of 'Le Matin' has launched an early bid for sage of the tournament.
He predicted that the first refereeing scandal of the World Cup would come on opening night "with a Brazil victory needed to start the party, they will be able to count on a boost from the man in black".
In case anyone is interested in a trip to the bookies, Simon also says that the Selecao will win the trophy and England and Switzerland will exit in the first round."
More referee lols to be had here:

11.27 Tonight's Spain vs Holland grudge match is being known colloquially as 'Karate Kick Part Two'.
To prove that he's completely, totally over it, common assault victim Xabi Alonso has featured in a special set of pics that show he's ready to forgive and forget.


The images are released by Adidas who have delightfully "re-created the famous kick to the chest Alonso suffered at the hands of Nigel De Jong in the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ final."
Still, Alonso's having the last laugh.
“It may have hurt to have been kicked in the chest, but the pain meant nothing when I was celebrating winning the trophy for Spain. The World Cup is not a time to think about such things. The pain is temporary, the victory is forever.”
11.02 Today's first match kicks off at 5pm, with Mexico and Cameroon aiming to fight it out for third place in the group win the World Cup.
Our Paul the Ocotopi at Babb have simulated the whole game for you, lucky devils.

10.39 I've always wondered how managers stave off the boredom while their players are out and about running through cones and doing strange training warm-up exercises for hours on end.
Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque has found a novel way to entertain himself as this secret footage uncovered by Project Babb sees him doing lots and lots of headers while his players run along none the wiser.
Roy Hodgson take note:

10.30 Quickie round-up of the world's front-pages. Gold star if you can spot the Croatian rag




10.14 Another day, another injury scare. Ronaldo was seen with an ice-pack strapped firmly to his leg in Portugal training yesterday. The Real Madrid man didn't complete the full session with the rest of the team.

Read more HERE.
09.56 The Croatian equivalent of the FA are holding this up as 'Modric congratulates Marcelo'. Looks to me as if only of them is pleased about the situation...

Luka Modri? congratules his Real Madrid teammate Marcelo after #BRACRO. Congrats to @CBF_Futebol! pic.twitter.com/o7Ky1o72DI
09.41 England will be holding their first training session in Manaus today, but the big news from the Italy squad is that left-back Mattia De Sciglio is out of the match. Prandelli may have to turn to the literal 24th man in the squad, Andrea Ranocchia to fill in.
In other news, bright spark Gary Neville is helping to light the way for England in the Amazon jungle, says Henry Winter, with total disregard for the danger posed by forest fires.
09.32 Fashion faux pas's are ten-a-penny with footballers. Dispropotionate headphones, too much denim, Ronaldo's studded Claire's Accessories back-packs etc etc.
So the stylish part of the Telegraph offices have put together their fashion foobtall fantasy XI.
Warning: features Cara and Zlatan in the same place...

09.15 Lots of plaudits for Croatia today after they put in a more than respectable performance in a game where all eyes where on the favourites. A couple of seasons at Real Madid have done wonders for Luka Modric, who is looking the part already.
But plenty of stick for the Japanese referee for a dubious penalty decision and another dubious ruling out of a Croatia goal after an alleged foul by Ivica Olic.
Cue the inevitable...

09.00 Greetings World Cup fans.
I like to think of today as the first bona fide day of the tournament. We're all still suitably reeling from the J-Lo-Pitbull-Other Brazilian singer melee, which however entertaining the match was, is still etched indelibly as the abiding memory of this year's World Cup so far.
But that will all change tonight. Mexico and Cameroon will be providing the hors d'oeuvres before SPAIN VS NETHERLANDS. And we've got Australia and Chile for desert.
The footballing Gods have been kind to us this year, serving up 2010's final on Day Two. It should be something of a grudge match too. From what I remember, the game four years ago was made up of lots of hacking down of diminutive Spaniards who just wanted to play the game and express themselves. And then that karate kick thing happened. Spain won. Football came through in the end. Now I think about it, it's much like that Nike disney-ish ad that I'm already sick of seeing.
If you just can't wait to find out what will happen tonight, the boffins at Project Babb have managed to re-create the highlights of tonight's game frame-by-frame before they happen. That's the Telegraph - always first with all the news.
