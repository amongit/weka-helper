Ashley Jackson warms up for Hockey India League with goals ... at ice hockey outfit Invicta Dynamos

A stint on the ice is hardly the ideal preparation for the heat of the Hockey India League, but it clearly mattered little to Ashley Jackson, who turned his hand to ice hockey with the greatest of ease when he signed for Invicta Dynamos over the Christmas period.
Jackson carved out a four-week spell in the rink for the Kent-based side, who play in the National Ice Hockey League, after returning from England’s campaign on the field at the Champions Trophy last month.
In India, he netted his 111th international goal to break Calum Giles' international record before the East Grinstead midfielder continued his scoring spree for the Dynamos in the rough and tumble of southern division one, with four in eight games.
“Not a great deal of field hockey attributes actually translate to ice hockey despite the apparent similarity which made his achievements all the more impressive,” Dynamos’ head coach, Kevin Parrish, told Telegraph Sport.
“However, you could instantly see his hand control is excellent and his vision is equally good.

“Despite his reputation in field hockey he arrived without any ego or pretentiousness and quickly became one of the guys in the changing room. He’s a natural athlete and has that hunger that only the best athletes have – he’d rather be putting in the hours to improve his performance than toasting a victory.”
Jackson laced up for the Dynamos, who currently lead the southern division, to take on teams such as Solent Devils, London Raiders and Milton Keynes Thunder. Judging by one of his goals, Jackson's month-long contributions for the Gillingham outfit were filled with his usual concoction of stick craft and invention.
It was enough for Parrish to admit that he would take the 27-year-old back “in a heartbeat” after the England star was first confirmed on the Dynamos' roster following Britain's fourth-place finish at London 2012.

“It’s impossible to predict where he could have ended up had he chosen the ice hockey route,” added Parrish. “He’s a superb athlete, the perfect professional and if he had been able to devote as much time to ice hockey as he has field hockey then I’m sure he would have honed his skills even further.
"Who knows, he could perhaps have been making a name for himself in this country’s Elite League.”
Jackson, one of five nominees for the FIH world hockey player of the year award, has had a penchant for the ice ever since he was a junior, while his uncle and grandfather both played the sport.
“I came back from India, had a look and had the chance to jump back on the ice and have a knock around with some old pals and it turned into what it has,” he told Kent Sport News.

“There’s not much that goes between the one sport and the other, just hand-eye co-ordination and I’ve been more worried about tripping over my own skates."
Jackson will now return to his day job where he will play for Ranchi Rays in the Hockey India League over the next month. He will then focus on a key six months, with Olympic qualifying and the European Championships, in London, both taking place.
