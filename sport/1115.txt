US Open 2014 predictions

Miguel Angel Jimenez (Spain) Even the immigration officials are nice to Jimenez. I watched one of them fawn over the Spaniard this week, before reverting to Lee Van Cleef mode for the rest of us. The 50 year-old finished fourth at the Masters, won the Spanish Open the next week and finished fifth in Austria on Sunday. Bookmakers seem to be the only ones who do not like Jimenez.

Paul Casey (England) The English focus will fall on the US Open defending champion Justin Rose, with Ian Poulter doing his level best to grab some of the spotlight. But it could just be that Casey, the forgotten man of English golf, provides the country's biggest challenge. The former world No 3 has put together a string of top 25 performances in America in the last few months and certainly has the talent.
100-1 Paddy Power
Rose determined to avoid suffering a World Cup ‘own goal’
Campbell a classic victim of his own success
Tragic hero Stewart still casts spell over Pinehurst
McIlroy to play safe at US Open
Mickelson desperate to break US Open curse
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angel Cabrera (Arg) A former US Open winner is another who the bookies routinely underestimate. Cabrera will go out there and take every shot on and, if it comes off, then he will be in contention once again. The players need an unflappable temperament in this, the toughest major, and Cabrera's temperament happens to flap as much as an emu in a straitjacket.

Shane Lowry (Irl) The USGA has some fun when deciding on their groupings and it is fair to say the trio of Brendon De Jonge, Kevin Stadler and Lowry were put together because of their waste measurements. Lowry is a serious player, however, as he underlined when running Rory McIlroy close at Wentworth. Has the touch around the greens and could well figure.
150-1 Betfair
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victor Dubuisson (Fr) Remember the Frenchman's two miracle saves out of the scrubland in the final of the WGC Match Play in February? Well, there are plenty of native areas here when the golden touch will be required. Ranked 20th in the world, Dubuisson has overcome a shoulder problem and his second place in Sweden two weeks ago has restored his confidence. Interesting.
90-1 Stan James
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brandt Snedeker (US) Has suffered a torrid year thus far, with only one top 10. But the American says "it feels really close" and, if he can recover his long-game sufficiently, then his short-game can do the rest. Perhaps only Luke Donald is a better putter and with such a premium on the flat stick on greens, which Jack Nicklaus calls "the toughest I've seen", Snedeker's odds could be very generous.
100-1 Stan James
