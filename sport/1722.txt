Mo'ne Davis Plays For Globetrotters, Is Her Usual Awesome Self
Little League pitching phenom Mo'ne Davis has made it no secret that she wants to play college basketball someday -- for the Connecticut Huskies in particular.
On Sunday, in her hometown of Philadelphia, she gave a glimpse of perhaps hoops stardom to come, playing for the Harlem Globetrotters, and hitting an NBA three-pointer and a layup.
Granted, the Globetrotters' perennial punching bag, the Washington Generals, didn't play much defense, but that's still pretty good marksmanship for a 13-year-old.

Davis, the first female pitcher to win a Little League World Series game, has ridden her fame to other high-profile hoop moments. She recently signed an autograph for Golden State Warriors star guard Stephen Curry and got to show off her moves in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game.
All that and a wicked fastball, too.
H/T For The Win
