Wales v Ireland
The match to decide where the championship heads. Should Ireland win, a Grand Slam seems inevitable with only Scotland to come. But should Wales win, that opens up the possibility that they and England can challenge Ireland for the title.
Wales have improved after defeat to England with victories over Scotland and France, while Irelandâ€™s simple but utterly effective game plan has given them victories over Italy, France and, most impressively, England in the last round of matches.

England v Scotland
Scotland have not won at Twickenham since 1983 (there was a draw in 1989) so this is the perfect opportunity for England to restore confidence after their demoralising defeat in Dublin last time out.
For Scotland it is the last place they would want to visit after losing at home to Italy, their third loss after defeats to France and Wales. So much for the bright new era under Vern Cotter.

Italy v France
France have lost on their last two visits to Rome, even if they have only lost four matches from 65 in total between the two countries.
Italy are buoyed by their remarkable, last-gasp victory at Murrayfield, having lost to Ireland and England, while France are smarting after a home loss to Wales, who out-powered them, making it only the one victory over Scotland in the tournament, after also losing to Ireland.
Coach Philippe Saint-Andre has made eight changes for France, even if four of them are injury-induced.
