BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Star forward Arielle Roberson won't return for her senior season after missing last year with a torn ACL in her left knee.
Coach Linda Lappe said Roberson will graduate with her class in May with a bachelor's degree in communication.
Roberson also missed her freshman year in 2010-11 with a torn labrum in her left hip. She averaged 12.0 points and 7.3 rebounds in 64 career games for the Buffaloes.
