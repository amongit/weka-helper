Andy Murray the last-minute rescue act to give spectators show after Roger Federer pulls out of ATP Tour Final

Andy Murray was sitting at his home in Oxshott, playing the video game Mario Kart, when the phone rang. Just over an hour and a half later he was walking into the O2 Arena as the replacement charged with saving the day.
Huge credit for Murray for taking up the invitation at a moment’s notice and jumping straight into his car.
Especially as none of those who participated in the exhibition – which started with Murray losing 8-5 in a “Superset” against Novak Djokovic and continued with a creaky legends doubles match – took any payment for their efforts.
“People will say many things about athletes and on Andy in particular people can be very critical about things over the years,” Chris Kermode, the ATP’s executive chairman said.
“But he has a fundamental responsibility for tennis and an acknowledgement that people are paying money to come to see something. He was straight in.”

Murray’s first reaction was to think that Kermode was winding him up, but he produced some entertaining all-court tennis and might even have had a chance to try out a few tactical variations. He also came up with a nice line in dry humour when he was interviewed on the court by Mark Petchey.
“I have to apologise because clearly I pushed Roger [Federer] too hard on Thursday,” said Murray, who is all too aware that he won only a single game in that 55-minute blowout.
In the doubles match, Murray was partnered by John McEnroe, who said earlier this year that he would be interested in the possibility of coaching a top player.
At one point, the two of them could be seen discussing the appropriate technique for a backhand slice. If Amélie Mauresmo happened to be watching on television, she might have felt a touch insecure about her job prospects for next year.
