Skipper Ken Read’s crew punched the air when they crossed the finish line after the short eight mile race which brought the curtain down on a marathon nine month event comprising nine ocean legs and ten inshore races.
The win gave Puma overall victory in the in port series by the tiny margin of one point over Chris Nicholson’s Camper, a feat that according to Read, made up in some way for the dismasting on the first leg from Alicante to Cape Town.
Had they not had encountered disaster at such an early stage of the race, things could have been very different, he said, especially since they fought back strongly to be in the reckoning towards the closing stages.
“There aren’t many teams that would have got into the last leg with a fighting chance of winning the race given the way we started,” he said.
“It says a lot about the team and the leadership. All my friends are tiptoeing around me as if I should be pissed off but I couldn’t be happier.

“We didn’t win but it’s a sporting event and they don’t come with guarantees. It wasn’t meant to be but it wasn’t for lack of effort. If we’d had a couple of breaks go our way rather than the other way, we could have been talking something completely different.
“It affected us for three solid legs. We would have made lots of changes in Cape Town but because of the dismast, we didn’t have time so we couldn’t make those changes until China which was too late in the game. But everybody has their ‘ifs’.
“What we just did is a pretty cool thing and we should be proud of that.”
In keeping with the theme of the 2011-12 race, there was a close fought battle for second place with Camper and Groupama neck and neck until the final yards when the Kiwis lurched over the line first to secure second place overall.
Groupama were third while Telefonica ran in fourth. Ian Walker’s Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing were penalised at the first mark for obstructing Team Sanya and finished fifth with Mike Sanderson’s crew bringing up the rear.
