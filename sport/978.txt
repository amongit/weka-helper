It will be the UFC's 'Battle of the Bulge' with six top-15 ranked heavyweights in action on the main card in Phoenix on Saturday night, with two of the elite in action as former UFC champion Junior Dos Santos takes on rising contender Stipe Miocic with title implications from the result of the five-round bout.
Dos Santos, ranked No 2, is an outstanding boxer with incredible power, capable of ending a fight with just one punch. The Brazilian joined the UFC in October 2008, and he made a huge statement in his Octagon debut, stunning top contender Fabricio Werdum.
‘Cigano’ then racked up six more wins against some of the best in the division to earn himself a shot at champion Cain Velasquez. Many expected it to be a five-round slugfest but the end came in just 64 seconds.
It was a moment Dos Santos had dreamed of when growing up in poverty in Brazil, and he appeared determined to hold on to the gold.
A rematch with Velasquez proved to be a step too far, but the Brazilian got back on track in spectacular fashion against Mark Hunt.

Despite losing the trilogy fight with his arch rival, Dos Santos will be looking to show that he’s still one of the best heavyweights in the world. But he faces another tough test against an up-and-coming fighter with his own title aspirations.
The son of Croatian immigrants to the US, Miocic is a fantastic all-round athlete, who was an NCAA division-one wrestler. He was also a golden gloves boxing champion and has finished nine of his 12 career wins by knockout.
Miocic entered the UFC in 2011 and made an immediate impact, taking his perfect record to 9-0 with a trio of impressive displays.
The Ohio native’s rise was halted by an in form Stefan Struve, but he bounced right back with the biggest win of his career, against Roy ‘Big Country’ Nelson.
Another dominant victory over Gabriel Gonzaga earned him a date with Dos Santos, but when ‘Cigano’ picked up an injury, Miocic made short work of Fabio Maldonado.
The 32-year-old will finally get his hands on Dos Santos this weekend, as he looks to make the next step up to prove he can become a genuine title contender.

There’s also plenty at stake in the co-main event as Lightweight contender Rafael Dos Anjos welcomes fan favourite Nate Diaz back to the Octagon. Dos Anjos is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu who’s adept at finishing fights on the ground.
But the 30-year-old has also developed his striking skills, making him equally dangerous on the feet. Dos Anjos has been working his way up the Lightweight ladder since 2008 but over the past two-and-a-half years he’s surged to the top.
The Brazilian has now won seven of his last eight fights including a stunning upset of former champion Benson Henderson.
Another win on Saturday could put Dos Anjos next in line for a shot at the belt, but that will be no easy task against one of the UFC’s most exciting fighters.
Diaz is renowned for keeping a relentless pace, putting his incredible boxing to good use. He also possesses outstanding submission skills, thanks to his black-belt in Gracie ju-jitsu.
Since winning season 5 of The Ultimate Fighter, the man from Stockton has racked up 12 UFC wins, 10 of them crowd pleasing finishes.
An impressive run to a title shot in 2012 ended in disappointment, but the Californian was back to his best in his last trip to the octagon, dominating his old foe Gray Maynard.
With his contract dispute set aside for now, Diaz can finally return to what he does best, as he looks to get back in contention at 155.

Also on the card in Phoenix are two Dutch heavyweights battling for bragging rights, as former Strikeforce champion Alistair Overeem takes on the returning Stefan Struve.
The pair have had their moments in the Octagon. But with both men looking to get back on track, national solidarity will fall by the wayside.
Heavyweight Matt Mitrione also returns against Gabriel Gonzaga. Expect the ranking positions between 11 and 15 to do the shuffle, and when it comes to the main card, with half a dozen heavyweights slugging it out, it will be a case of 'don't blink'.
