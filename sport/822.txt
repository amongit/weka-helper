Six Nations 2015: Wales coach Warren Gatland ensures Ireland's Johnny Sexton is beaten at his own game

On paper Ireland controlled that Test match. Just look at the statistics: 64 per cent possession, 66 per cent territory. 185 ball carries compared with 94 for Wales, 461 metres made compared with 195.
Test matches, though, are not won on paper. Wales were magnificent at the Millennium Stadium and fully deserved the victory; they came out of the blocks quickly, established an early lead and then defended with their lives.
Here is how they did it:
Game management
Wales were brilliant in the first 15 minutes of the match. We know what a good kicking game Ireland have got but Wales beat them at their own game in a fascinating, if not aesthetically pleasing, first 15 minutes. Wales kicked well, chased well, won early territory and managed to establish an early 12-point lead before Ireland knew what had hit them. Suddenly Joe Schmidt’s team were in a completely different match to the ones they have got used to recently.
Wales forced Ireland to play slightly differently to what they are used to. They didn’t allow their visitors to build any momentum, to get into that rhythm which we have all seen them in over the last year or so. They put them under immense pressure at the breakdown, forcing uncharacteristic errors. Ireland had to adjust the way they played but found they were unable to.


Referee
Wayne Barnes sent out an early message that he wasn’t going to tolerate any slowing down of the ball at the breakdown. And I think that largely contributed to what was an incredible spectacle in the second half.
Both teams knew that they would have to remain on their feet if they wanted to compete and it made for some relentless passages of play.

I thought Barnes made the right calls on the yellow cards. Sam Warburton was off his feet. But again, Wales were particularly good when Warburton was in the sin bin. They handled those 10 minutes very intelligently, deploying a couple of good driving mauls. Wales were probably as clever as I’ve ever seen them in terms of managing the game. Ireland got no real advantage out of having the extra man on either occasion.
Defence
You don’t need fireworks and confetti and loud music to get the atmosphere going at the Millennium Stadium, you just need to show huge commitment with or without the ball. That period from about 50min-60min was the game-changer. Wales didn’t miss a tackle. To go through 32 or 33 phases, much of them in your own 22m, without conceding a penalty, was an incredible effort. Wales forced Ireland to work so hard.

The Irish half-backs were always under pressure. They were unable to open up in an attacking sense. Wales’ next tacklers were always in position and Ireland found they couldn’t get the ball clear of the breakdown.
On the occasions when Ireland did have opportunities to score, they made errors. I can think of one instance when Sean Cronin took it into contact against the grain and Ireland ended up conceding a penalty. They have not done that all this series. Schmidt’s side have been so precise. All in all, it was a monumental Welsh performance in defence. I mean, Luke Charteris made 37 tackles on his own. A second row making 37 tackles? Brilliant.
Set-piece
The two teams were probably just about even-stevens at the set-piece.

Ireland had a slight edge at scrum time – particularly after Samson Lee was stretchered off and Gethin Jenkins picked up a hamstring strain – but Wales managed to hang in there. They did not allow it to become an issue for them. Schmidt obviously wasn’t happy with the refereeing of scrums. And the one for Wales in the final passage of play was a big call. But in the line-out Wales were excellent at pressuring Irish ball, forcing a couple of turnovers.
Attack
Ireland had so much possession but Wales took away their kicking advantage.
And as far as backline play was concerned, Jonathan Sexton was uncharacteristically loose. He made a couple of errors and was not looking at one stage when the ball came his way. But again, give credit to Wales.

The cumulative pressure they put on Ireland forced those errors. Dan Biggar is a very unpretentious young man but he is very effective. And Wales had so much experience outside him. Jamie Roberts was magnificent in defence, with one memorable cover tackle saving a try. Jonathan Davies was likewise extremely solid. Halfpenny was simply brilliant. His kick and chase in first 15 minutes gave Wales the platform to win the game. It changed the whole momentum of the match. Wales also made good substitutions with Scott Williams, the try scorer, obviously coming on and having a positive impact.
Even then Schmidt’s team, desperate for that Grand Slam, came back well. It was an excellent Test match between two very good teams, make no mistake about that. I particularly enjoyed seeing the camaraderie between the Lions at the end.
Ireland will be hugely disappointed to see their Grand Slam dream die but I don’t think that it is necessarily a problem for them long-term. They have to look at variety when a team matches them in the kicking department and at the breakdown. As for Wales that was as animated as I have seen their management, with Warren Gatland out of his seat and Shaun Edwards a bundle of nervous energy.
