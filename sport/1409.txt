Right-to-buy move for Scottish football backed by MSPs
MSPs have backed plans to allow fans the right to buy their football clubs.
Members of the local government committee supported amendments to the Community Empowerment Bill to extend the right-to-buy to football fans.
Green MSP Alison Johnstone, who moved the amendments, told the committee that agreeing to the changes would turn the legislation into a landmark bill.
If passed by the full parliament, supporters' trusts would get "first refusal" when a club comes up for sale.
A supporters' trust with a registered interest in a football club would also have the right to buy shares in that club, including a controlling interest, at any point.
It is understood the Scottish FA and the Scottish Professional Football League are against the plans.
The bill was initially designed to allow community groups the right to purchase local land but could now be extended to football clubs.
Ms Johnstone said: "This is an extraordinary day for the future of Scottish football.
"We know how badly the game has been struggling, from Gretna to Hearts and Rangers, and we know fan ownership works.
"It's great that parliament has today united around the principle of a responsible fans' right to buy their clubs."
The Scottish Green MSP said that, if passed by the full Scottish Parliament, fans would have "nothing to fear from irresponsible owners like those who have undermined so many clubs".
She added: "We know there are plenty of good private owners of clubs, and this will not require fans to buy them out, but when they move on, fans will be in the right place to take over if they wish."
Ms Johnstone's amendments bring the principles of rural land reform laws, which help communities buy land, to supporters of football clubs.
The new legislation would mean that supporters' trusts would legally register an interest in a football club.
This would mean the owner of the club would be prohibited from "taking any action with a view to the transfer of ownership of that football club" until it had complied with the act.
The supporters' trust would then be given an opportunity to buy the club at a price assessed by an appointed valuer.
Local Government Minister Marco Biagi said the Scottish government wanted to give fans the right to buy their clubs using regulations which would be put in place after the bill was passed.
"Affirmative procedure for the development of the details, with the aim put in the bill, would allow consultation with the wider football community; it would allow consultation, as appropriate, with the parliament; and it would ensure that we don't just endorse the principle but we ensure that any legislation we introduce we get right," he said.
Scottish Labour's Ken Macintosh, who supported Ms Johnstone's amendments, said: "I believe it would be difficult for anyone in Scotland to stand up and defend the current state of Scottish football in terms of its accountability, its sustainability or simply its success.
"Football fans and local communities have not only lost out, they have been made to feel powerless, sometimes even taken advantage of or had their goodwill exploited."
"Fan ownership is not the only option but it should be one of the options open to all those who want to see Scottish football thrive."

Highland Council Trading Standards have issued a warning to residents over scam parcel delivery postcards.
The postcards claim that there is a parcel containing jewellery or other valuables worth up to £50 waiting for the homeowner.
A card then gives an 0800 telephone number for the homeowner to call to arrange for a delivery, and asks for a delivery free of £10 for the supposedly pre-paid items. Telephone numbers beginning 020 are also reportedly to have given on previous version of the card.
Anyone who receives one of these postcards should report the matter to the Police via Action Fraud, and should not call the number provided, or give out their card details.

This year's Edinburgh International Festival is targeting a younger audience.
This aim can clearly be seen from the shows on offer: productions like The Magic Flute combine opera and animation, and the superb National theatre of Scotland show Dragon uses puppetry and other wizardry to tell a universal tale.
And it's not just new younger audiences. Many of the fresh faces are performers.
But is there enough to convince regulars, young or old? It certainly seems so.

Background and analysis of today's Budget announcement, all the latest on the museum attack in the Tunisian capital, and a DNA study of Britain has revealed new findings on Celts and Anglo-Saxons.
Listen live here.
A dry end to the day and start to the evening. Fairly cloudy in places, with the last of any brighter skies holding on across the west and north-west.
Tonight, it's dry with clear spells in the south. Some rain in the north-west overnight, but most places stay dry.
Lows around 2 to 4 celsius, with light winds.
A report by hygiene inspectors has highlighted continuing problems with hospital cleanliness.
It follows a report by the Royal College of Nursing, which found that inspections of elderly care wards had not resulted in improvements.
Although the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate said standards of cleanliness were generally improving, it also noted that patient equipment and trolleys were often contaminated, that there was a poor standard of cleaning in emergency departments and staff were not always clear of their cleaning responsibilities.
The Royal College of Nursing said that aspects of cleaning are more likely to fall through the gaps as the NHS workforce is increasingly stretched.
Scotland's charity air ambulance is to be replaced with a more modern helicopter after the Chancellor announced it would receive more than £3m from Libor funds.
The money comes from fines imposed on banks that tried to manipulate the financial markets.

Celtic and Scotland captain Scott Brown has admitted he made a mistake after being photographed apparently drunk and eating junk food on a night out.
"I don't think I'm the first player to make a mistake and probably won't be the last but I've spoken to the manager, it's been dealt with and now all I'm doing is moving on," Brown said in the Celtic View.
"I'm sure the club, the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for Celtic.
"It was a real honour as captain to lift the League Cup on Sunday and we now want to push on and try and bring our fans even more success this season. That's all we're thinking about."
Two men have gone on trial accused of murdering a suspected drugs trafficker whose body was found in a field in Renfrewshire 11 years ago.
Douglas Fleming, 50, and John McDonald, 57, are accused of killing 34-year-old Martin Toner whose body was found by a farmer near Langbank in July 2004.
They are alleged to have stabbed Mr Toner and cut his throat on 29 June.
Both men deny the charges against them. Mr Toner was due in court on drug trafficking charges when he was killed.
Manager Tommy Wright fears for the future of player development at St Johnstone, with the club's newly built grass training facility under threat.
Perth and Kinross Council has voted eight to five in favour of a compulsory purchase order on the land next to McDiarmid Park for a new link road.
"A lot of money, time and effort has gone into getting the facilities up and running in Perth," said Wright.
"It would be a huge blow to the club to lose them."
Reacting to George Osborne's final Budget before the general election, SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie said it "failed to address the real needs of the people of Scotland" by continuing with an "utterly failed austerity agenda".
"Between 2009/10 and 2014/15, Scotland's budget has fallen by around 11% in real terms, within this capital expenditure has fallen by around 25%," Mr Hosie said.
"The UK government has already cut Scotland's budget by a staggering £3.5 billion in real terms since 2009/10. Scotland's share of today's further UK public spending cuts, over the five years to 2019-20 will amount to billions more.
"The Chancellor has failed. He has missed all his targets on the deficit and debt and he is promising, according to the independent IFS think tank, 'colossal cuts' in the years to come. This Chancellor and this Budget have failed Scotland."
Sir Ian Wood predicts there will still be 5,000 to 10,000 job losses in the offshore industry, despite today's tax cuts.

The number of gannets off the north-west coast of Scotland has increased rapidly over the last 10 years, a study suggests.
Aerial images were used to count the number of apparently occupied sites (AOS) - spots on rocks which are frequented by gannets.
A total of 60,290 AOS were counted on St Kilda.
A further 11,230 were seen on Sula Sgeir, where young birds are legally harvested each year.
Iain: Having listened to the Budget, the one thing that stood out was not what was said but the childish, boorish behaviour of the people who are representing us in parliament. Their behaviour is appalling and would not be allowed in schools or any other place of work. There needs to be a vast improvement in their behaviour. How can they tell us how to behave and respect others when they cannot?

George Osborne says his oil industry measures amount to £1.3bn of support for the industry.
He says the OBR's assessment is that it will boost expected North Sea oil production by 15% by the end of the decade.
Here you can read more detail on what this announcement means.
A ban on discarding unwanted fish into the sea will be difficult to comply with, researchers claim.
Boats having to land unwanted fish caught in their nets started being phased in at the start of the year, under European laws.
Throwing dead fish back into the sea had increased due to strict EU quotas on which fish could be landed in a bid to conserve stocks.
The University of Strathclyde said it would pose the industry problems.

It said the action had been taken after a complaint was received and passed to Police Scotland.
A spokesman for the force said the matter was being investigated.
George Osborne says £13bn of the mortgage assets still held from the bailouts of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley are to be sold off. There's a further £9bn of Lloyds shares being sold, too.
That significantly boosts the room for manoeuvre the chancellor has in making spending plans - but he says that he prefers to spend this money by paying down the national debt.

The Public Services ombudsman has called on Scottish Water to compensate house owners near a pumping station in North Ayrshire who've complained about noise and vibration for the past nine years.
It's the first time the ombudsman, Jim Martin, has made a recommendation like this. He says Scottish Water hasn't done enough to address the concerns of residents, many of whom are elderly.
This will be a "truly national recovery", and savers and pensioners will benefit, the chancellor says. "We have a plan that is working and this Budget works for you."
Chancellor George Osborne is delivering his 2015 Budget in the House of Commons.

Four SNP councillors who were suspended from the party after burning a copy of the Smith Commission report have been re-elected to top posts within their local group.
A video of the elected Renfrewshire Council members burning the document was posted online in December, but later removed.
They were reinstated by the party last month after a two month suspension.
All four have now been re-elected to executive posts by the SNP group.
Liz Cameron, chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, says the rise in unemployment is "disappointing" and a "reminder of the challenges that continue to affect the Scottish economy".
"These figures cover a period when the effects of the low oil prices were beginning to bite in our oil and gas sector," she adds.
"That said, we should remember that employment has also increased by 6,000 over the same period and the reason for these apparently contradictory changes has been that Scotland's pool of available workers has grown overall."
