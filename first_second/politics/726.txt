Let me not to the marriage of true minds/admit impediments â€“ that's what Shakespeare said in a sonnet. That's what I say to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, the new pair of Republican sheriffs on the Hill. They've got the power, as the first team of majority House and Senate Republican leaders since President Barack Obama took office.
They are also, functionally, like two Southern sheriffs walking the halls on the Hill. The next two years do not bode well for working together on any legislation that Obama might hope to pass and sign in his fourth quarter. These two bad sports are still grousing about Obamacare, which is so 2010. So far in 2015, the first major bill McConnell has brought to the floor for debate is one Obama indicated he'd veto: building the Keystone XL pipeline.
