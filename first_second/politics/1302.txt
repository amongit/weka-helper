1. If At First You Don’t Succeed, Bash Obamacare: After bailing on a bill that would have banned abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy — an embarrassing face-plant with thousands of pro-life activists in town for the annual Roe v. Wade festivities — the Republican-led House instead used abortion to slap around Obamacare, the law they love to hate. The bill bans the use of taxpayer funds (in this case, Affordable Care Act tax subsidies), after a federal report found 18 states' health care exchanges included abortion coverage.
2. Cop Out: A coalition of Republican women forced House Speaker John Boehner’s team to pull the bill from the House floor, a development that, if you squinted, looked like GOP women standing up for women’s rights. On closer inspection, however, their objection wasn’t with the idea behind the bill itself — they agree fetuses feel pain after 20 weeks of gestation and want the ban. Turns out that the rebels, led by Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana thought a so-called “rape exemption” provision was too narrow: it would allow women to undergo pregnancy termination if they get a police report first. And, since most rape victims typically don’t report the attacks, the exemption was too narrow and could hurt the GOP’s brand image among the youngs. As if it was all that positive with them in the first place.
