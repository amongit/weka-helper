So, America has finally decided, and frankly I'm exhausted. You see, like an idiot, I stayed up all night channel-hopping between BBC, ITV, Sky and CNN, in the desperate hunt for thrilling revelations about Obama v Romney. Mostly, I found myself blearily squinting at the revolving carousel of presenters, pundits and pollsters, desperately trying to tell them apart. A few stood out; CNN's white-bearded anchor is the rather brilliantly-named Wolf Blitzer - the closest a human can get to personifying a Steven Seagal movie - and he excitedly wittered on about how CNN had turned the Empire State Building into a giant election-o-meter thingie, leaving me bitterly disappointed when King Kong failed to appear at the top, wearing an 'I Love Mitt' t-shirt and demanding an Ohio recount.
Having recently spent a shedload of cash on lawyers, the BBC lacked the same budget, but their long-suffering CGI wrangler, Jeremy Vine, nevertheless found himself being menaced by a huge floating pie chart, while standing in what appeared to be the gladiatorial backdrop to Mortal Kombat. One gets the feeling Vine spends his days in the Tron mainframe, desperately trying to do his radio show while batting off an army of digital gladiators. Meanwhile, ITV's Romilly Weeks revealed herself to possess astoundingly vertiginous cheekbones, the kind you might like to ski down if you were a middle class beetle, and Sky News elected to broadcast from a clearly chilly Chicago, where the ghost of every spoken syllable lingered coolly in the air around mouths and noses.
