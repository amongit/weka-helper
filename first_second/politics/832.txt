Barack Obama has become a pathbreaker in an unexpected way. He realizes that Americans today expect their president not only to be inspirational, educational, managerial and empathetic but also to be a part of popular culture. And he continues to find new ways to play the role of celebrity in chief.
In some respects he is following the lead of previous presidents who achieved superstar status, notably Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. These earlier commanders in chief had charisma, as all true celebrities do – an aura that made people want to know what they were like and what their ideas were. Each mastered the media of their day and deftly used their notoriety not just to maintain their fame but also to sell their agendas. These skills have become even more necessary in today’s celebritydriven culture, and future presidents will have to adopt some of President Obama’s media strategies to succeed.
