The hospitals of Ciudad Ju√°rez bear the brunt of the deadly shootouts that rival criminal organizations unleash against one another throughout the city. "The authorities are failing us," an emergency room doctor at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social told me. "When more soldiers arrived in March, the city did calm down for a month or two, but now the violence is as bad as ever. It's as if the gangs had decided to wait and see what the army would do and then realized that they could carry on their business with total impunity."
As we spoke, two soldiers and a municipal guard escorted a man with gunshot wounds across the aisle and into a separate room. "We need security because otherwise the gangsters would finish off their victims," the doctor said.
