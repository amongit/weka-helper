In "Rules for Radicals," community agitator Saul Alinsky famously observed that those who are not part of the solution are part of the problem.
To him this justified the inconveniences people not directly involved in the protests he advocated would experience should these result, for example, in restrooms being shut down at crowded airports. Because the great mass of people failed to join these rallies against injustice, they were, by keeping quiet, in silent collusion with the oppressive power structure he sought to overthrow.
