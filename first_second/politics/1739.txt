Recently President Obama drew the ire of many by pointing to the terrible deeds done in the name of Christ. He was applauded by others. To me, it all seemed rather lame.
Isn't it obvious that we, humanity, have traditionally and habitually cloaked egotistic behavior behind the mantle of religion or spirituality? So should it be a cause for celebration that a president pointed to the Spanish Inquisition and Jim Crow as evidence? And, on the other hand, isn't it astonishing that the president would be attacked for saying the plain truth, especially when it refers to events mostly in the distant past?
