The beleaguered but battling-back American Legislative Exchange Council has won a major victory in the state of Minnesota that may force its opponents to rewrite the narrative they have been using to try to destroy it.
Up to know, the liberal groups that oppose ALEC’s work – which is to develop sensible, pro-free market policies at the state level by providing a forum for legislators and job creators to meet and exchange ideas – have been attacking it with one hand, calling it a vehicle for special interests and a secretive lobby group, while trying to replicate it with the other. Their latest effort involves the combination of at least three different groups doing similar things into one organization whose objective is to move policy at the state level to the left, while ALEC has been pushing back against allegations its activities in support of market-based public policy solutions has somehow been unethical.
