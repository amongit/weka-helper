Washington (CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is on an ambitious mission this spring to scoop up major GOP donors ahead of a likely presidential run and send the early message that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush doesn't have a monopoly on the country's deep-pocketed Republicans -- and his backers say his plan is working.
So far the expedition has been successful enough that Republicans not involved with his political effort have noticed, and several GOP operatives in Bush's orbit conceded to CNN it's clear a substantial chunk of GOP financiers have taken a liking to him. Walker's PAC, Our American Revival, provided CNN with a list of names of reliable Republican donors who have already committed to bundle funds for him or contribute significantly to a Super PAC that would be developed to support him should he run. And Republican fundraisers have told CNN donors are lining up to meet with him as he's rocketing up in the polls.
