Good Tuesday morning, the 13th day of 2015 and the day after one person died and nearly 90 were hospitalized in a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority subway accident, the worst loss of life since a derailment in June of 2009 killed nine. That crash triggered a multi-year, $6 billion overhaul, addressing years of federal underfunding; Congress passed a stopgap funding bill last fall but a permanent one is nowhere in sight. It’s the second day of Senate debate over the Keystone XL pipeline, Job One on the new Republican-majority wish list – and probably President Barack Obama’s first post-midterm veto. It’s also the first meeting between the president and the GOP’s congressional leaders since the 2014 midterms; the stated goal is finding common ground, but given mutual suspicions (see above), don’t hold your breath for a breakthrough. Here’s an abbreviated version of the Three-Minute Briefing:
One Down, One to Go: The Supreme Court has decided not to hear a broad-strokes challenge to Obamacare, one brought by a physicians’ group that wants the law repealed. But don’t think the court has suddenly embraced the law formerly known as the Affordable Care Act: The big enchilada’s an upcoming technical challenge coming to the court, which could strip away tax subsidies for millions of health care subscribers.
