MIAMIâ€”I've been traveling on the East Coast during the past few weeks, giving speeches about my books and talking about the problems in Washington. And everywhere I've gone, from Boston to New York, Baltimore, Charleston and Miami, conservatives, liberals and independents have asked the same question: What's wrong with our "leaders" in the nation's capital?
The question has taken on more of an edge than it did on similar trips in the past. People are paying close attention as an extraordinary number of crises, failures and clashes erupt day after day, while President Barack Obama and legislators in Congress are unable to get their act together and fail to solve the nation's problems.
