Not everyone realizes it yet, but the apparent success of the "cromnibus" legislative vehicle to fund most of the federal government through September 30, 2015 is a major victory for the conservatives who now make up the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party in Congress.
The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 – the formal designation for the combined continuing resolution and omnibus funding bill – maintains the Ryan-Murray spending caps of $521 billion for defense and $492 billion for non-defense spending. It also leaves the Department of Homeland Security as the only agency not funded through the end of the fiscal year. So unless President Barack Obama is willing to go to the mattresses over his plan to give 5 million illegal aliens temporary legal status, and many people are betting he isn’t, the legislation makes a government shutdown highly unlikely.
