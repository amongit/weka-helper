New Delhi: Former Press Council of India chairman Markandey Katju has sparked another row by apparently making a sexist comment involving BJP's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi and recently-joined leader Shazia Ilmi.
In two successive tweets Katju said, "I regard Shazia Ilmi much more beautiful than Kiran Bedi. If Shazia had been made their C.M. candidate BJP wud have definitely won the Delhi elections....People vote for beautiful faces, as in Croatia. Even a person like me who does not vote wud have voted for Shazia."
