WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Barack Obama and top Democrats are ramping up their 2014 fundraising push, hoping to give a boost to fellow Democrats competing in November's midterm elections.
Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama will all pitch in over the coming weeks, as candidates and party committees seek to stockpile as much cash as possible before major spending on campaign ads begins. For Obama, whose lackluster poll numbers make him a liability for many Democratic candidates, raising money is one of the most effective ways he can help his party in 2014.
