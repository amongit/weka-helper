The Parole Board of Canada says it can no longer dedicate its resources to clearing a backlog of old pardon applications, leaving thousands of former offenders in legal limbo.
The board maintains that almost 6,000 remaining pardon applications received before the rules were changed in 2012 will be processed as time and money permit.
