What a difference a day makes, they say. "They" are so right, Jake. And they say an individual can make a difference – and "they" are right again. I can think of three men who have made a big difference and another – well, not so much.
What a difference a mayor can make. Just look at the New York cityscape's change since one Mayor Michael Bloomberg showed up to take charge. Housing has boomed – or bloomed – and so has development, building and rezoning in general. An activist mayor isn't going to get everything right – and Bloomberg will leave office with a shadow of aggressive police searches over his head. But he was in there pitching every day and New Yorkers could feel and see his presence in everyday life. Bike-sharing in Manhattan? You bet. In a dozen years of rethinking the questions and answers, Bloomberg has redrawn the physical and mental boundaries on the map of New York. He fought to have less asphalt and fewer cars on that map, according to The New York Times, for a greener city. So he had a little chutzpah – so what? People actually like to see public officials who are bold and restless, who chafe about getting things done. Bloomberg is a dreamer and a doer – that's a tough combination to crack.
