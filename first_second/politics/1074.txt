One of the big questions hanging over tonight's speech relates to Obamacare â€“ how does the president handle it? One way or the other, Obamacare is going to be a major issue in the election, whether because it spurs voters to rise up against the Democrats or because Republicans misread voter dissatisfaction with the law and overreach.
So what does Obama do? I posed that question at a Bipartisan Policy Center panel on the speech this morning and got a surprising unanimity of answers, though not all for the same reason. The bottom line: Obama needs to own Obamacare.
