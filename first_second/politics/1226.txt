It’s Tuesday, the 69th day of 2015 and the second year since congressional Republicans blocked a bill that would raise the federal debt ceiling, triggering a government shutdown that lasted about two weeks. The central objection then was the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP wanted repealed in exchange for approving an increase in the debt limit. The government’s on the brink of another crisis at the end of this week. And while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says don’t expect a replay of 2013, the wild cards – House conservatives – haven’t yet weighed in on the issue (more on that in a minute), and it’s likely they’re still mad about Speaker John Boehner’s end-run around their blockade tying Department of Homeland Security funding to a repeal of President Barack Obama’s executive action shielding millions of immigrants from deportation.

Letter Bomb: The unprecedented letter 47 Republicans signed and sent to Tehran, warning about nuclear negotiations with the U.S., has blown up like an exploding cigar. Obama called it “ironic” that the Republicans are lining up with Iranian hard-liners who don’t like the talks, Vice President Joe Biden went ballistic in a statement, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid slammed the GOP on the Senate floor and Sen. Dick Durbin called them out for their Obama hateration. Even the handful of Republicans who didn’t sign the letter are keeping the Gang of 47 at arm’s length, suggesting it was a dumb idea that could hurt the party in the long run.
