Smarting from defeat in 2012, Republican politicians were warned by one of their own not to be the "stupid party." Their response to the caution was not to do anything but obstruct the initiatives of President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate. Luckily for the GOP, it worked. The blame for federal government inaction fell mostly on President Obama and helped Republicans win majority control of Congress in 2014.
Now, however, the admonition not to be stupid takes on added urgency since Republicans cannot employ default to satisfy the electorate. The GOP's recent congressional victory magnifies the responsibility to govern, and so far, the party has failed spectacularly in that regard.
