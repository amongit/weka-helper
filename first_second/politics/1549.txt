CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Republican Party's 2012 platform is one of the most conservative in modern history, with policy positions that even GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney won't endorse. It endorses a constitutional ban on abortion access, comes out squarely against same-sex marriage rights and calls on the District of Columbia to loosen its gun laws.
The Republican platform has not always been so extreme. It has consistently touted smaller government, lower taxes and the benefits of private enterprise. But the GOP's past policy positions on issues like labor, women's rights and environmental protection sound more like planks that today's Democrats would have in their official platform, showing how the Republican Party has shifted more and more to the right since World War II.
