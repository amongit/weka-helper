Thanks to the epic success of the People's Climate March, alarm bells demanding climate action have never rung louder. So, now that you've succeeded in elevating the mother of all issues to the top of the global agenda, where should you and your fellow 399,999 marchers direct your tide-turning energies?
1. Dig in to Food and Climate If you're up to speed on the climate impacts of the energy and transportation sectors, why not investigate the often hidden connections between food and climate? Did you know the global food system can exacerbate our woes (for instance, agriculture is responsible for 75 percent of global deforestation) or be key to solving them? (Organic farms use 30-50 percent less fossil fuel energy than industrial farms). This accessible report on the topic can get you started. If your book club is looking for a good read, there are many great books that elucidate the connection between food and climate including Anna Lappe's classic Diet for a Hot Planet, and Dan Barber's thoughtful meditation, The Third Plate. If you're looking for something truly meaty, tackle, This Changes Everything, hot off the press by the inimitable Naomi Klein.
