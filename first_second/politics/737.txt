Greetings from weary Washington. We feel like it's 1994 all over again.
That was when Congress changed colors and stripes overnight to red in both chambers. Newt Gingrich, suddenly speaker of the House, was the principal engineer of the change. On the Senate side, James Inhofe was one of the freshman Republican senators blown in by the winds on the plains of Oklahoma. Now, with a Republican majority back in power, the hard-charging Inhofe will become chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Inhofe represents the drastic policy change a-coming, for he's actively hostile to the scientific consensus on climate change.
