For New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo it’s been an amazingly, incredibly, incalculably, stunningly bad week.
Ever since the New York Times published an in-depth examination of the role the governor and some of his top aides allegedly played in first obstructing and then abolishing the Moreland Commission – a state government corruption probe that was getting uncomfortably close to some of Cuomo’s friends and allies – his political fortunes have faltered. What was once an almost certain re-election effort is now truly in doubt, despite the fact that Cuomo continues to lead his Republican opponent, Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, by double digits.
