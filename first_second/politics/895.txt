Liberals are having serious trouble making a persuasive case that they can solve the nation's economic problems, according to Democratic strategists Stan Greenberg and James Carville.
"The state of the American economy looms over the public, creating long-term pessimism about the state of the country, making the economy, wages and jobs the biggest factor in people's vote in the last national election and the next," Greenberg and Carville argue in a new analysis for Democracy Corps, a Democrat-oriented research organization. "People are aware of improvements in the macro economy and in the labor market, but they are even more aware that new jobs pay less and people have not seen a raise in a very long time." The two influential strategists add: "Republicans are more trusted on the economy by a lot, and conservatives are at parity with liberals on the intellectual arguments. Without progressives really attacking the core economic problems, austerity is still preferred to investments and full-employment spending."
