Conventional wisdom tells us natural gas is helping us combat global warming. Like most bits of conventional wisdom, it's not that simple.
First the aforementioned wisdom: Natural gas is unquestionably helping the United States reduce its climate footprint. Our nation's greenhouse-gas emissions have dropped to levels not seen since the 1990s, thanks in part to this cleaner-burning fuel. Natural gas produces half the carbon emissions of coal and about a third fewer than oil. This is why everyone in the Obama administration, including the president himself, can't talk enough about the climate benefits of natural gas.
