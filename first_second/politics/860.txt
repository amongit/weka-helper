President Barack Obama will try to capture the country's imagination and garner its support for a bold populist agenda in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening. White House aides say he will kick off an aggressive campaign against the rich and unveil or refresh a series of unilateral actions to prove that he is not an irrelevant lame duck.
What is likely to make the biggest splash--and start another political war over taxes and income inequality--is Obama's plan to increase taxes and fees on the richest Americans and on the nation's largest financial institutions in order to finance tax cuts for the middle class and other programs.
