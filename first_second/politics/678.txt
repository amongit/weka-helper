In 2014, Americans weren't quite sure where to direct their political anxiety. Last year was the first since 2001 when less than 20 percent of Americans agreed on what was the country's top issue, according to Gallup. Government topped the list due to frustrations with President Barack Obama, Republicans in Congress and political gridlock. But the economy followed close behind, with Americans worried the recovery from the Great Recession is happening too slowly. Unemployment, health care and immigration followed.
In some ways, the U.S. was fortunate in 2014 that there wasn't an issue big or hazardous enough to motivate total agreement among Americans. Since 2008, the economy led the list, topping out at 40 percent in 2009. Before that, the war in Iraq and terrorism were the central issues. 2014 found war and terrorism at the bottom of the list, with both only garnering 2 percent of votes each.
