Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's announcement that he is considering a run for president in 2016 scrambles the potential Republican field and crystallizes the internal party rift that probably will make choosing a GOP nominee both protracted and polarizing.
Bush, 61, certainly has an excellent political pedigree. He is the son of one former president, George H.W. Bush, and brother of another, George W. Bush, and he was the popular two-term governor of a big state. But the fact that there is no sudden rush within the GOP to Bush's side shows how fractured the party is, divided among social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party conservatives, national security hawks, libertarians, establishment Republicans, and those who want a Washington outsider in the White House.
