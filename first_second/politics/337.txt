Marijuana has long been classified in the federal government as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has no use—medical or otherwise—in society. Now, a group of bipartisan senators is trying to change the classification to Schedule II, which would acknowledge that the drug has an accepted medical use, and free states to enact their medical-marijuana laws without the fear of federal legal repercussions.
Republican Sen. Rand Paul, joining with Democrats Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, introduced the CARERS Act (Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States) Tuesday. The law seeks to legalize medical marijuana in states that have already passed medical-marijuana legislation. Essentially, it would be a codification of the status quo—the Obama administration does not pursue federal marijuana charges in states that have passed pro-marijuana legislation.
