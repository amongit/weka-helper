President Barack Obama's current foreign trip highlights the importance of personal diplomacy in the conduct of international affairs, an approach to governing that Obama hasn't used as much as some of his predecessors.
One reason why Obama has managed to achieve a variety of agreements with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is because the two leaders have developed a personal friendship, White House aides say. This became clear when they announced a pact aimed at encouraging American companies to eventually build nuclear power plants in India. Even though important details remain to be worked out, Obama hailed the understanding as an example of international cooperation. "We achieved a breakthrough understanding on two issues that were holding up our ability to advance our civil nuclear cooperation, and we're committed to moving towards full implementation," Obama said during his visit to New Delhi. "And this is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship."
