The president is doing his job better. In 2014, all five months of it, he has shown more boldness and brio, and less political innocence, at home. Abroad, his foreign policy might be defined as "less is more." We've had too much of more for most of the 21st century.
Political experience has given him gray hair and taught him the limits – and the powers – of his office. Since legislation is log-jammed, he is governing less by laws and more by unilateral actions. The American people are more interested in actions and results than his command of the English language.
