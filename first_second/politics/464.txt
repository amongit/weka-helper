If you work for a big company that offers you health insurance, chances are that your employer has asked you to take part in some kind of "workplace wellness" program. It might mean nothing more than answering a few questions about your diet and exercise habits. Or it could mean providing more detailed information about your medical status and lifestyle -- and, in some cases, agreeing to individualized targets for weight loss, blood pressure and other vital health indicators.
In principle, the choice to participate in the program is yours. But if you say no, your employer might charge you higher health insurance premiums, to the tune of thousands of extra dollars a year.
