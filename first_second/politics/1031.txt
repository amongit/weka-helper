It’s amazing how the idea that “absence makes the heart grow fonder” expresses itself in the weird world of Washington. One of the more entertaining instances is what I call Clinton Nostalgia Syndrome, where Republicans – especially those who were in Congress in the mid and late 1990s – yearn for the halcyon days of bipartisan compromise that, in their memory, carried the day during the Clinton presidency. There was a brief outbreak of Clinton Nostalgia Syndrome this morning at the “National Strategic Agenda” conference put together by No Labels. Appearing with a dozen of his colleagues from both parties, Arizona GOP Rep. Matt Salmon – asked what the problem in Washington was – bemoaned the absence of the Great Triangulator.
Of course, in the breach Salmon raised that figurative right arm to vote in favor of all four articles of impeachment. So while Salmon yearns for Clinton now, during his presidency the congressman affirmatively tried to remove the man from office.
