Jeb Bush announced on his Facebook page Tuesday morning that he is considering a run for the White House. He plans to kick off his campaign by forming a political action committee in January.
Bush, who served as governor of Florida between 1999 and 2007, wrote that he had talked to his wife, Columba, and their children about "the future of our nation," and now has "decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States."
