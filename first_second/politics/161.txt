Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, says he wishes someone had provided former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with somewhat of a technological tutorial in the wake of the recent flap over her use of private email as the country’s top diplomat.
“I wish someone had explained to her you could put two email icons on her phone,” Mr. Paul told Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith on Sunday, suggesting there was a “certain arrogance and hypocrisy” to her excuse. “The Clintons kind of think the law’s for you ordinary people.”
