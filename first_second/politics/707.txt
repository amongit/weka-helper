Nine in 10 doctors report prescription drug abuse is a moderate to large problem in their communities, and 85 percent believe that prescription drugs are overused in clinical practice, a new doctor survey finds.
About half of doctors say they are less likely to prescribe prescription painkillers than they were a year ago, though the study did not seek to understand whether this was because they had seen adverse effects in their own patients or whether it was because of increased education within the medical community about prescription drug addiction, says Dr. G. Caleb Alexander, study leader and co-director of the Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "There are many drivers of physiciansâ€™ prescribing patterns, ranging from their own clinical experiences to the effects of media, influential scientific publications, clinical practice guidelines and interactions with drug companies," he says.
