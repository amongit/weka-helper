Man. For a minute there, it looked like Republicans were getting serious about this whole income inequality thing. We had Jeb Bush calling it "the defining issue of our time" (OK, he used the phrase "opportunity gap," but you get the idea), and Ted Cruz and Rand Paul lamenting how much worse it's gotten lately.
Since Hillary Clinton has a real rift with the Democratic base on economic policy, and struggles to speak coherently about it, this new GOP populism sounded like it could make the 2016 election, maybe, like, actually interesting.
