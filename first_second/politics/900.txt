More bad news for President Barack Obama: In the aftermath of Republican victories in the midterm election, a majority of Americans – 53 percent – want GOP legislators in Congress to have more influence over the country's direction than Obama during the next year.
This is a turnaround from early 2012 when 46 percent wanted Obama to have more influence and 42 percent favored Congress, according to the latest Gallup poll.
