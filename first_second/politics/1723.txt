The electoral victory of Syriza in Greece on January 25 marked the first government that was elected with a strong mandate to finally say no to European officials who have been trying to remake Europe since at least 2010. While many thought it was impossible for a small country with just 2 percent of the economic output of the 19-nation eurozone to change the course of Europe's history, it is already happening. On Friday, February 20, European officials backed off from their threats and assaults on the Greek financial system, which had already caused more than $13 billion dollars of deposits to flee the country in January. They agreed, for the first time (and for the first country) since Europe's post-crisis austerity began, that the terms of Greece's financing could be renegotiated. On Monday, March 9, officials are expected to present their proposals to eurozone finance ministers. If these are eventually rejected, Greece is considering calling new elections or a referendum over its deal with lenders.
This is a milestone on the way to renewed civilization for the rest of the eurozone. The country that has been the next-hardest hit, with 23.7 percent unemployment, is Spain. And after years of mass unemployment and "reforms" that have hacked away at public services, pensions, labor and civil rights, a political rebellion has been born in Spain that promises to bring the next democratic alternative government to power.
