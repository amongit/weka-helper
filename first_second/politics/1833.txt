While perusing the headlines each morning, I am reminded the world is a mess: Global warming, outbreaks of war, murder, rape, corruption, disease, and kidnappings. Government officials everywhere become entrenched in scandal after scandal. Social problems seep into every crevice of every culture. No one is immune. No one can escape. And everywhere I go, people bemoan the shitty state of affairs. The world seems to be coming apart at the seams and many have lost hope.
Yet, while heaving another sigh, old fashioned newspaper in hand, a tinge of inspiration surges through me like a lightning rod. Dare I say full-blown optimism even.
