So various members of the Louisiana Republican establishment are calling for Rep. Vance McAllister to resign from Congress because of “extreme hypocrisy” and because he’s become “an embarrassment.” It’s true that McAllister is better known by his unfortunate new nom de guerre, “the Kissing Congressman,” and in many states that might be grounds for complaints of hypocrisy and embarrassment, if not for calls for resignation. But when those complaints come from Louisiana Republicans, you have to wonder if it’s an elaborate and belated April Fool’s joke or some sort of satirical performance art meant to illustrate the vacuity of the political system.
Let me take a step back and say that as general matter I don’t think extramarital affairs have much to do with qualification for office and I certainly don’t think they’re grounds for resignation. Now there are cases – if the politician in question made his Christian conservative values the cornerstone of his campaign, for example, as McAllister did – where the revelation of peccadillos opens him up to public ridicule and even campaign charges of hypocrisy. If a pol is going to run on his pristine virtues, an opponent is entitled to make an issue of their absence. And certainly if a politician has a text message exchange with a stranger about the unfolding scandal – as McAllister did – it opens him up to charges of being too stupid to hold public office.
