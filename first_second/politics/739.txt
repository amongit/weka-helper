The autumn sun is bright as I walk by Ben Bradlee's N Street house in Georgetown. Like the magnificent man, the mansion looms larger than life.
It's a red-brick, barrel-chested residence that had belonged to the rich railroad man, Robert Lincoln, the 16th president's oldest son. I remember that then-Sen. John Kennedy and his enchanting wife Jacqueline once lived on this street and were chums of the Bradlees – Ben and his second wife, Antoinette. Bradlee and his third wife, the one and only Sally Quinn, had the best parties in town here – just a twinkling ago.
