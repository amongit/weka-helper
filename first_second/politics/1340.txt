Usually vice presidents face the difficulties that come with running for president from the same party as the sitting president. George H.W. Bush craved Ronald Reagan's endorsement during the Republican primaries in 1988 and then pushed off from the Gipper and set out on his own course with a vision for a "kinder and gentler nation" at the Republican Convention. Al Gore spent the entire 2000 campaign doing an awkward two-step of embracing what he liked about the Clinton-Gore Administration while distancing himself from Clinton the man. It didn't really work out very well.
Hillary Clinton has the even more difficult task of running for president tied at the ankle with Barack Obama and the ring finger with Bill Clinton. The truth is there isn't much she can do about it. "It is what it is" as they say, so Secretary Senator First Lady Clinton and her team shouldn't worry about it. The hugs she and the former president exchanged with the Obamas on Martha's Vineyard to get past the "Don't Do Stupid Stuff" squall this week should just keep going through 2016. If she runs for President they're all in it together.
