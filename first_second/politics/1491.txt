As you may or may not know, Lynn University hosted the final presidential debate of the 2012 election. I'm often asked by members of our community and the media, "Was it worth it?" Was the presidential debate worth all the hard work and money spent? So I thought I would use my first blog for The Huffington Post College to answer that question.
The first point to make in regards to this question is that we did not do this on a lark. We thought deeply about what we wanted to get out of the event and developed some specific goals. Three of the main ones were to engage our students and the community, increase our name recognition and improve our campus.
