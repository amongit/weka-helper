SEATTLE (AP) - When a Seattle television station sought copies of patrol-car dashboard videos from the city’s police department, it took four years and a trip to the Washington Supreme Court for the records to start being provided.
But as a dozen officers have started wearing body cameras in a pilot project to record interactions with the public, the department has taken a vastly different approach under new Chief Kathleen O’Toole. It’s voluntarily putting blurry, silent versions of the videos on YouTube, giving the curious a chance to see what they entail while also protecting the privacy of those depicted.
