A wealthy Republican fundraiser wants to erect a 500-pound American flag high over downtown Miami as a "sign of gratitude for many of us who werenâ€™t born in this country."
Mike Fernandez, a Cuban-American billionaire who famously feuded with the re-election campaign of Florida Governor Rick Scott (R), is offering to fund the $5-10 million flagpole project, according to WSVN. His location of choice is a sliver of land in the public Museum Park, which sits on prime downtown waterfront.
