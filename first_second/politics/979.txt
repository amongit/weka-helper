For the American left, the philanthropy of billionaires Charles and David Koch approaches an obsession. There is no cause they have touched, no effort they have mounted that is not – according to the clack of liberal journalists and bloggers who populate the Internet – somehow tainted by their association with it.
It’s no longer just their political giving that attracts attention. Liberal activists have taken to the streets to protest Koch support for museums, for the theater and the performing arts, for medical research and for just about any other cause to which the brothers – together or individually – choose to donate a share of their considerable wealth.
