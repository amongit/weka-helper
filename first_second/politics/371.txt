New Delhi: With Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) having registered a stunning victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, the party will now have to hit the ground running to fulfil the promises made in its manifesto. Many of the promises made by the party and its chief minister-designate Arvind Kejriwal are freebies.
Reacting to AAP's victory, Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad gave a clear message that the BJP and Modi government at the Centre would keep a tab on AAP's assurances. "Kejriwal must deliver his promises," he said.
