White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman cited the jump in unemployment claims reported today as a sign that the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown and a possible default is having negative effects on the economy.
First-time claims for unemployment rose to 374,000 last week, 66,000 more than the previous week â€“ the largest one week jump since Superstorm Sandy. "You see increases that large only every couple of years," he told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Center for American Progress. "It's a very large increase."
