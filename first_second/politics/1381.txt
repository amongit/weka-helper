Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-WA) proposed today to build on the Earned Income Tax Credit's (EITC) pro-work success story by significantly boosting the credit for low-wage workers not raising minor children -- the only group that the federal tax code taxes into (or deeper into) poverty.
Chairman Murray also made clear today that Congress should lock in permanently the EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) improvements of the 2009 Recovery Act that policymakers later extended through 2017. These include critical marriage penalty relief in the EITC and a CTC expansion worth roughly $1,700 to a single mother of two working full time at the minimum wage.
