The fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the change propelled by the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a bloody March 15, 1965 Sunday in Selma, Alabama demands not only celebration but the nation's serious reflection. The absence of an indictment of former Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson for the death of an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown, on a Ferguson street in 2014 shows how much more the nation is yet required to change in order to fully realize liberty, justice and equality for all.
Since there is no video recording that completely and accurately memorializes the event which resulted in the death of Michael Brown, we are left, largely, to the self serving accounting of Officer Wilson himself about what propelled him to intentionally shoot and kill Michael Brown. The basic facts are simple. Officer Wilson, while driving his police vehicle, had just heard a police radio communication that a robbery had occurred in a store when he observed Michael Brown and a friend walking in the street. Officer Wilson drove up to the young men; words were exchanged; and, ultimately, Michael Brown was shot to death by Officer Wilson.
