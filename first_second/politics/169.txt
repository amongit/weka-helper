Current and former Republican governors considering 2016 presidential runs say that they have abided by their state laws when it comes to personal emails that included government business — putting them in the same boat as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has defended her use of a secret email account by insisting she complied with federal laws.
Mrs. Clinton’s claims have been challenged by open records experts, who say keeping her own private server and not turning over any emails until more than a year after she left office puts her in a unique category.
