Many Republicans in the consultant class regard the current demographic trends as the enemy. They cannot come up with solutions, with ways to integrate the party and its message into the future reality of what America will look like. Instead, most likely out of frustration, they stand on the sidelines and “curse the darkness,” arguing against efforts to broaden the base and make the party more inclusive.
It is not necessary that the GOP dilute its core message or compromise on basic principles in order to maintain its majority. America is still a center-right country. The party does not have to suddenly embrace tax increases or abortion on demand or gun control to remain competitive nationally; indeed, most of the available evidence suggests any movement in those directions would run counter to its long-term viability. What it does have to become is smarter, something that starts with making worthwhile investments in the political futures of candidates who will someday run for statewide office and who are not exclusively white, male and Protestant.
