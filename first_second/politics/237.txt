For some time, polls have found former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with higher negative ratings than one might expect of someone who has never before run for president or, until recently, maintained a high national political profile. In the newly released NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted March 1 through 5, among 1,000 adults nationwide, 34 percent of those who were asked how they felt about Bush had either "somewhat negative" (20 percent) or "very negative" (14 percent) feelings about him, with just 23 percent expressing positive impressions (4 percent "very positive," 19 percent "somewhat positive"). Bush's net rating (positive minus negative) on this personal thermometer was -11 points, putting him at the bottom of the list of the nine public figures (and one institution) the survey asked about. Bush's brother, former President George W. Bush, had a net rating of -4; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -1; President Obama +1; Federal Reserve Board Chairman Janet Yellen +6; Sen. Elizabeth Warren +7; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton +8; the U.S. Federal Reserve +10; and former President Bill Clinton +30.
While 86 percent of those who identified themselves as Democratic primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Clinton (13 percent could not), just 49 percent of Republican primary voters said they could see themselves supporting Jeb Bush (42 percent said they could not). Indeed, greater percentages of Republican primary voters were able to envision supporting Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, or Walker, or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, than could picture backing Bush.
