Washington (CNN)Vice President Joe Biden has long had a reputation as a gaffe machine. His series of unfortunate quotes began long before his time working in the White House, but this week in a single day, he managed to make twin gaffes that dominated the web.
While Biden's whisper to the new Defense Secretary's wife and his comment about Somali cab drivers may have sent Twitter aflutter, he can take solace in knowing that every potential candidate - from sitting presidents to also-rans - make gaffes too.
