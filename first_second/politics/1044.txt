One of the juicy conspiracy theories surrounding Eric Cantor’s epic collapse – first raised by Peter Roff in this space on Monday night – is the possibility that Democrats crossed over and voted in the open GOP primary just to mess with the GOP and possibly knock off the sitting House majority leader. Judging from a new poll issued today, we can likely put that theory to rest.
Americans for a Conservative Direction, a GOP group headlined by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, among others, which supports comprehensive immigration reform, released a poll today showing that only 22 percent of voters who supported David Brat – the David to Cantor’s Goliath – did so because of immigration reform. I’ll have more about that poll in a subsequent post.
