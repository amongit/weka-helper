A quartet of congressmen applauded Twitter for recently shutting down 2,000 accounts established by “foreign terrorist organizations” that are using an American-based social media company, they say, to fundraise, spread propaganda and recruit members.
But it’s not enough. Republican Reps. Ted Poe of Texas and Ed Royce of California, plus Democrats Brad Sherman of California and Eliot Engel of New York, don’t want to stop there. What about the other 46,000 Twitter accounts, as revealed in the “ISIS Twitter census,” a Brookings Institution metadata analysis? The researchers recommend that the U.S. government and private providers join forces to develop “appropriate responses to extremism” in social media.
