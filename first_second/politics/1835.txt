I recently took part in a very stimulating event entitled Saint-Petersburg Conference on World Affairs which took place in Florida on the campus of South Florida University. I had the pleasure of listening to Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian winner of the Nobel Prize for literature and Joshua Landis an expert on Syria. This conference was organized by a now retired diplomat, Douglas McElhaney, and the name of the city is, of course, of particular interest to anyone interested in Russia.
One of the panels dealt with the current Ukraine crisis, to use a somewhat neutral term. In the spirit of open dialogue it included a Russian academic who presented a Russian vision of the crisis and three other speakers who represented a somewhat muscular Western take on the issue. The panel was entitled, in a provocative way, "Russia after the Ukraine and Crimea Grabs: What's for Dessert?"
