WASHINGTON -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) suggested he supports legislation that would eliminate his state's 48 hour waiting period for handgun purchases in an Friday interview with NRA News.
"That's one of those where with new technology, it's real easy to make sure the bad guys donâ€™t get firearms, and the good guys do," Walker said, noting that in 2011 Wisconsin allowed residents to carry concealed weapons.
