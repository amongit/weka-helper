It remains to be seen whether President Obama signs onto the House GOP's plan to raise the debt ceiling for an additional six weeks â€“ the details of the plan are still unclear. Barring an agreement, the country is a week away from defaulting (regardless of what the debt ceiling deniers might claim). What would this mean?
Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, gave a pretty good description of one aspect of the crisis this morning. He noted that November is usually the second worst month of the year in terms of the deficit between what the government spends and what it takes in. In November 2012, for example, the government had $172 billion more in expenditures than it did in revenue. So using that figure as an example, you would have to cut spending by $172 billion in a single month.
