Political bigwigs gathered in St. John's on Saturday night to toast — and roast — Newfoundland and Labrador's former lieutenant governor John Crosbie and his wife, Jane.
The event was part of the Rotary Club of St. John's Northwest's 11th annual gala dinner and auction fundraiser at the Delta Hotel.
