A record number of defendants were exonerated of crimes in 2014, according to The National Registry of Exonerations' annual report released Tuesday. Last year saw 125 exonerations, the most since 1989, when the registry — a project of the University of Michigan Law School — began tallying the number of people cleared of crimes for which they were wrongfully convicted.
Texas had the most exonerations last year, with 39, followed by New York with 17 and Illinois and Michigan with seven each. Additionally, there were eight federal exonerations last year.
