As Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) prepares for her new role as the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, she is gearing up a big fight with Republicans over women's reproductive rights.
Murray told The Huffington Post in an interview on Monday that even though some Republicans moderated their positions on abortion and birth control access during the midterm election, she expects the new GOP-led Senate to try to slash federal family planning funds, repeal the Affordable Care Act and ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
