After leading the charge against the House vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Children Protection Act, North Carolina Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers finds herself with a lot fewer friends in Washington than she had just weeks ago.
The proposed legislation stops abortions after 20 weeks – when modern science tells us babies in utero smile, suck their thumbs, and feel pain, among other human attributes – except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother would be jeopardized if the pregnancy were allowed to continue. It’s a common sense measure that enjoys broad support among Democrats and independents, as well as Republicans.
