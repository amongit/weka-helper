Washington, D.C. is an absolutely beautiful city. In fact, as someone who used to live "inside the Beltway" when I was one of tens of thousands of interns in the Washington area, I came to appreciate everything that America's capital city had to offer. The food is outstanding; the diversity of the city's population is a microcosm of the American population at large; most of the people I encountered were friendly, and the history is second to none. The only thing I despised was the summertime, when the blazing heat got up to the triple digits and the humidity was so bad that I at times felt like dropping dead on the sidewalk from exhaustion.
So, when you hear the common refrain about Americans hating Washington, they aren't talking about the city in general. Rather, they are referencing the politicians, lobbyists, campaign staffers, and the black-and-white, us-versus-them partisanship of U.S. politics. There is a reason why Congress rarely gets above 25 percent in the approval ratings -- tens of millions of Americans are tired of the snark, backstabbing, the hypocrisy and the near-ending name calling that we have all come to expect on House of Cards (Season 3 coming this week!)
