Last month the "Corinthian 15," in collaboration with the Debt Collective, announced that they would not pay the debts they had accrued while enrolled at schools run by for-profit corporation called "Corinthian Colleges Inc." Corinthian, which had more than 70,000 students enrolled in its schools last year, collapsed amid a cloud of allegations after failing to meet regulatory requirements. Many students were caught with unfinished educations as well as mounting debt.
