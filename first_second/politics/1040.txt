Texas Gov. Rick Perry was nowhere near prepared to run for president two years ago – so says Texas Gov. Rick Perry. So he’s now preparing to run in 2016 even as he works through the process of deciding whether to actually do so.
He needs to keep preparing, apparently: He admitted Thursday that he “stepped right in it” with his recent comments comparing homosexuality with alcoholism, which he cited, without prompting, as an example of “being deflected over onto this social issue or that social issue” – something Republicans need to avoid, he said, instead focusing on jobs.
