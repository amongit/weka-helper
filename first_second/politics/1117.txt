Add Orrin Hatch to the Bill Clinton fan club. Hatch this morning hearkened back to the Clinton administration and said that President Obama's Democratic predecessor was a "pretty darn fine president" – in spite of "some other difficulties" which the Utah senator didn't need to enumerate.
It used to be that people would talk about Republicans (mostly) having Clinton Derangement Syndrome (an expression apparently derived from the "Bush Derangement Syndrome," with which Charles Krauthammer diagnosed Democrats in 2003) for their irrational hatred of all things Clinton. Now I wonder if Hatch has a strain of a new affliction – Clinton Nostalgia Syndrome? – that seems to be infecting conservatives.
