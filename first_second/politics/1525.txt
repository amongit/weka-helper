In his first interview since November's presidential election, Mitt Romney compared the end of the 2012 campaign to the sensation of getting off a roller coaster.
"We were on a roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs," Romney told Fox News' Chris Wallace in an interview set to air on Fox News Sunday on March 3. "But the ride ends. And then you get off. And it's not like, oh, can't we be on a roller coaster the rest of our life? It's like, no, the ride's over."
