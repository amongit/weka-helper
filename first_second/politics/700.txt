The recent protests and conversations over #blacklivesmatter show the United States is in no way post-racial. The debate rages on as both sides ask, “Is America’s criminal justice system colorblind?” The best way to know is to look at the data.
First, the U.S. is insanely good at throwing its citizens in the brink. Really, we are. With only 5 percent of the world’s population, we house 25 percent of all prisoners, which makes the country the world’s biggest jailer. The problem has only been getting worse: The prison population has increased by 700 percent since 1970, meaning one in every 31 adults is under some sort of correction, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The U.S.’s love of throwing people behind bars is also expensive – the annual cost per inmate is $21,006 for minimum security and $33,930 for high security, according to the Urban Institute.
