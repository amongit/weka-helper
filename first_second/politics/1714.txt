Democrats keep trying to drive our country forward with policies designed to help Americans in the 21st century. Unfortunately, Republicans are stuck in reverse.
Attorney Louise Raggio drafted and helped pass the Texas Marital Property Act of 1967, affording married women the right to own property, secure a bank loan and start a business without their husband's consent. Now in 2015, many Republicans harken back to "the good ol' days" and propose laws stripping women of the right to make appropriate health care decisions with their doctors and families. Abortions were once performed mainly in back alleys and by unskilled practitioners. Do we really want to revert back to those days?
