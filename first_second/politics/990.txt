Controversial figure U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will be stepping down from his post, it was learned Thursday, leaving the Obama administration as soon as his replacement can be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Those who cannot see past race – and thus tend toward wanting to inflate Holder’s grade – are praising his tenure in office, lauding the attention he gave issues like civil rights and the manner in which, as NBC’s Chuck Todd suggested shortly after the news broke, managed to stay above politics.
