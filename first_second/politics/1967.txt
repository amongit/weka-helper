Another Russian is dead: Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader and harsh critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is murdered in Moscow on Friday, February 27, 2015, one day before he is to lead a protest against the policies of Putin. "Life has no meaning in Russia," said Natasha Fissiak, director of a new film Pussy Riot - The Movement, screened in New York City and in Houston, Texas, one day before Nemtsov is killed.
Was she prescient? No more than Pussy Riot who profanely and presciently warned the world about Putin. Nor Masha Gessen, a renowned Russian journalist who fled Russia and who said in the documentary, "Putin is not just a crook and a thief. Putin is a murderer and dictator."
