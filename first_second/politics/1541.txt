For the first time ever the Republican Party invited a Sikh American leader to offer an invocation at their national convention in Tampa, Fla. last week. Ishwar Singh, head of the Sikh Society of Central Florida, delivered the invocation. HuffPost Religion is honored to publish the full text of his invocation, which was cut in half by the RNC coordinators.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
