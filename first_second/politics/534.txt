Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) admitted on Sunday that he had completely changed his stance on immigration and that he now has a much tougher position on undocumented individuals living in the United States.
"I don't believe in amnesty, and part of the reason why I've made that a firm position is I look at the way this president has mishandled that issue," Walker said during an interview on "Fox News Sunday."
