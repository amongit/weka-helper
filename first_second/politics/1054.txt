President Barack Obama presents quite a dilemma for Democratic candidates this year. They can’t run away from him, but given his upside down approval ratings (43 percent approve and 52.8 disapprove, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls) do any dare run with him? One top House Democrat gave the answer as a resounding yes this morning.
“The president has offered to be there and I’m confident that he will continue to be there,” Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen said. “It’s very important to have the president fully engaged as he’s more than willing to be.” When I asked him if he thinks Obama is welcome on the trail by Democrats, Van Hollen said that he will be. “I think he is,” the lawmaker said at a press breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. “As you know every state and every district is a little different, but if the number one priority here is to make sure that the Democrats get out the core vote then my view is that having the president out there on behalf of candidates is very important, reminding Democratic voters of the unfinished business that is before us.”
