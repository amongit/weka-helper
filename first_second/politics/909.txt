It's the season for political gaffes, when politicians step into what former President George H.W. Bush called "deep doo-doo."
Sometimes the gaffes are momentary lapses brought on by fatigue, lack of discipline or a misplaced attempt to be funny. These mistakes may be good for a laugh or two, but have little or no larger meaning. Yet sometimes gaffes provide important insights into the candidates and their surrogates--their quirks, character, vulnerabilities, and innermost feelings.
