House Republicans started the shutdown clock ticking today with a bill that would fund the government through the end of the year but defund Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act). The question facing the political class now is: Will they or won't they? Do they have the guts – the sheer will – to do what's right, or faced with a government shutdown, will they cave and fall back on familiar, squishy positions.
I refer, of course, to the media.
