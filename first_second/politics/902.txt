President George H.W. Bush got it right. He used prudence, restraint and empathy to facilitate the unraveling of the Soviet Union and the fall of the infamous Berlin Wall 25 years ago. That's when citizens of a divided Germany began dismantling the wall, which had become the hated symbol of cold war divisions in Europe, the totalitarianism of the Soviets, and the goal of communist leaders to keep their people trapped inside the borders of their stifling and thuggish states.
And history has proven the wisdom of Bush's approach.
