Anyone who still holds on to the notion that American justice is impartial and resolute in the pursuit of truth should prepare to have their illusions shattered. Despite the time-tested maxim that people are presumed innocent until proven guilty, it is too often the case, especially in high-profile white collar matters like Enron and the indictment of public officials like former United States Sen. Ted Stevens, that the accused must be guilty. It practically says so in the news, so few people ask additional questions.
Unfortunately, as former assistant U.S. attorney Sidney Powell documents in her new book, " Licensed to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice," the wheels of government have been slowly grinding down the innocent as unsupervised prosecutors distort evidence, make up criminal changes and impede the search for truth in exchange for convictions that will boost their careers.
