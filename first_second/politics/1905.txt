When he won his first election four years ago, he promised to restore America's reputation in the world. But as he starts his second and final term following a strong election victory last night, president Barack Obama resumes service in the White House with a reputation abroad as a hard-nosed leader who killed Osama Bin Laden and who sent drones to pursue extremists in far-flung places. For a president who was seeking to remake American's image, however, popular opinion of Obama in the Muslim world deteriorated as rapidly as political systems there changed.
During the presidential campaign, Obama did not trade much on his strongman credentials. He projected himself more as the responsible, realist leader who managed US foreign policy on a tightrope. As he begins his second term, will Obama revert to type or will he be able to live up to the rhetoric of 2008?
