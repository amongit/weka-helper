MADISON, Wis. – We are talking the mid-sixties. I was an outspoken small girl and he was a serious young man. Had we met, I’m sure I’d have set him straight. Well, maybe not, but how out of place he seems here in progressive Madison, my hometown.
Dick Cheney and I go way back to this green and blue university city set on the waters of Lake Mendota. Yet I never saw him hanging out on the Memorial Union Terrace in high July, looking out on the lake swimming with sails, or enjoying a high-dairy ice cream experience. Nor did he consort with the Rathskeller radicals.
