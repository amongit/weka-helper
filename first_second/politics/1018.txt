Has everyone noticed how, any time one of the Clinton crowd faces trouble from a woman, one of their spin doctors immediately moves to the “little bit slutty, little bit nutty” line of attack? Their latest target is Virginia Delegate Barbara Comstock, now the Republican nominee in the state’s open 10th congressional district, whom veteran Clinton operative Paul Begala is now calling a stalker.
Referring to her past work as a congressional staffer investigating alleged White House lawbreaking during the Clinton years, Begala said Comstock has a “really almost sick, sort of stalker-like obsession with President Clinton,” Politico reported Thursday.
