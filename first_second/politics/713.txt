Global health costs related to obesity are believed to rack up about $2 trillion each year – nearly 3 percent of the world’s total GDP – according to a report published recently by McKinsey Global Institute consulting firm.
The report estimates about 2.1 billion people, or nearly 30 percent of the world’s population, are either overweight or obese. Up to 20 percent of health care costs in some developed countries are attributed to treating obesity or associated complications, according to the report.
