Turns out there's a close precedent for the spectacle of a poisonously contrary opposing party urging Americans and foreigners alike to ignore the sitting U.S. president. But we must reach back all the way to George Washington and the 1790s, says a leading scholar.

Calling Washington a traitor, the Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, tried to defund a treaty he had negotiated with the British.
