Barbarism, By Any Other Name: Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder says hectoring of the Obama administration over whether to use the word “terrorism” is a sideshow over semantics and a ratings vehicle for Fox News, without which “they would have nothing else to talk about, it seems to me.” Speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday, Holder said that debate’s a distraction from the real issue: what to do about extremist groups like the Islamic State group, Boko Haram and various al-Qaida offshoots that have sprung up like dandelions, are about as difficult to get rid of and way deadlier.
Bad Numbers: The debate’s not entirely hollow for Holder’s boss, President Barack Obama, who’s struggling to find a coherent way to fight a stateless, nihilistic adversary and keep the public on his side. And these days, both goals are looking further out of reach: a new CNN/ORC public opinion poll shows a clear majority of the public isn’t feeling great about Obama’s strategy to defeat the Islamic State. That’s not a good look when Obama’s trying to win approval of his Authorization of Use of Military Force amid some rough headlines – including last week’s death of Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old aid worker and the Islamic State’s first known female American hostage, and the beheading of more than 20 Egyptian Christians over the weekend.
