It may not qualify as stop-the-presses news to say that the Republican Party takes its cues from the tea party movement, but the progressive group Americans United for Change has some interesting statistics to bear out that belief.
The group is set to release a study today looking at how Republican House members in swing districts have voted in comparison to the tea party. The topline figure: GOP lawmakers in these swing districts voted with the tea party movement 81 percent of the time last year. “The Republican Party and the tea party in terms of governance and in terms of politics are basically indistinguishable,” says Brad Woodhouse, the group’s president.
