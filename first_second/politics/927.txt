NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. – Don’t believe the narrative that the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination has come down to a contest between former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and current Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. That’s just media hype, created to give writers something to write about and pundits something to talk about when they’re not beating up on President Barack Obama or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The field of potential GOP candidates is both wide and deep, intellectually as well as politically. It includes governors, former governors, a couple of United States senators and a few political outsiders, all of whom has passionate followings that could shake up the race.
