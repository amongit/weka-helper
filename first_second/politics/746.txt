It takes a mad man to go green to the Emmys. But somebody’s got to lead a vanguard of bicyclists clad in black ties right up to the red carpet, to mix into the parade of limos and beautiful people in expensive gowns and suits, right? What better place to say bicycling is the old new thing?
That somebody is Emmy nominee Tom Smuts, a writer and producer for "Mad Men," the hit show about the 1960s up for best drama. “Who am I? Just a scrivener,” he says to me. Tom is my brother-in-law; he went from working as a lawyer to a screenwriter and knows a ton. The 48-year-old also knows the power of a good idea and quickly rounded up riders to create a cause, surrounded by buzz. The caper made the front page of the Los Angeles Times and gained the nod of the Television Academy.
