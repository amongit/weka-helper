The president is obliged, according to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, to "from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient." For most of our history presidents saw fit to do this with written rather than spoken messages.
But Woodrow Wilson saw the potential in delivering the message as a speech and as the presidency entered its modern form – driven by the spoken word and the televised visual – the report has become an annual event, replete with its own hoary rituals (who's sitting in the first lady's box this evening?) and attendant hype.
