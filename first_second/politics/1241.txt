Four Things and a Cartoon, CPAC Edition:
Jeb in the Lion’s Den: Jeb Bush’s entrance into the Conservative Political Action Conference's steel cage of death on Friday would, arguably, provide the highest drama of the feel-good convention so far, and the first theoretically hostile audience he’s faced since actively considering exploring the possibility he could perhaps run for president in 2016. On Thursday the crowd booed lustily when his name came up; the Gadsden Flag Guy talked of leading a walkout. When Bush hit the stage to the pop smash, “Uptown Funk,” half the audience applauded; as Sean Hannity began the interview, Flag Guy hoisted his standard, and some shouted “Common Core!” but the rabble-rousing those ended a few minutes in, and the walkout evaporated. Bush ended up performing well, handling what passes for hardball questions on immigration and even explaining his decision to support Common Core -- without getting rotten fruit or rocks thrown at his head. Nice performance tThat should quiet the critics, for now.
