President Barack Obama's reelection effort still owes $3.1 million five months after running the most expensive presidential campaign in history, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.
The campaign committee's debt load dropped from $5.8 million at the end of 2012 to a little over $3 million at the end of March. Obama for America also pulled in $4.4 million in the first three months of 2013 to help pay off its debts. That is just below the $4.8 million raised by a spin-off nonprofit run by former Obama campaign aides, called Organizing for Action.
