NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. – I generally think presidential preference polling more than two years before the election is silly – it’s little more than a test of name recognition and has little predictive value (remember 2008 GOP frontrunner Rudy Giuliani). But today’s ABC News/Washington Post poll has one instructive data point worth pulling out, and it’s bad news for Jeb Bush boosters.
The poll tested 10 potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton and nine Republicans, asking whether respondents “definitely would” vote for the candidate, “would consider” voting for the candidate or “definitely would not” vote for the candidate. No great surprise that Clinton – presumably the best known – got the highest marks.
