WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told Republicans Wednesday morning that unless they remove an anti-abortion provision from a bill on human trafficking, the popular legislation is doomed.
"Today, the Senate is doing a good deed. We have a chance to address human trafficking," said Reid in remarks on the Senate floor. "In this legislation that is meant as an outline to stop child trafficking and human trafficking generally, there is a provision in this legislation dealing with abortion. It has nothing, nothing to do with this."
