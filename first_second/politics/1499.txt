As the presidential campaign moves into its final two weeks and the candidates crisscross the country focusing mostly on the economy, I've been frustrated by how little attention education has received on the campaign trail. Often candidates for national office spend more time talking about issues of dollars and cents than they do about improving our education system because it seems that's where the voters are focusing their attention. We know, though, that there is a strong relationship between economic growth and a world-class education system. A recent Tom Friedman column drew this connection exceptionally well. Friedman zeroes in on the paramount importance of obtaining some form of a postsecondary education because, "technology and globalization are wiping out lower-skilled jobs faster, while steadily raising the skill level required for new jobs. More than ever now, lifelong learning is the key to getting into, and staying in, the middle class."
Recently, I've had several opportunities to speak with education leaders from some of the highest-performing countries around the globe. They are perplexed by our challenges in the areas of teacher quality and developing world-class academic standards. The majority of high-performing countries have teachers who join the profession from the elite universities and enjoy a level of prestige reserved for lawyers, doctors, and engineers in the United States.
