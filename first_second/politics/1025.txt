A new year brings new U.S. and world population totals. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual projections, the United States will enter 2015 with 320,090,857 people while the planet Earth overall will have more than 7.2 billion living souls on it.
Overall the U.S. remains firmly entrenched as the third most populous country in the world, behind China (nearly 1.4 billion) and India (nearly 1.3 billion) and ahead of Indonesia (nearly 256 million). The U.S. population is 2,334,187 people larger than the start of 2014, according to the Census Bureau; that’s a 0.73 percent increase from last year, which is pretty much in line with the last few years. The year 2010 saw a slight dip (0.6 percent) and 2009 saw a veritable baby boom (0.9 percent – I suppose people had nothing better to do when the economy crashed, and they lost their jobs).
