Three Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon)
Black Lives Matter: It’s been almost eight months since a deadly encounter between a white Ferguson, Missouri, cop and an unarmed African American teenager touched off a painful but long-overdue national conversation about race, use of force and police bias. The protests are largely gone but FBI Director James Comey took the conversation to the next level Thursday when he told a Georgetown University audience that everyone carries bias, police often make “sinister associations” when they see young black men, and those associations are part of a checkered history between law enforcement and the African American community. It was a bold speech for Comey, particularly considering the withering criticism that Attorney General Eric Holder, his boss, and President Barack Obama endured when they waded into the racial elements of the Ferguson shooting. It remains to be seen whether Comey, who is white, will be similarly excoriated.
