The latest numbers for sign-ups through the federal health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act show the government is just a quarter of the way to its goal of 9 million enrollees.
The Congressional Budget Office originally predicted 2015 open enrollment – the second round of enrollment under the law – would bring 13 million sign-ups. Days before sign-ups began on Nov. 15, officials with the Department of Health & Human Services projected enrollments to reach between 9 and 9.9 million.
