I waded into a cool sea of 200 souls downtown, a caffeinated collection gathered to chat about the movement on Saturday morning – some in town for the White House Correspondents Dinner. Okay, most were white men with privilege to check, but other than that, the room was right on the progressive edge. The energized sound of speakers voices as one after another engaged with the throng in short staccato sessions was striking and I'll tell you why: The gay rights movement is about the only winning social movement in town and country these days. Just ask Randi Weingarten, the head of the teachers union, she's over there.
Cynthia Nixon, the "Sex in the City" actress, and Bishop Gene Robinson (the first openly gay Episcopal Bishop) provided some of the star power, but this event was more free-for-all than tightly scripted. Welcome to The Atlantic and National Journal's LGBT@WHCD editorial briefing – or was it a debriefing? "It's a grassroots D.C. confab," said Steve Clemons, who pulled the thing together in five days. Clemons is the Washington editor-at-large for both magazines. Standing over six feet, he sported an apron as if the ideas up in the air were still being cooked. "Everyone's surprised at the power of this."
