Sunday's morning shows featured some astoundingly stupid comments from Republicans who claim to believe that on Election Day voters gave them a "mandate" to continue their attempts to obstruct President Obama's agenda.
Apparently some Republican pundits are still living in the same parallel universe that allowed them to convince themselves that by now, President-elect Mitt Romney would be organizing his transition.
