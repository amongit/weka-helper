But of course they do! Everybody knows that there are 3rd Party candidates running for President. But where can you learn about them? How do you know their names, their platforms and who they are? You cannot! That is, unless you access what has been termed "the alternative media", also known as the "media voice of the People", and the "Media that is more interested in impartial reportage and truth than bias and pushing a partial agenda..."
Despite the fact that We the People own the airwaves, you would never know it. They have been so sliced and diced by the FCC among their corporate sponsors that what should be "fair and balanced" on behalf of the American People, that is, equal coverage among substantial candidates, in my view, is anything but it.
