Three Things You Should Know (And a Cartoon)
Kill Switch: When the Utah state legislature recently approved a new law allowing condemned inmates the option of facing a firing squad instead of dying through a lethal injection, it raised more than a few eyebrows. But fans and foes of the death penalty say it’s a turning point in the decades-long debate over state-sponsored executions, spurred in part by international opposition to what the world sees as uniquely American barbarism. As states run out of the specialized, highly-sophisticated cocktail used to kill death-row inmates more “humanely” – the European Union has banned export of the key drugs used in lethal injection – authorities are turning to more primitive forms of execution, including the electric chair (Tennessee just passed a bill allowing it) and the gas chamber (Oklahoma’s considering it after two botched executions last year).
