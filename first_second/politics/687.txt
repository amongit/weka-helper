Actions by President Barack Obama opening relations between the United States and Cuba follow almost two decades of softening American opinions toward the country.
When Gallup surveyed Americans in 2014, 38 percent said they had a favorable opinion toward Cuba, up from 10 percent in 1997. Since 1974, Americans have been largely in favor of re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. In Gallup's most recent poll from 2009, 60 percent favored those policies and 30 percent said they opposed such policies.
