In a few seconds, it was all over. On that brisk Oct. 2013 morning, a large group of us --ranging from students and young professionals to seasoned retirees and a mother ranging in age from 20 to 68 -- had scurried up to two halted prison buses filled with shackled migrants off the local I-10 Tucson, AZ freeway and locked our arms around the buses' front tires. After several hours of delay, the transport vehicles would not make their fateful destination that day, a few blocks away at the U.S. District Court of Arizona.
This morning the State of Arizona begins its criminal prosecution trial against us, providing another opportunity to impugn the ugly aspects of U.S. immigration and border enforcement policies.
