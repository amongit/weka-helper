Washington (CNN)The White House is extending a decidedly icy welcome to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of his controversial speech to Congress this week. And it has nothing to do with the weather in Washington.
Expecting Netanyahu to issue withering criticism of President Barack Obama's moves toward a nuclear deal with Iran, the White House is going on the offense, dispatching two high-profile officials -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- to rebut the prime minister in speeches Monday to AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby holding its annual conference in Washington.
