First of all, I am a Zionist because my parents were. Zionism was a pillar of our family religion. Both my parents were teachers of Hebrew in Brooklyn. When they retired in the late 1970s, they made aliyah. I followed suit, at age 40, a decade later. One day in Jerusalem, when my father was very old, I asked him when he first became a Zionist. "I was seven," he immediately said. "Not six or eight?" I teased. Seven, he insisted, when he was a boy in Latvia. It was 1919, and under the Treaty of Versailles "everyone around me was getting a country of their own. The Latvians, the Estonians, the Finns. I wanted one too."
