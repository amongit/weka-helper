The debt ceiling debate is going back to the future. According to published reports, Republican demands for raising the debt limit have gone from triumphal to, relatively speaking, trivial. In this regard, the question of attaching something to the debt ceiling has come full circle, with House Republicans seemingly trying to return to the sort of minor league, palliative add-on that used to ease this politically difficult vote. But don’t count on the GOP being able to put that particular genie back in its bottle.
The debt ceiling has been suspended since an October deal cut by President Obama and Republicans. When that suspension ends – tomorrow – Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will commence using the extraordinary budget tricks available to him to keep the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. He announced Monday that those maneuvers will run out by the end of the month, meaning that Congress and the president have basically three weeks to raise the limit. Failing to do so would cause grievous harm to not only the U.S. economy but the global economy.
