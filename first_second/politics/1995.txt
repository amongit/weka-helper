Fifty years after "Bloody Sunday," the fight for voting rights continues in North Carolina.
After the 2013 Supreme Court decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, allowing jurisdictions to change voting laws without federal oversight, North Carolina passed a bill that placed new restrictions on the voting process. The law requires voters to show government-issued identification at the polls, shortens early voting, ends same-day registration and "increases the number of poll observers who can challenge a voterâ€™s eligibility," according to the LA Times.
