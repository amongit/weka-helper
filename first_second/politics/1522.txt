The president is likely to have a bad week with his progressive base, if what we are told to expect in his budget tomorrow turns out to be true. We are told that his budget will trade "modest entitlement savings," including future reductions in Social Security payments, for immediate tax hikes on the corporate rich. If that is so, the trade that will be proposed tomorrow will reflect poor judgment on the administration's part -- poor moral judgment, poor economic judgment and poor political judgment.
Such a trade will certainly be morally problematic. No matter how quickly Obama technocrats like Peter Orszag move to tell us that the changes proposed will only be slight, they will nonetheless bring reductions in the money made available to Social Security recipients over time. The trade being proposed, if what we are told is true, involve future cuts to a pension program for which people have already paid ahead of time (through payroll taxes on the wages they earned during their working lives): future cuts to a pension program, moreover, that for many low-paid workers and now low-paid pensioners is a vital lifeline in these difficult times. There is no parallelism here between the marginal impact on the lives of the rich that will come from any tax-hike acceptable to Republicans, and the significant impact on the lives of the elderly poor that any reduction in Social Security will inevitably bring. And because there is no parallelism, there should be no proposal that pretends otherwise. Indeed it will be doubly ironic if what ultimately saves us from this particular deal is not White House flexibility but Republican intransigence -- no chained CPI because its use fails to cut Social Security heavily enough!
