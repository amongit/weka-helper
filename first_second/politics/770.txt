Barack Obama and I go back to the same summer when we were born into the sixties, the age of Aquarius.
So we were young when "The Yellow Submarine" movie came out, when the moon landing happened and when Richard Nixon resigned. I have been marking him pretty closely since that euphoric, bone-and-blood chilling day five years ago when he was sworn in as president. He was the first of our generation, born after 1960, and we all had high hopes and dreams for him -- me and my beloved community.
