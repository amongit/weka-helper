There’s a lot that goes into the organization of a new Congress every two years, especially when control of a chamber passes from one party to the other. New committee ratios need to be set, staffing decisions need to be made, and chairman chosen for the dozens of committees and subcommittees that do the body’s actual work.
Prior to the 1994 election, decisions about who would lead what committee were pretty much on automatic pilot. With very few exceptions, like in the mid-1980s when the Democrats pushed Illinois Rep. Mel Price out of the chair of the House Armed Services Committee in favor of Wisconsin’s Les Aspin on the grounds that Price was no longer up to the job, the gavel was handed to the member with the most seniority.
