It sounds like the premise of a new political sitcom: two anti-science, climate change-doubting politicians take control of a pair of critical, science-based committees that deal with global warming, Hilarity ensues when minority Democrats, playing the wacky, meddlesome neighbors, try to thwart them as the ice caps melt and Florida and Texas slowly vanish.
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his fellow Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, just picked up chairman’s gavels at subcommittees whose portfolios collect data and record the planet’s changes, the cornerstone of the climate-change debate. Cruz now oversees the Senate subcommittee that oversees NASA, the atmosphere and science policy; Rubio now chairs the subcommittee with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -- one of the largest weather data-gathering organizations on the planet -- in its portfolio.
