Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Friday that he is "not even thinking about" running for vice president again in 2016.
Asked whether he would consider another bid if the GOP presidential nominee courted him for the role, Ryan answered, "That doesn’t happen twice. Name me a time … That doesn’t happen twice. I’m not even thinking about that."
