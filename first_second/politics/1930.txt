As I've launched my campaign to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate, I've made a special point of listening to a segment of the population to whom candidates don't often pay much attention: college students and recent graduates.
During a recent visit with students at the University of Cincinnati, I listened to several dozen undergraduates share their commitment to pursuing a college degree as an investment in their future. At the same time, they shared their dread in knowing that to attend college they'll pay a steep price for a long time.
