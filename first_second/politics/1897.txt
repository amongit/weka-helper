American presidential elections are always keenly watched in Israel, which prides itself on being the U.S. best ally in the Middle East, and one of the closest in the entire world. One poll some years ago showed 86 percent support for the U.S. in Israel. Some Israelis joked that the police should intervene and find out who are the missing 14 percent were... Jokes apart, friendship with the U.S. has always been high up on the agenda of Israel's political leadership and its electorate at large and Israeli election campaigns were often heavily concerned with the state of Israel-U.S. relations at their time.
Such was the case in 1992, when late PM Shamir and President George H.W. Bush bitterly collided in the aftermath of operation Desert Storm over American strong objections to Israeli using loan guarantees money originally designed to help in absorbing the huge influx of new immigrants from Russia also in the West Bank. Shamir, Likud's leader at the time, lost the elections, and polls taken during the campaign and later on clearly indicated that the Israeli public was distinctly dissatisfied With the crisis between the two countries, and reacted accordingly.
