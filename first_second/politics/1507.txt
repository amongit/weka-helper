The nation will soon decide who will lead our country for the next four years. No matter who wins, pundits will jump up with explanations of what were the make or break moments of the 2012 presidential campaign.
Hindsight, they say, is 20/20. After Kennedy won the 1960 election, pundits latched onto Nixon's physical appearance at the debates, focusing in on his unshaved, sweaty look and occasionally mentioning the voter turnout in Chicago. These same pundits point to Mike Dukakis sitting on a tank as the critical turning point in his campaign against George Bush. They recall Bill Clinton's saxophone playing performance and John Kerry not defending himself against the swift-boat attacks.
