Happy Thursday, the 29th day of 2015 and the fourth year and fifth month since President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act, aka The Sequester, a package of across-the-board, decadelong spending cuts that ended a standoff with Republicans in Congress who refused to raise the federal debt ceiling. Obama wants to roll back those cuts in his upcoming fiscal-year budget; he’ll announce that plan to Democrats huddled in Philadelphia.
