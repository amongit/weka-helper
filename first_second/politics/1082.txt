Tom Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wants to be very clear: Despite what you might have heard, he and his organization are not at odds with the tea party; they're just at war with the conservative cranks who want to shut down the government and toy around with the debt ceiling. You know, the tea party.
Speaking to reporters after delivering his annual "State of American Business" address this morning, Donohue tried some verbal gymnastics to distinguish between the tea party and the fringe nuts most people associate with it. You know how some music fans bemoan how their favorite band went corporate when they became too big? Donohue complains about something nearly the opposite regarding the tea party.
