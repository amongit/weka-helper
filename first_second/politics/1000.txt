Never mind that terrorist cells may be trying to “weaponize” the bubonic plague. The big story is the “hack” that let nude photos of dozens of famous women – some of whom are primarily famous because they are willing to be seen naked – out onto the Internet.
Trust me. People were not logging on after a long Labor Day weekend to search for “virus” and “ISIS” and other terms that will help them comprehend the pending potential threat. No, they were typing “Kate Upton,” “Kaley Cuoco,” and “Jennifer Lawrence” followed by the words “nude” or “naked” into their Web browsers.
