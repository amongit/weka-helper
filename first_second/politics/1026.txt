FISHERS ISLAND, N.Y. – One Christmas Eve, when my son Emmet was just shy of seven months old, I sat him on my lap and inaugurated what I was determined would be an enduring father-son tradition: I read Clement Moore’s “A Visit From St. Nicholas” (known more commonly by it’s opening line: “’Twas the night before Christmas…”). Young Emmet had not yet grasped the significance of the Christmas season and was not interested in sitting in Dada’s lap; he squirmed and cried while I held him tightly on my lap – this was going to be a fun tradition, by god – reading about the jolly old elf and his reindeer with a rising voice, finally wishing “all a good night” above his crying.
