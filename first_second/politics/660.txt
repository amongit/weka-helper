Americans can't watch anything without second screening. After all, if you weren't tweeting during last night's State of the Union address and the rebuttals that followed, you missed the bread bag shoe incident. Twitter users also (mostly) sent messages reacting to Obama's policy proposals and fact-checking his speech in real time.
Twitter has created a visualization from tweets during President Obama's speech, that graphs tweets by location and topic. Scroll through the speech to see how Twitter reacted. Explore the visualization full-screen here.
