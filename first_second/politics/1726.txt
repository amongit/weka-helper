A silver lining in an otherwise opaque regional cloud, Tunisia has adopted a liberal constitution guaranteeing religious freedom and equality of the sexes. Its citizens have now voted in two successful parliamentary elections, and for the first time this December they freely elected a president. Tunisia's transition to democratic stability provides a compelling story for potential investors seeking to leverage the country's political progress.
It is no secret that North Africa has tremendous economic potential -- the Maghreb has long been viewed as a gateway to Sub-Saharan Africa and to Europe.
