As 2014 fades into its waning hours, the dawn of college football bowl game season is upon us. Sports broadcasts for the next 3 1/2 weeks will be packed with 76 teams, 38 bowl games, a newly-formatted national championship and a constant, humbling reminder that every broken tackle, every seemingly-impossible reception and every goal-line stand in these NCAA bowl games will be performed by a group of kids in their late-teens or early-20s.
But rest assured, no matter how old that 18-year-old true freshman makes you feel as he breaks into the end zone on national television, college bowl games have been around a lot longer than you have.
