Have you heard the news? Take heart: President Barack Obama's golf game is getting better.
Well, I think we can all rest easier tonight. A shout-out to The New York Times for reporting this backstory with proper gravitas. From the sound of it, Obama's intensity about playing golf approaches President Dwight Eisenhower's. Swinging "Ike" left the presidency the same year Obama was born, 1961, so they have a cosmic connection â€“ a link, so to speak. And you thought the Republican five-star general and the Democratic freshman senator didn't have anything in common. (They also have Kansas is common.)
