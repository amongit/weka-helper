Elections, victors are prone to crow, have consequences. Today that gibe carries a tragic truth. One consequence of our recent elections will be deaths -- many deaths. A few thousands or tens of thousands, if we are lucky, millions if we are not. Let us specify some of the ways.
Twenty-three states have refused to expand Medicaid coverage to a combined total of about 4 million citizens, even though they are enabled to do so at minimal expense by the Affordable Care Act. They will be encouraged by the election to keep refusing, although we do not know how many will succumb to fiscal sanity and at least a minimal level of concern for the welfare of their citizens to finally expand their coverage later. Some portion of those 4 million citizens could die due to inadequate health care, although it is, of course, impossible to estimate just how many until some time has passed and we have more data on those who have been covered and those who have not been covered and who has survived or succumbed to their states' indifference. Secondary effects -- resulting from such things as thrusting people into irredeemable debt or bankruptcy, leaving children homeless or parentless, and driving parents or other caregivers to drugs or alcohol, will assuredly be present and will bring their own share of deaths, but the deaths will be even harder to predict before they happen or to count afterward. Those whose policies caused the deaths will therefore, as usual, be able to escape accountability and prattle self-righteously about abstract principles that serve only to disguise their savagery.
