TGIF, the 65th day of 2015 and the fifth month since President Barack Obama launched a second-term red-state tour, high-profile visits to underscore where his initiatives are working in Republican territory. He’ll visit Columbia, South Carolina, on Friday for a town-hall meeting at Benedict College, looking to sell his higher-ed proposals and take a bow for some impressive job-creation numbers.
