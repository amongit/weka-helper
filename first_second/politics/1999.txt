Fifty years after Bloody Sunday, I marched to the top of the Edmund Pettus Bridge with Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman John Lewis, President Barack Obama, and many others.
It was a special moment. I lead a think tank founded in the aftermath of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to serve elected officials of color--the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies (click here for our new voting rights report with numbers on minority turnout and elected officials over the last 50 years). I also teach and write on voting rights as a professor at The George Washington University Law School.
