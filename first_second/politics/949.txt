Daimler AG’s decision to move the U.S. headquarters of its Mercedes-Benz division from Montvale, New Jersey – where it has been since 1972 – to a site in the suburbs outside Atlanta is yet another sign that the rules of the old economic order are being rewritten thanks to the demands of the new economy.
While once quite different from the states on either side of it New Jersey has become a haven for the same kind of tax, spend and regulate approach to government that hampers the business climate in places like New York, long considered the East Coast archetype of the liberal welfare state.
