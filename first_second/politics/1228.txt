It’s Monday, the 68th day of 2015 and 21 months since the Supreme Court invalidated key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congress passed a bill, and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law, five months after the nation – and the world – saw Selma, Alabama, police attack Martin Luther King Jr. and Rep. John Lewis, then a student activist, on the Pettus Bridge as they demanded the right to vote for African Americans. On Saturday President Barack Obama, in a powerful speech, called on Congress to take action on a current bill that would renew – and strengthen – the law, which President George W. Bush reauthorized in 2006. But the current bill, drawn up after the Supreme Court ruling, has languished in Congress for months, and the Republican majority is unlikely to act (see below).
