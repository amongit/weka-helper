Despite being offered the opportunity of his dreams, President Barack Obama’s former top adviser David Axelrod says he turned down working on Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign because he “knew it would destroy [his] family.”
While discussing his new memoir Believer: My Forty Years in Politics on HuffPost Live, Axelrod said he feels a “sense of guilt for devoting so much time to politics" and not always being there for his wife and children. He said turning down Clinton in the early 1990s wasn't easy, but he knew taking the job would have a negative impact on his family.
