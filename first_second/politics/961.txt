Tensions are high in the Big Apple after a Staten Island grand jury concluded that no indictment should be brought against the New York City police officer accused of having caused the death of Eric Garner in July.
It's a tough call. The incident was captured on a cellphone video that appears to show white police officer Daniel Pantaleo using a banned chokehold to bring down Garner, an African-American man who was reportedly asthmatic and weighed some 350 pounds. It took four officers to bring him down during the attempted arrest, meaning itâ€™s not easy to determine whether the police employed excessive or unnecessary force.
