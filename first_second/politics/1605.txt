As the Supreme Court listened to arguments over subsidies in the state exchanges, Democrats were making their plans for preemptive surrender. Many were warning that an adverse ruling would be the death of Obamacare.
There is no doubt that a ruling for the plaintiffs would be bad news. It would deny millions of people subsidies in the states without their own exchanges. If the situation is not quickly remedied, it will also lead to the collapse of the exchanges in these states, as more healthy people stop buying insurance. With only less healthy people in the insurance pool, the price of insurance is likely to become unaffordable to almost everyone.
