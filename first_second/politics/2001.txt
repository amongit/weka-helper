Former Secretary of State Colin Powell on Sunday said that black voters should vote lawmakers who support voter ID restrictions out of office.
Powell, who served as secretary of state under George W. Bush, said that he was troubled by the voter ID laws, but that that they were "hurdles that we can get over."
