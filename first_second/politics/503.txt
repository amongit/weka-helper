As we celebrated Black History Month and the 50th anniversary of Selma's Bloody Sunday -- as we saw President Obama and President Bush hand-to-hand on the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- Americans everywhere were reminded that race always matters in our nation's political discussions. We were also reminded that a diversity of views at political decision-making tables yields better understanding of difference, more appreciation of what this difference means to the making of public policy, and better inter-personal relationships and respect for cultural difference. Likewise, in this month, Women's History Month, it's important to remember that Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth, that other great suffragists −- whether white or African-American −- didn't advocate for suffrage for progressive women only, but for suffrage for every woman. They knew that every voice and every experience count in our political rooms. Their accomplishment reminds us that gender, like race, also always matters, regardless of political philosophy.
Yes, even when the women at the decision-making tables aren't advocates for women's equal rights or opportunity, or for more civil political behavior, today's limiting rationales for the benefits of women's political participation.
