Russian NHL hockey legend Slava Fetisov is no stranger to political conflict, as his harrowing time on the Russian men's hockey team in 1980 is well-chronicled. Fetisov says the players were essentially imprisoned by Russian officials, forced to train at all hours of the day for what would end up being a memorable silver medal in the 1980 Olympic games.
In a HuffPost Live interview Thursday, the now 56-year-old Fetisov said comparing that old Russian regime to the one in place now is a mistake.
