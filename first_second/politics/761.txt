Calling Cliven Bundy: If you only knew what George Washington would do to you. He'd have you throttled and arrested and then invite your armed militia "friends" to join you behind bars. Your ranch house might get burned down. The former general was not known for mercy to scoundrels.
Bundy's racist speech aside, we've seen this movie before in American history, in the original Wild West stand against the federal government. Bundy has started kind of an uprising in Nevada in defense of letting his cattle roam and graze freely on public lands. For years, he has not paid a penny in fees to the federal bureau that oversees lands that, in effect, belong to all of us. He is brazenly stealing from the common and defying federal authority.
