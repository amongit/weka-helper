After disappointing sales Black Friday weekend, retailers could face another headache heading into the holiday shopping season: too much inventory. But that means consumers – especially those who procrastinate – may benefit from retailers’ overzealous holiday outlook.
The National Retail Federation reported Sunday that Black Friday weekend sales were projected to decline to $50.9 billion this year from $57.4 billion in 2013 – a drop of 11 percent. While the figures suggest retailers could face a surplus of unsold inventory in December, the federation still was upbeat, noting how retailers are spreading out their discounts rather than dumping them all on Black Friday.
