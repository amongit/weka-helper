How little there is to celebrate about George W. Bush. How much there is to rue. Next to his son, his father's short presidency seems worth at least a short thank you note.
The younger Bush's presidential library fanfare calls for a reckoning before his rangers paint pretty lies the size of Texas all over the place. The squat man in the cowboy hat, Dick Cheney, was a useful reminder of the greatest one: you know, something about Iraq and WMD. Then came the war started under false premises and promises to the world community. After nine years, we left the country in shambles, like a trashed fraternity house, Bush's scene at Yale. The untold civilian death toll is kept hidden in the shadows.
