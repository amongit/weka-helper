Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says, "America is a very, very unhappy country" right now, and there doesn't seem to be much on the horizon to change the sour mood.
Garin added that, despite favorable signs about the macro economy, many Americans don't feel that they have benefited personally and say their incomes have been stagnant; many also say they are living "paycheck to paycheck."
