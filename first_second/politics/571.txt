This September I turn 60. As I enter The Final Third, I find myself dumbfounded about where the last 60 years have gone, and driven to take stock and sort it all out. In addition, I want to hedge my bets for the next 30. With nothing really big calling my name, I don't have much of a bucket-list. All I know is that I want to keep going and keep learning.
A few weeks ago I started researching others who were sharing this milestone with me. I've always paid close attention to the patterns and themes that are woven into the tapestry of life and I was interested in the subtle commonalities my fellow 1954 babies share. We came into the world smack-dab in the middle of the baby boom. This year, 2014, we turn 60. Who did I miss? Write me and tell me, especially if I missed you. I would love to hear about what life is like for you at 60. Here is my list of 60 turning 60.
