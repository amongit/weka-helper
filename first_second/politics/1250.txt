Three Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon):
California Dreaming: So this is a thing: Republicans wanted to run Condoleezza Rice as their candidate to replace Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who’s retiring at the end of her term. And with good reason, too: Rice took the top slot in a recent poll of potential candidates, besting Kamala Harris, California’s attorney general and the Dems’ rising star in the Golden State. But like Elizabeth Warren, the liberal heartbreaker who has said she absolutely, positively will not run for president, Rice says she’s not interested in running this time around, either. Politico reports Republicans had high hopes she’d say yes: as a black Republican woman with White House cred, she’d appeal to moderate and minority voters and help resurrect the party in Reagan’s home state. Because, apparently, that whole “big tent” thing the GOP’s been working on for a few cycles isn’t quite panning out.
