More than two-thirds of women who are treated for early stage breast cancer in the U.S. are getting radiation therapy for longer than they need to, instead of a less time-consuming version of the treatment that is considered by oncologists to be just as effective, a new study shows.
The American Society for Radiation Oncology approved a shorter course of radiation treatment in 2011 â€“ higher doses of radiation over three weeks instead of a lower dose over five to seven weeks. The shorter term is just as effective for women who haven't had chemotherapy before and who are over age 50, research shows.
