MADISON, Wis. - James Madison is often forgotten in the scheme of presidents, but I'm not saying he was a great or a good one, for he was not.
He was charisma-challenged and fled the British when they came marching to burn down his house late in the summer of 1814. General Ross and John Bull still felt bitter about the upstart American Revolution.
