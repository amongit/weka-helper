Hillary Clinton has gone public with an unusually candid assessment of the problems and pressures that a president must endure as she considers whether to run for the White House in 2016.
At times, Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination in opinion polls, sounded like she was soul searching about what to do. "I spent an hour with the president yesterday going over a lot of different issues," she noted Thursday in a Boston speech. "And I was thinking, sitting there in the Oval Office talking, that I've known a lot of presidents over the course of the last many decades ... And it is such a hard job ... It is such a challenging job. And you need people, starting in your family – but going to your friends, beyond a larger circle – who will really be there for you and continue to treat you like a human being."
