Arianna visited "Real Time With Bill Maher" on Friday to discuss Hillary Clinton's response to using a personal email account during her time as secretary of state.

"There is that sense that the press is always out to get her ... You could see it at the press conference; she was so pissed at the fact that she had to deal with that."
