(CNN)Park Rangers at the Lincoln Memorial see it almost every day: Tour guides telling eager visitors that the number of steps leading to the temple match Lincoln's age when he died; that his white hands send a message in sign language; and that you can see Robert E. Lee's face sculpted in the back of his head.
It's all bunk, National Park Service Ranger Michael Kelly told me during a recent visit. "It's not a fact."
