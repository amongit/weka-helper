Like life itself, vacations don't always turn out how we plan. One of the most unpredictable experiences I ever had was in the 1990s, when my boyfriend and I took a trip to Venezuela. We planned to explore one of South America's less-visited cities and also spend some leisure time on the beautiful Caribbean island called Isla Margarita. But a coup attempt (by a guy who'd later become Venezuela's president) threw a monkey wrench into our itinerary. Interestingly, what would happen in the years following this attempted coup d'etat in Venezuela would lead the nation into even more complex political times, and keep it off the Latin America tourism map for decades (which also explains why you don't see much about Venezuela on my Latin America travel blog, LatinFlyer.com). Here's what it's like to vacation during a coup d'etat -- and to have your trip affected by Hugo Chávez, before most people knew who he was.
