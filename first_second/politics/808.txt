A finely wrought new book by Kim Ghattas, The Secretary: A Journey with Hillary Clinton From Beirut to the Heart of American Power, reads like notes from aboveground, covering the hottest rock star to hit the earth on her endless world tour.
Backstage, on plane rides, taking questions from the people in far-flung places, in chummy tete-a-tete diplomacy with world leaders in Paris; it's all there to get a grip on what Hillary Clinton was up to as Secretary of State for the first term of Barack Obama's presidency. Earning accolades, but for what, exactly?
