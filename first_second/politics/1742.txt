Two weeks after Islamic extremist murdered my colleagues at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris, I feel now is the time to reflect on what their deaths mean to us. Why were their creative talents targeted ?
One thing I can assure you is that neither ISIS nor al-Qaeda require an excuse to murder the innocent or the creative (those who question or challenge their ideology). The very fact republics and democratic governments exist threatens them to the very core of their extremist ideology. Their desire to enslave women, maim, murder and use the Holy Koran as the excuse or impetus to perform these savage acts is actually a greater evil than democracy, or the ideology of western society could ever possibly impose.
