I know, I know, everyone loves Joe with the winning grin. Everyone but me with the long memory.
By Joe I mean Joseph R. Biden Jr., the affable vice president, who will be 74 if sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2017. It's a safe bet Clarence Thomas will still be kicking around this town then. They are forever locked in as the principal male characters in Washington's watershed drama on sexual harassment. The Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearing riveted the nation in the fall of 1991. (Thanks, George H.W. Bush.) Did Thomas intimidate Biden into cutting the hearing short without calling further witnesses?
