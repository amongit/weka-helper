Will Europe Ever Forgive Bosnia & Herzegovina?
Every year we commemorate the genocide, we expect that those who betrayed Srebrenica might this time ask for forgiveness from the survivors. Instead, much of Europe appears inclined to forget Srebrenica and punish all Bosnian & Herzegovinians ("BiH") for reminding it of its collective failure to prevent the genocide. As most of BiH's neighbors are already admitted to or move toward EU accession, BiH is left outside a closed-door. Bosnia did not put itself into the position of outsider, but rather was delivered as consequence of the failures after and during the war. The Srebrenica Genocide remains the most documented reminder of such failures, and evidences duplicity in commitment to human rights, the rule of law and equality among all of Europe's peoples, only half a century after the betrayals that culminated in the Holocaust.
