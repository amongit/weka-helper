Washington just had a momentous week, perhaps the best of the 21st century, measured in deeds. The mood is much as if a battle-hardened Henry V returned from the fields of Agincourt a few minutes ago.
Truly the capital city appears made anew in the days since President Obama took the oath of office again and gave his forceful second inaugural address. Remarkably, as the president redefined himself as one not to be lightly crossed, the Capitol and the Pentagon suddenly seemed to lean forward with the winter wind. Take, for example, lifting restrictions on military women in combat, which was a huge historic breakthrough. So was unveiling bipartisan immigration reform in the Senate. Hillary Clinton's bravura performance in testifying on Capitol Hill, her valedictory as Secretary of State, painted the administration in smart, crisp tones (even as she defended a debacle.) Sen. John Kerry, her successor, received rave bipartisan reviews. Sen.Dianne Feinstein also announced her new bill, a ban on assault weapons.
