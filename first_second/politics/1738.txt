Mahatma Gandhi would have applauded the good intentions underlying President Obama's recent remarks on religion and violence at the National Prayer Breakfast. He might have even agreed wholeheartedly with the President on the need to recognize that religion has been not only a source of conflict in history but also a force for peace, love, and justice. But where the Mahatma might have weighed his words so as to express the greatest love and the strongest truth, President Obama somehow ended up with a seemingly curt and judgmental assertion of blame. Specifically, his remark that Gandhi would be shocked by intolerance in today's India disappointed many in the country who expected a more informed and less disrespectful attitude from a 21st century U.S. President.
There are two aspects to the questions being raised about the President's comments in India. The first one is the obvious one about double standards. Was it appropriate for him to lecture Indians about how to run their country (he did this earlier too on the last day of his visit to the country) when he did not do that in Saudi Arabia, a country with far less religious freedom than India? Was it really brave of him to take a shot at India when he did not dare take a shot at lecturing the Chinese government about its record on religious freedom; an opportunity that wouldn't have been remiss considering he was sitting right next to the Dalai Lama? These are questions that are being widely asked, but those are not the only things we need to consider.
