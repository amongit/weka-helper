It's been more than 20 years since Hugo Chávez led his first coup attempts in Venezuela. But for travelers, the potential hassles and dangers of travel to Venezuela are similar, or likely worse (no wonder this South American nation doesn't show up much on my Latin America travel blog, LatinFlyer.com). My partner and I had the misfortune of vacationing in Caracas back in 1992, during one of Chávez's coup attempts. In part 1 of my Venezuela travel essay, I related the unbelievable experience of waking up in a city that had been invaded and where constitutional rights had been suspended. In this second installment, I recount what happened when we finally made it to the U.S. embassy, and what we were able to do when curfews finally were extended.
