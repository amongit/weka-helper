How did a son of Kansas, Kenya and Hawaii get to be such an Eastern elitist? That's a signature trait in the cool character of Barack Obama that we didn't see coming.
What we have is an outbreak of Ivy intellectual snobbery, stronger than any other president since John F. Kennedy. In this important respect, Obama's depth and diversity in nominees does not match President Bill Clinton's record. A man of the people, Clinton knew there were talented people all over the nation that did not go to Ivy League schools. Yet we are about to see Obama's narrowness play out again.
