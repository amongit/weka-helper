The midterm elections are nearing and it's time to talk politics, but more so, positive positions.
I am and have been a President Obama supporter since '08. I've never made a secret of that. But if you think for one second that I think he or any one individual being is the savior of this world, you are sorely mistaken. Today, I as a listed Democrat, and my siblings will work hard and contribute to the world and economy, not because of our politics, but because that's what productive and balanced humans do. Truthfully, if any one person deserves credit for the citizens we are, it might be my mother for instilling in us a strong work ethic, a desire to help others, and the determination to be good. Who we are and how we conduct ourselves has nothing to do with Barack Obama as our presidential choice and everything to do with our character.
