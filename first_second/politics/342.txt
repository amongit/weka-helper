Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress was a hot ticket in Washington, but the speech did no favors for his reputation in America. According to a Gallup poll, the Israeli prime minister's favorable rating among the American public fell by 7 percentage points after his address, while the number of people with an unfavorable assessment of him rose by 5 percentage points.
Netanyahu's popularity in the US had been on the rise in recent years, and his March 3 speech in the House chamber was decidedly pro-American, peppered with phrases such as "Thank you, America. Thank you for everything you've done for Israel." He took a hard line against Iran, criticizing a planned nuclear deal sought by the Obama administration. But the fiery rhetoric failed to impress.
