Conservationists used to celebrate zoos and the like for their ability to aid in the preservation of endangered species, their usefulness as a teaching tool so that people could learn more about the animal kingdom and because they were useful in explaining to children, who were enthralled by the sights and sounds and smells, that this was a big planet that needed to be shared.
No more, now that the so-called green movement has linked up with the fringes of the animal rights movement to create a leading wedge designed to put an end to zoological parks of all kinds.
