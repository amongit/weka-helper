In strategy sessions all over Washington, Democratic operatives are reaching for the panic button. They won’t say it publicly – it would be bad form to do so – but privately some of them are beginning to concede the battle for control of Congress is all but over, and the Republicans have won.
Just look at the last-minute movements in spending by the party and by liberal groups who have pulled out of a Senate race in Kentucky they expected to win in order to shore up vulnerable incumbents in Louisiana and Colorado – places they expected they would be safe. The polls may indicate otherwise – most all have many of the key races as too close to call or within the margin of error – but that depends on the validity of the numbers.
