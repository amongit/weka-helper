Who wrote that no man is an island? English poet John Donne was wrong some 400 years ago. The president is seeking refuge and peace on Martha’s Vineyard off Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Long ago, the English sea captain who discovered and charted the graceful curving island named it for his daughter Martha. Ever since, its blue sky and water aura is calming and clear, kind to men with daughters. Barack Obama needs to heal from the cuts of Washington warfare.
Actually, Obama is an island within an island now. He likes his own company. And he’s got briefing papers to read about the Islamic State. He’s also thinking, my kingdom for the Kurds?
