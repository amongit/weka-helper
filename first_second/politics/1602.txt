Not too long ago, polls suggested that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie could be a viable candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. However, support for Christie has dwindled, and few Republicans say they would consider voting for him.
A NBC/WSJ poll released Monday shows that only 32 percent of Republicans can see themselves supporting Christie for the presidential nomination.
