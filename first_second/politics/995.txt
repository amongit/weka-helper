Whether Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz “committed” an act of political courage at the recent inaugural summit called by the group In Defense of Christians is for others to judge. Some have called it simple common decency. Others suggest it might mark the beginning of the restoration of civility in the political life of the nation. A few have suggested it was just politics as usual, a form of grandstanding planned and executed for the benefit of re-transmission on the nightly news and YouTube.
Whatever deeper meaning the chattering class can divine from the event, Cruz was right when he told those hectoring and booing his remarks that if they could not stand with Israel and the Jews, he could not stand with them – mic drop – and left the stage. What happened at this particular conference – even though those hooting the Texas senator’s references to Israel were clearly in the minority – is a reminder to us all that anti-Semitism is not only alive and well, it’s making a comeback.
