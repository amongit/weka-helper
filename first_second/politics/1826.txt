Everyone's gearing up for the midterm elections, but AAUW and Running Start are also thinking about future ballots. And we want to see women on them.
Women are 51 percent of the population in the United States, yet they hold only 29 percent of all elected offices from county council to Congress. That breaks down to 10 percent of governors, 18.5 percent of members of Congress, and 24.2 percent of state legislators. In 24 states, a woman has never been elected governor, and four states have never sent a woman to either chamber of Congress.
