Valentine’s Day retail spending is expected to reach a record $18.9 billion this year, as an improving American economy frees up more funds for people to invest in gifts for their loved ones.
More than half (54.9 percent) of Americans at least 18 years old said they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day this year, though the percentage of those who recognize the holiday drops off after the age of 44, according to a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation.
