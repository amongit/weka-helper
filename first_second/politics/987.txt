Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus took the opportunity Thursday to explain just what the Grand Old Party is “for.”
It’s an important consideration. In elections, there is an old saw that holds people would rather vote for the devil they know over the devil they don’t because things could always be worse. Everyone knows by now – unless they have been living under a rock for the last six years – what the GOP is against. The party and its political leaders have been less successful cutting through the continuous cacophony of background noise generated by the president and his fellow Democrats in their effort to explain to voters outside the party’s natural base just what it stands for today – without a Ronald Reagan, a Jack Kemp or a Newt Gingrich at the helm, articulating a clear vision for moving the country forward.
