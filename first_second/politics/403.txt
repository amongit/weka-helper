NEW DELHI: When anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare's fast demanding the constitution of Lok Pal shook the nation in April 2011, the movement was supposed to be an apolitical one in nature. Hazare and the core members of the team repeatedly assured the followers that they will not convert it into a political movement or join any political party to achieve desired goals. The apolitical nature of the mass movement had attracted a large following across India within a short span of time.
The political class which was literally shaken by the impact and growing popularity of the team Anna, challenged them to join the politics and change the system through electoral process, not through street protests. But, it was ridiculed and rejected by team Anna. For over a year, the India Against Corruption (IAC) remained an apolitical movement committed to eradicate corruption from India and hold political class responsible for the maladministration.
