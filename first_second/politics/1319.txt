The latest political scandal involving the White House made headlines around the country, dominated the questions fired at press secretary Josh Earnest at the daily news briefing and had the District’s finest journalists asking what President Barack Obama knew, when he knew it and why he’d chosen to embarrass America in the global fight against terrorism.
Finally, Earnest had to admit the truth: the White House made a mistake by not sending the president, Vice President Joe Biden nor any “higher-profile” administration official to join French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders for the big unity rally in Paris on Sunday. The lone representative: Jane Hartley, the U.S. ambassador to France, who was a bundler for Obama’s 2012 campaign.
