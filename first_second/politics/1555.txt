There he was, the first person I literally ran into on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Tampa: Tennessee State Senator Stacey Campfield, the man who authored his state's notorious "don't say gay" bill, which, if passed, would ban any discussion of homosexuality in state schools because, according to Campfield, homosexuality is "dangerous."
"You made me famous," he quipped, referring to comments he made in an interview I conducted with him that caused a national uproar when he claimed it is "virtually impossible to contract AIDS through heterosexual sex. " (Among other things, he'd also idiotically claimed that HIV migrated from monkeys to humans because of "one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. It was an airline pilot, if I recall.")
