U.S. workers have yet to see the benefits of slowing rates in health care costs. In fact, a new report shows their wallets have continued to be hit increasingly hard during the last decade when it comes to premiums and deductibles.
The report, from the research group the Commonwealth Fund, looks at trends in premium and deductible growth state-by-state during a 10-year period. It finds that health insurance costs grew faster than income in every state, with Southern states facing the highest cost burdens because of low median incomes. Average total premiums equaled 22 percent or more of median income in 12 Southern states. In 15 states, employeesâ€™ annual payment for their share of premiums rose by 100 percent or more.
