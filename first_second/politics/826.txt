Bad news for Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, the two potential "dynasty" candidates in the 2016 presidential campaign: Most Americans want change in the next White House, and they don't believe either Bush or Clinton would provide it.
Fifty-nine percent of voters prefer a "change" candidate to an experienced and tested one, up from 55 percent in July 2008 when Barack Obama was on his way to winning the White House with a promise of "hope and change," according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.
