New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav claimed on Monday that his party will rewrite history once again.
Soon after the Election Commission declared the election schedule for the Delhi Assembly elections, Yadav said it would be a straight battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP. "AAP will rewrite history once again," he said.
