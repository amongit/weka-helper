Opponents of the Affordable Care Act who criticize it as socialist or liberal either don't have a meaningful understanding of those terms or of the law, or both.
Beyond vague platitudes about Obamacare being a massive government takeover of health care (it isn't) or an oppressive tax (it's not that either), there is an absence of cogent, specific reasons why expanding access to health care and enacting basic patient protections from onerous insurance practices amounts to bad policy, let alone how private market-driven health care amounts to socialism and Obamacare is liberal.
