New Delhi: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said it was he who had asked former Environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan to save the environment and the Adivasis and that he was not scared of this fact.
Addressing an election rally in Delhi, Rahul said, "I have always fought for the underprivileged and I will continue to do so fearlessly. Congress is a party of the poor and the weaker sections of the society. I am in politics today only for the cause of the poor."
