Confession -- I didn't vote; I couldn't vote. But I wanted to.
Like so many others around the world, I've spent my (young) adult life obsessing over American politics. I grew up watching the West Wing and imagined myself working in President Bartlet's White House. I spent my undergraduate degree studying history, taking as many American history courses as I could.
