Washington (CNN)Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei joined top U.S. officials Thursday in blasting a letter 47 GOP senators recently sent on the Iran nuclear talks.
Khamenei dismissed the letter as "part of their ploys and tricks," according to Iran's official state outlet, Press TV. The senators, who are highly critical of the deal being worked out, wrote the Islamic Republic to warn its leaders of Congress's role in approving and implementing any agreement.
