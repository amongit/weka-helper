Number of Clint Eastwood "empty chair speech" views on YouTube: 273,256. Number of law enforcement officers on the street during RNC: 3,500. Number of arrests: two. Number of months taken to plan for RNC at UT? Eighteen months.
That is how long it took a small group of administrators at UT to come up with a plan to keep 6000 students safe during what was described to us by Homeland Security as one of four national security events this year in the U.S. We reviewed video from past conventions and spoke to administrators from other institutions that had similar events close to their campus. We met with lawyers, city officials and received briefings from every law enforcement agency known to man. We listened, talked, yelled, agreed, disagreed, emailed, joked, rolled our eyes and mostly ate a lot of fattening food at our 8:30 am meetings. Yes, egg biscuits and yogurt parfaits were all that was needed to entice this group, pretty sad.
