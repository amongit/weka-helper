As he usually does, President Obama gave a good speech. He hit many of the right notes, whether praising the son of a barkeep turned House speaker or the bravery of an Army Ranger Cory Remsburg. He mentioned a string of laudable policy proposals from re-extending unemployment insurance to pay equity to a solid defense of his landmark health care law and so forth.
Any speech, however, is constrained by its circumstances. It's a common misconception of presidents in general and the bully pulpit in particular that they can, through sheer force of will, alter the course of events, but it's rarely so for presidents and it's never so for speeches. A speech can catalyze a moment and shape the current of events, but a speech alone cannot redirect them. The greatest speeches rise to the full potential context allows â€“ they, and those delivering them, seize their moment.
