"Americans don't want angry, defensive figures running for president," Democratic operative Will Marshall told McClatchy's David Lightman this week. But who, precisely, is angry and defensive? As the pushback to Wall Street's influence on government grows stronger, it is the banking industry's supporters who sound enraged. And as economic populism gains traction in Democratic circles, it is corporate Democrats like Marshall who find themselves increasingly on the defensive.
Marshall and his organization (the misleadingly named "Progressive Policy Institute") are part of a corporate-financed movement which has tacked the Democratic Party sharply rightward in recent decades. Marshall was a member of the "Committee for the Liberation of Iraq," which pushed hard for the invasion of that country in 2002, and signed a letter from the Project for a New American Century promoting that cause. On the domestic front, Marshall's organization can be counted on to support such moves as last week's deregulatory gift to Wall Street (see here for more).
