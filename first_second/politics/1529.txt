I was there. It was 9 a.m. as I stood in the far end of a crowd of thousands in the National Mall. I relied on the big screens to entertain me, for I had no official ticket, no special pass, and no connection to the front of the pandemonium. It was the 52nd Presidential Inauguration in Washington, D.C. on the same day as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. I was more than ever awaiting to see the man that everyone knew as Barack Obama get not only reaffirmed as our 44th President of the United States, but also earn a well-deserved second chance.
For the first time in my life, I witnessed a different kind of history. One that was not as pronounced as the first time President Barack Obama took the oath of office, but something even grander. Here was an individual who spent the last four years of his term being questioned about his citizenship, leadership and experience. Politicians on both ends of the aisle doubted his credibility and began to become skeptics of his efficiency.
