LOS ANGELES – The New World still lives and breathes in this motley city of story and dream factories. This is where I grew up, but I always see it anew; it never stays the same. That’s the pilgrim soul – or shall we say, the immigrant soul? Even here in the heart of the Brentwood Country Mart, time and place may vary, but we all go back to the boat.
This week of Thanksgiving, that seems apt. President Barack Obama’s adept timing in issuing a broad order on immigration was a master stroke after a long dry spell. We are a nation of immigrants, after all.
