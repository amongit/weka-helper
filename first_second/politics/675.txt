When the new 114th Congress is sworn in tomorrow, Republicans will control both the House and the Senate for the first time since 2006. In many ways, Congress doesn't look like the rest of the United States: Members are richer, more educated, more white and more likely to be men. This round of senators and representatives is no different. One underrepresented group, however, is often overlooked: the religiously unaffiliated.
Although Congress resembles the U.S. population for the most part in terms of religious populations, declaring a religion seems to be one thing required of politicians seeking office. Only one member, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., identifies as religiously unaffiliated.
