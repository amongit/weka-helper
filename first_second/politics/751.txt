Confederate General Robert E. Lee, a fine individual on the wrong side of history, is surfacing again, 149 years after “The Surrender.” Since the Civil War, his legend has been burnished by admiring authors and statesmen, portraying him as a noble courtly character. To this day, new biographies treat him as if he’s a tenderly flawed hero.
A plan is afoot to fix up his mansion at Arlington and restore its antebellum splendor. It sits on a plum piece of land in Virginia, by the beautiful blue Potomac River overlooking the city of Washington. You may know the place as Arlington national cemetery.
