Freshman Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) made waves Monday after authoring a letter to the Iranian leadership offering some not so friendly advice about the prospects of a potential nuclear agreement with the United States. The letter, signed by 46 other Republican senators, suggested that any agreement that could be reached would be unlikely to last beyond the end of President Obama's term, and could be undone with "the stroke of a pen." Senator Cotton may be inclined to refer to the letter as a reasonable use of Congressional authority to involve itself in foreign affairs, but critics were quick to call it what it really is: another move in a clearly partisan strategy to undermine the president's authority to negotiate with foreign leaders.
Unfortunately, Senator Cotton isn't wrong in arguing that a precedent exists by which Congress interjects in foreign affairs against the better wishes of the White House. Less than a decade ago, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) traveled to Syria to meet with President Bashar al-Asad despite attempts by the Bush administration to isolate the regime. And to the credit of Senate Republicans, Democrats are being hypocritical by condemning the letter when they were quick to defend Pelosi's trip to Syria. Questions of whether they violated the Logan Act are equally misguided.
