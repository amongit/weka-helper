With this summer came many complex and, for many, confusing international events. Especially when most Americans have no personal connection to most parts of the globe we witness on the news, it can be difficult to maintain personal compassion and understanding for the nuance of each situation. It's much easier to understand when you hear from individuals in the first person. Of course, it's still important to recognize that people's backgrounds and childhood experiences inform their unique perspectives.
Yet, college is an exceptional opportunity to make personal the affairs of the world. Approximately three-quarters of a million international students study at universities in the United States. At my school, Princeton, about 10 percent of the students hail from about 100 countries around the world. So since I've returned to Princeton in September, I've compiled a list of what five international students, whose families still live in these countries, want you to know about what happened in their countries this summer. This list is neither complete nor exhaustive, but it's important. If you meet someone from Syria, or from the Ukraine, I would urge you to take the time to put down the news and hear his or her story.
