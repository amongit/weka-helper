In the winter of 1974, Seymour Hersh, arguably America's greatest investigative reporter, pieced together a story he had been working on for years, developing contacts both in and out of the country's spy agencies. Using a variety of anonymous sources, including perhaps the director of the CIA, Hersh uncovered a bombshell.
The American Central Intelligence Agency, in direct violation of law, had compiled dossiers on thousands of Americans, opening their mail and tapping their phones. The NSA spying that we have learned about recently, in fact, should hardly be a surprise.
