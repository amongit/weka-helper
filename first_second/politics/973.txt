There’s a lot at stake for both parties in Tuesday’s election. The president is not on the ballot but, in an effort to turn out his supporters, he has said his policies are. A good night for the GOP in the battle for control of Congress could therefore be seen as an expression of the electorate’s desire for change in Washington.
The country’s patience with President Barack Obama is growing thin. He has failed to deliver on most of his campaign promises and now leads a nation that is more sharply divided along partisan lines than it has been for many years. So much for the “post partisan” era the pundits said his election augured.
