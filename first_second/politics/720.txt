As people marked the 26th annual World AIDS Day with awareness campaigns and red ribbons on Monday, groups like UNAIDS, who are working for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, say they plan to have the epidemic eradicated by 2030. Though recent data indicate they gradually are moving toward their goal, at this time HIV/AIDS is still the No. 1 cause of death by infection worldwide.
Since the first cases were reported in the U.S. in 1981, 39 million people have died from the virus, including 1.5 million globally last year alone.
