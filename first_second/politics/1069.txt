All you need to know to understand how the politics of the debt ceiling have changed is what House Speaker John Boehner asked his conference yesterday after announcing that he was raising the white flag and passing a clean debt limit increase: “You’re not even going to clap for me for getting this monkey off our backs?”
That’s what the debt ceiling fights had become for Republicans: a problem they couldn’t get rid of. Why? They became victims of their own success and of what is arguably the monkey’s crazy uncle – the party’s unrealistic activist base. Their success came in 2011 when the party threatened to not raise the limit and extracted $2 trillion in spending cuts from President Obama.
