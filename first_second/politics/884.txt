Black and white Americans have starkly different opinions on how President Obama is handling race relations, according to the latest poll by the Pew Research Center and USA Today.
The survey finds that only 40 percent of Americans approve of Obama's handling of race relations and 50 percent disapprove. This is a marked deterioration in his standing on the issue from four months ago, when a controversial police shooting occurred in Ferguson, Missouri. In August, 48 per cent approved of Obama's handling of race relations and 42 percent disapproved.
