With Labor Day having come and gone, the 2014 fall campaign is about to be in full swing. And to kick it off, the bulk of the reporters and analysts who cover U.S. elections are busy writing stories designed to tamp down expectations that the GOP is going to win big in November.
Their evidence is that none of the hotly-contested Senate races where Republican challengers are nipping at the heels of the Democrats they are running against has broken wide open. North Carolina? Too close to call. Arkansas? Too close to call. Louisiana? Too close to call. And so on and so on. If there was a wave coming, the pundits argue, these races would already have been put away.
