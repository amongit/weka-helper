Washington (CNN)The GOP is so committed to thwarting President Barack Obama's deal-making with Iran that it resorted to a tactic it has long condemned him for using -- writing a letter to Tehran.
In an unusual and controversial challenge to presidential authority that ignited a fierce new row with the White House, 47 Republican senators warned the Iranian government Monday that any deal it reaches with Obama might not be worth the paper it's written on once he leaves office in less than two years.
