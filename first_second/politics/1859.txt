WASHINGTON -- Independent candidate Greg Orman tried as hard as he could to deflect any suggestion that he was a Democratic Party stalking horse in his ultimately failed bid to defeat Republican incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas.
Orman, who faced Roberts one-on-one after the Democratic candidate dropped out, repeatedly stated that he would caucus with whichever party won the majority in the Senate and might even switch sides later on. But Democrats seemed to think he would ultimately be a vote for their side, and they put their money on him.
