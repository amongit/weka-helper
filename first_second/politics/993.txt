Conservatives, especially those “inside the Beltway,” are starting to get a little nervous. They watch the polls like ordinary Americans follow the box scores in baseball – and they don’t like what they see. To them, the data says the Democrats are still in a position to control the U.S. Senate after the November elections.
What they forget, however, is that data is a tool, something to be used in analysis that is not in and of itself determinant of outcomes. Unless, after studying it, people act in such a way as to make the data a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.
