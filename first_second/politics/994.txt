We’ve reached a point in civil society when it is not always possible to know when one might be committing a crime. In his book "Three Felonies A Day – How the Feds Target the Innocent," attorney Harvey Silverglate argues the federal government has, by statute and through regulation, made lawbreakers out of us all.
This is even true among the political class – both elected officials and appointees – at the national, state and local levels. Though not exactly popular right now, those in office are forced to walk a tightrope between what is legal and what is not because the law has become so convoluted. We’re not always sympathetic to their plight, though we should be because, as Silverglate writes in the introduction, “While it’s true politicians under indictment aren’t likely to garner much public sympathy, a healthy skepticism is due when federal authority is imposed on matters primarily of state and local concern. Nothing short of the proper functioning of democratic governance is at stake.”
