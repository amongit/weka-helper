WASHINGTON -- During his tenure behind the podium, the issue that vexed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney the most was the debacle of HealthCare.gov, he said.
Speaking Thursday morning to reporters assembled at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast series, Carney called the problematic launch of the president’s signature legislative initiative “the most difficult period since I’ve been a press secretary.” He was discussing tactical challenges as opposed to policy setbacks. On policy setbacks, what hurt the most was the failure to respond to the Newtown shooting, he has said.
