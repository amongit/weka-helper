WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that Republicans can go after his immigration programs in the courts and in Congress, but his confidence will not be shaken.
"In the short term, if Mr. McConnell, the leader of the Senate, and the speaker of the House, John Boehner, want to have a vote over whether what I’m doing is legal or not, they can have that vote," Obama said at a town hall in Miami hosted by MSNBC and Telemundo's José Díaz-Balart. "I will veto that vote because I’m absolutely confident it’s the right thing to do."
