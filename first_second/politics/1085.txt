SYDNEY â€“ Ted Cruz, the tea party senator who would be president, might have only risen to national prominence in the last few months, but his reputation for "ugly American"-style pomposity has been preceding him here for nearly 20 years.
I'm down here for the Public Knowledge Forum conference on the future of the media and had the pleasure of dining over the weekend with a number of local politicos including Tony Burke, a prominent member of the Australian parliament. He recalled how he had attended the 1995 World Universities Debating Championship, held that year in the U.S. at Princeton University in New Jersey.
