The amount of money states spend on each student for instruction and instruction-related services decreased nearly 3 percent nationwide between the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years, new data from the Department of Education show. And in many states with larger student populations, per-student spending was below the national average.
Nationwide, states spent an average of $10,667 per student in the 2011-12 school year – a 2.8 percent drop from the $10,975 they spent in 2010-11, according to a report from the National Center for Education Statistics released Thursday. In some states – such as Florida, Texas and Wisconsin – the decrease was more than 8 percent. Just seven states (Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, New Jersey, North Dakota and Vermont) increased per-student spending. The increases ranged from 0.2 percent in North Dakota to 10 percent in Vermont.
