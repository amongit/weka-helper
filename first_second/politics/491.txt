In the silence following Dick Cheney's last grumbled words in response to President Obama's speech on counterterrorism strategy last week, I could almost hear the clicking of thousands of keyboards as they erupted in a cacophony of punditry. Some masterfully dissected Cheney's statements to reveal their mind-blowing inanity, while others claimed Obama is hewing closely to the Bush Administration's approach to the threat from al-Qaeda (AQ) or criticized him for not going far enough on the treatment of detainees. I was tempted to ignore the speech, consigning Cheney to the irrelevancy he deserves, but I worry that many of the responses miss an important aspect of the two speeches, and overlook why Cheney's statements are so significant. Beyond the contrasting styles and rhetorical quality of President Obama and Cheney, what we really saw were two distinct views on the threats the United States faces.
The worldview Cheney presented was distressingly familiar. America faces a shadowy enemy that hates us for who we are; no policies we enact can change this. This enemy seems ever-present, from supposed sleeper cells throughout America to the next 9/11 waiting in the wings. Despite Cheney's refusal to provide details, though, the reality of this threat is apparently undeniable. Any lack of will among the American public -- which includes debating our counterterrorism strategies -- is capitulation to the terrorists. Moreover, the failure to completely appreciate the immediate and existential nature of this threat, which justifies seemingly immoral actions in response, would invite disaster. As Cheney said, there is "no middle ground;" we must either accept that terrorism poses a threat and support the use of torture and ill-advised wars of choice, or side with the terrorists.
