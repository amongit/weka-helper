The eyes of the world remain focused on Paris, where terrorist activities have cast a long and dark shadow over life in the City of Light.
It is reassuring that world leaders could come together as they did over the weekend to join arms in solidarity against the human monsters behind the senseless attacks that left far too many dead. They came not just to promote peace but to stand resilient in the name of liberty. And it is most unfortunate that U.S. President Barack Obama could not find the time to join them.
