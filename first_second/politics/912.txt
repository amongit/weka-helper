With the midterm election two weeks away, President Obama has handed Republicans another weapon to use against Democratic candidates for the Senate.
Obama told the Rev. Al Sharpton Monday in a radio interview that he doesn't take it personally when Democratic candidates don't want to campaign with him despite their shared party affiliation. "The bottom line is, though, these are all folks who vote with me," Obama said. "They have supported my agenda in Congress."
