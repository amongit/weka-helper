Perhaps the biggest front in the fight to define the fall of Eric Cantor has been the question of immigration. Was it a determinative factor in his stunning loss? Both those who favor comprehensive immigration reform and the opponents who deride it as amnesty have been furiously trying to shape the conventional wisdom to bolster their view. The stakes are big: If the mere fact of mildly flirting with immigration reform could sink the sitting majority leader, who could be safe? “Be afraid,” Slate’s John Dickerson warned Republican incumbents, for example
So the pro-reform forces are pushing back. Americans for a Conservative Direction, a pro-reform group headlined by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour among others, commissioned a poll of voters in Cantor’s district (or do we now start referring to it as David Brat’s district?) in the wake of Tuesday’s upset and released it today. (Pause for a moment and consider how much of a threat the pro-reform forces see the Cantor loss if they felt compelled to commission a poll to try to keep conventional wisdom from settling on an “immigration-killed-Cantor” narrative.)
