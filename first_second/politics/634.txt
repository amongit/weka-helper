A new state-level analysis shows American students are losing nearly 18 million days of instruction due to out-of-school suspensions. The study comes as education advocacy groups are increasingly critical of the ways schools discipline students, saying zero-tolerance policies disproportionately affect students of color, low-income students and those with disabilities.
The analysis, released Monday by UCLA's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, shows suspension rates are three to four times higher at the secondary level than at the elementary level, and that the racial gap in suspension rates also increased between elementary and secondary schools. Florida had the highest suspension rates at both the elementary and secondary levels, with 5.1 percent of elementary school students and 19 percent of secondary school students being suspended in the 2011-12 school year. In total, nearly 3.5 million students were suspended at least once during that school year.
