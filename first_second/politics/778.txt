You hear a lot about President Woodrow Wilson lately, but not about Alice Paul, the striking suffragette who took to the streets against him for years. She was a thoroughly modern 20th century young woman and a birthright Quaker. Wilson was born in the heart of Virginia five years before the Civil War began, a son of the South from a family of Presbyterian ministers. Need I say more? He was no match for her.
Woodrow Wilson is on the tip of Washington's tongue this holiday season because it's the centennial of his eight-year presidency. It began with his swearing-in on March 4, 1913. He was one of the last presidents to write his own speeches, and they were lofty. Like President Obama, many of his stands were progressive, but his record on civil liberties is troubling. In the end, he was a somewhat tragic visionary of world peace, but he is now being revisited and embraced with warm tributes and feelings. Woodrow, we hardly knew you under the proud Princeton professorial front. Woody Guthrie, the great folksinger, was actually named after him, so there's a dash of the common man in Wilson's legacy.
