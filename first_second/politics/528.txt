Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) continued to position himself to the left of Hillary Clinton on financial regulation this weekend and called for the reinstatement of a key piece of regulatory legislation that was repealed under President Bill Clinton.
O'Malley, who is considering a 2016 White House bid, told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday that he favored reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that required banks to keep their commercial and investment activities separate. The law was repealed with President Clinton's backing in 1999, which allowed banks to make risky bets with depositor money.
