While President Obama has apparently been busy correcting for his slice, the terrorist group Hamas has been shooting rockets at Israel. It’s a disturbing contrast: America’s closest ally in the Middle East is under constant attack from those sworn to obliterate it, as the leader of the world’s most powerful country plays golf. And unlike Israel’s leadership, Obama seems unwilling to take the necessary steps to ensure that the United States and its citizens are protected from similar attacks around the world.
This is a curious time in world events. Right now, rebels backed by Syria are attempting the overthrow of the U.S.-backed government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in Iraq at the same time that Syrian rebels are attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of President Bashar Assad. Iran is in the midst of negotiations with the Western powers over its nuclear program to lift costly sanctions supposedly in return for stopping production of enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons. But the Iranians are still resisting a full halt to their enrichment program.
