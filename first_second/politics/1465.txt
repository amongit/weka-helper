While almost every American could probably tell you some of the most prominent details of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as his time living in a log cabin or the opening of the Gettysburg Address, there is still much most people don't know about the country's 16th president.
With his 206th birthday almost upon us (Feb. 12), take some time to familiarize yourself a bit more with the American leader whose actions helped save the Union so "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, [did] not perish from the earth."
