One of the stronger talking points that would-be debt ceiling hostage takers have is on the question of whether presidents have negotiated over the debt ceiling. As I wrote last October, the wannabe economic terrorists do superficially have history on their side. To wit, presidents have negotiated these increases in the past, but they were low-stakes negotiations. Congress, in some cases in a bipartisan fashion, made demands that werenâ€™t worth fighting over.
