Two things struck me this morning as I was perusing Mike Allen’s daily Politico tipsheet, “Playbook.” The first had to do with the GOP’s full-on desertion of its attempts to woo Hispanic voters; the second was a small striking reminder of the latter's growing power.
Anyone who paid attention to the last presidential election will remember that President Barack Obama won an overwhelming portion of Hispanic voters – more than 7 in 10 – in his relatively comfortable re-election. As a result, the GOP's post-mortem report concluded, in part, that “among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, must be to embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,” and that “if we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”
