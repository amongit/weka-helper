Nigeria's practice of transactional democracy is delaying its progress and development due to the large numbers of ill-informed voters who give away their voting and bargaining power in exchange for minuscule items, such as food and cash.
American journalist George Will writes, "Politics in a democracy is transactional: politicians seek votes by promising to do things for voters, who seek promises in exchange for their votes." The issue beforehand is not whether or not Nigeria's democracy is transactional, but to ask what it will take to build more informed voters and civil society groups, audacious enough to follow through on holding leaders at all levels accountable for Nigeria's progress and development.
