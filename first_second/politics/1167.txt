New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's unrestrained celebration of the Dallas Cowboys' playoff victory Sunday matters in the spectrum of 2016 politics â€“ but perhaps not for the reasons you think.
Despite governing a state that roots for two of the Cowboys bitter rivals, Christie's unabashed love for "America's Team" is likely to be excused by the level-headed observer. If it was just rooting for the Cowboys, it could be laughed off, dismissed as a petty offense in the grander scheme of politics.
