Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been called many things, among them a reformer, visionary, catalyst for a new Indian era, and even a saint. He has been featured on the covers of numerous American magazines, closely followed by the global media and satirized by the likes of Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart. Who can blame the following that Modi has acquired after India's historic elections, in which his Bharatiya Janata Party won 282 of the 543 seats in the election, enough to form a government without brokering a coalition and shutting out the mostly ruling party since India's independence with a mere 44 seats. The magnitude of these results, now a foregone conclusion, has given Modi a widespread and populist mandate to change India's political structure and the manner in which it is governed.
If this past Indian general election was any indication, with its more than 553 million voters or 66 percent voter turnout rate, it was that excitement over Modi's candidacy brought a wave of new and otherwise passive voters to the poll, in addition to established voters. A post-poll survey by Lokniti shows that voters over the age of 56 supported BJP 31 percent to 23 percent for Congress. But more remarkably, newly registered young voters, ages 18 to 22, supported Modi's party by 20 percentage points over the establishment party.
