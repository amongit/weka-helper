In today’s politics edition of “That’s Incredible!” we learn Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican contemplating a presidential run, has never used email. Not even once:
Graham was reacting to the Hillary Clinton mess, in which the former secretary of state and future (maybe) Democratic presidential candidate used private email accounts to conduct public business. His claim to never have used this now-standard, decades-old form of electronic communication is remarkable – like hearing someone say they’ve never used a laptop computer, or a cellphone, or an ATM machine, or one of those newfangled horseless carriages everyone’s been talking about. It’s also nearly impossible to independently verify.
