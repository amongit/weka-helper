(CNN)If you haven't been living under a rock for the past two weeks, you probably know that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a private email account during her time as secretary, and that -- at the request of the State Department -- she submitted 55,000 pages of emails from that account for proper archiving.
You probably also saw that Clinton asked the State Department to release her emails to the public, and they have agreed to do so "as soon as possible."
