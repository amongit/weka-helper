Recently, Vision 2020 convened a group of women leaders in Pennsylvania to compile a list of names of highly qualified, accomplished women to submit to the transition team of Governor-Elect Tom Wolf. The purpose of this effort was to help achieve gender balance in cabinet appointments and senior staff in the new administration.
The result of the meeting was the submission of 60 names of talented women from across the Commonwealth with a letter signed by 16 recognized Pennsylvania leaders.
