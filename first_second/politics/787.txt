The speaker is Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic Leader. The place is the Senate floor. The time is last week, after the House Republicans committed the latest outrage, voting to cut the food stamp program, always part of the farm bill â€“ until now. Hear Harry speak on one of life's simple pleasures:
One of my favorite things that I really like to do in Nevada and here, in Washington, is go grocery shopping. It's such a diversion for me. I love going grocery shopping to look around, buy the things. Landra and I are without our children and our grandchildren. We live alone. But we still buy food. And I enjoy that so very, very much.
