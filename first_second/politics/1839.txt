When it comes to predicting elections, pollsters are often judged on whether their results seem to consistently favor one party over another. The industry shorthand for this is "house effects."
Poll critics are quick to argue that the existence of house effects proves deliberate partisanship and to suggest that many election surveys are deliberately skewed. But partisanship is not the only reason that a pollster's work may repeatedly favor one partyâ€™s candidates.
