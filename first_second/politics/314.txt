This week marked the 50-year anniversary of "Bloody Sunday," the day hundreds of demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, were brutally beaten and arrested by state troopers as they attempted to march to Montgomery in a protest against racial discrimination in voter registration. Fifty years later, voting rights remain a hotly contested issueâ€”especially where voter-identification laws are concerned.
Thirty-one states, mostly in the South, currently require voters to present identification on Election Day. These states maintain that this practice is important to prevent voter fraud, although research shows that fraud at the ballot box is rare. Others argue that requiring identification discriminates against those who can't afford the often-high costs of obtaining identification.
