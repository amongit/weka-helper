The fourth and final debate of the 2012 presidential race was held along the East Coast on October 29th with Hurricane Sandy as the moderator. Until then, global warming and its economic, social and political repercussions were conspicuously absent from the debates, with neither candidates nor moderators, broaching the subject, as reported in the New York Times.
Was Sandy a tipping point for the global warming debate? Will politicians continue to mock climate change as Mitt Romney did at the Republican Convention when he elicited laughter by saying; "President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise ... is to help you and your family." According to Jennifer Daniel in Businessweek, "the number of natural disasters since 1996 costing $1 billion or more doubled compared with the previous 15 year period." "It's Global Warming, Stupid" was the headline in this same issue of Businessweek. Healing the planet and helping our families are not mutually exclusive.
