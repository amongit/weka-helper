I often joke that Mexico is just a stone throw away from me or is my backyard, and sometimes that is not an exaggeration. It is so close to me in San Diego that we breathe the same air and share the same sky, but are still considered to live in entirely different worlds. If you have ever made the journey of going across the border from San Diego into Tijuana, you can vouch that there truly is a difference that is starkly noticeable.
But every day when I walk out the door of my house and look in the distance, I can see the frontera, the U.S.-Mexican border. At night when I am driving home, and the lights across the border are shining bright like a constellation of stars - it takes my breath away. There is no denying that there is a beauty to my backyard.
