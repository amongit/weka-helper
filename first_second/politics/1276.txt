Four Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon):
Clear as Mud: President Barack Obama released his latest National Security Strategy report Friday, and it was about as direct and linear as you’d expect from an administration variously described as “paralyzed,” “vague” and “not very good.” U.S. News’ Paul D. Shinkman reports that the document is more political than strategic, befitting a complex world which contains both Islamic State group suicide-bomb barbarism and old-school tanks-and-infantry Russian military. But what the document lacks in bold clarity – there’s not much beyond bromides about closing Gitmo, rebuilding overseas alliances but acting unilaterally, if necessary, against threats to the homeland (see also: drone strikes) – it makes up for in a certain “let’s not start wars we can’t finish” quality.
