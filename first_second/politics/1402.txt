President Obama announced some radically redistributive measures during the State of the Union on Tuesday. The Robin-Hood-esque plan proposes raising the taxes and cutting tax breaks on the super-rich and easing the burden on poorer Americans. Needless to say, members of the GOP are not pleased and haven't been since the plan was announced last Saturday night.
Republicans, as a rule, hate tax increases, especially when they have an adverse effect on the very rich and corporations - such as making them slightly less rich. They also apparently hate tax cuts, especially when it would improve the lives of working families and the poor.
