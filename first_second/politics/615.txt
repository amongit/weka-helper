Reese Erlich is a foreign correspondent with GlobalPost and reports regularly for National Public Radio (NPR), the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC), and Radio Deutsche Welle. His reporting has earned him multiple awards over the years. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors declared September 14, 2010, "Reese Erlich Day" in honor of his investigative work. "Mr. Erlich," the resolution read, "exhibits the finest qualities of...reporters willing to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable."
He is also a friend of mine. We met in the home of our mutual friend Stephen Kinzer. Kinzer wrote the Foreword to Erlich's book Dateline Havana: The Real Story of US Policy and the Future of Cuba and when Erich was in Chicago in early 2009 to discuss the book, Kinzer hosted a gathering for him in his home in Oak Park. It was a fabulous evening, and Erlich and I stayed in touch. A few months later he was in Iran, reporting on the historic protests that convulsed the Islamic Republic following its June presidential election. He wrote some of the very smartest stuff about those dramatic events. Erlich is a dyed-in-the-wool New Leftist who cut his teeth at Ramparts, the iconic magazine of1960s radicalism, but he took many of his fellow leftists to task for the utter myopia they displayed amidst the events in Iran that summer. His essay "Iran and Leftist Confusion" was bang-on and desperately-needed. He also provided a healthy corrective to the pervasive narcissistic blather about Iran's Green movement being a Twitter revolution.
