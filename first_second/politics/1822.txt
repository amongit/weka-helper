You've heard the arguments: If Democrats want to turn their 2014 losses into 2016 wins, they need to get their base voting next time, they need to stay on message, they need to support their president, etc. The list is endless. After all, as the pundits say, it was the Democrats' loss, not a Republican win. Maybe that is so, but not for the reasons most commonly listed. As any successful sports team knows, it's not only about the A team, but also the B team -- especially when it comes to women in elected office.
It's about the backbench.
