On March 5, 2015, the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, William F. "Bill" Browder made a speech at the Oxford Union describing his personal experiences investing in Russia, the death of Sergei Magnitsky and the kleptocratic nature of Putin's regime. Browder was the largest foreign investor in Russia until 2005, when he became blacklisted from Russia as a "threat to national security." He has since emerged as one of Putin's most strident critics, and a prominent human rights activist, after the death of Hermitage's lawyer and auditor Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. Following his speech at the Oxford Union, Browder agreed to sit down for an interview with me. The transcript is below:
You contributed to a book called "Why Europe Needs a Magnitsky Law: Should the EU follow the US?" Have you tried to incentivize other countries to adopt legislation on Russian human rights similar to the 2010 Magnitsky Law in the US? How successful have your efforts been?
