The roulette wheel that is presidential politics is spinning faster now that we are only one year and eight months from election day. Bets are being placed as the main stakeholders look to their future financial and career investments. The media play to the hilt this longest running spectacle that our pop culture offers.

Thus the world's greatest democracy and sole superpower approaches its Quadrennial moment of decision in selecting who its next ruler will be.
