After the GOP's resounding electoral defeat in the 2012 presidential election, which blindsided elite Republican strategists, there was an outcry from media pundits, party leaders, and bloggers. The Republican Party had to reinvent itself. In the February 17, 2013 issue of the New York Times Magazine, "The Late Adopters" by Robert Draper asks if young Republican strategists can change the minds of old guard Republican leaders. The subtitle says it all: Can young Republican dissidents rise up and drag the party into the 21st century?
If the Republicans want to be known as the party of job creators, as the Bush administration called the wealthiest Americans, it can begin to walk the party's talk and possibly win back some of the voters who consider the current version of the GOP too extreme. In 2011, there were over 27 million small businesses in the United States, and over 60 percent of all new jobs are created from this sector. Even taking into account the malleable meaning of "small business" this is a significant number. Additional cuts in corporate tax rates have been increasingly ineffective, and have only served to help corporations hold local governments and communities hostage to unreasonable demands.
