Mitt Romney made some surprising and relatively unpublicized comments on campaign finance reform during a Fox News interview just before the Republican convention. His remarks relate to Public Citizen's WhiteHouseForSale project, which tracks the candidates' major fundraisers, or bundlers. The list of Romney bundlers is, of course, a short one because Romney has only revealed the sliver of them required by law.
Fox's Chris Wallace asked Romney if his wife's comments that he, if elected, would seek to get the huge money out of politics and would consider participating in the public funding system next time around were true. "Oh, absolutely," Romney responded. "I would far rather have a setting where we had both agreed to the federal spending limits."
