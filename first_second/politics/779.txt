Under the luster, the shining smile, quick wit, sonorous speech and athletic figure, the president was a loner. In one of those history rhymes, a close look at John Fitzgerald Kennedy's journey to the White House holds up a light to his alter-ego, Barack Obama.
All of the above traits: That's a conclusion the "High Court of History" has reached about John Fitzgerald Kennedy â€“ Jack to most. A keen reader and Pulitzer-Prize winning writer of history himself, Kennedy would likely accept that verdict. Ironic, cerebral and restless, always with his eye on the next thing. He thought constantly of the past and the future, perhaps knowing his time would be short. He had plenty of friends, more than he could count, who were crazy about him and eager to help him onto the next thing, whether it be the Senate or the White House. Besides which, family money and power was no object. But he was cool and that was part of his charm. Ditto for Obama, except lately his cool is wearing thin.
