(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) President Obama says he "is embarrassed for" the 47 Senate Republicans who this week sent a letter to Iranian leaders. "I'm embarrassed for them," the president says in a preview clip released Friday for an upcoming interview with Vice News. "For them to address a letter to the ayatollah ... who they claim is our mortal enemy, and their basic argument to them is, 'Don't deal with our president because you can't trust him to follow through on an agreement.' That's close to unprecedented." The letter, part of a broader effort to undercut the administration's nuclear negotiations with Iran, has received intense criticism. The full Vice News interview with the president will be released Monday: The Post's Sean Sullivan reported on the backlash Thursday: "Several Republican senators said Thursday that they didn't anticipate such an intense backlash to the open letter that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent to Iranian leaders on Monday. ... Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who also signed on, called the negative response "a significant overreaction" to "a number of senators expressing their view of something that's a fact, that Congress, the Senate, needs to be involved."
