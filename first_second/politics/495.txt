Over the last week, pundits and journalists alike have declared that the showdown between Obama and The Left has begun. As the FT's Edward Luce announces: "The liberal backlash against President Barack Obama has begun with many prominent left-leaning economists in the US attacking the administration's plans to bail out the banks." Indeed, Paul Krugman, Arriana Huffington, Joseph Stiglitz, Robert Reich, Rachel Maddow, and Michael Moore have indeed criticized last week's announcements on the new bank bailout and Afghanistan.
Yet, a crack up of the Democratic coalition or fracturing of the progressive movement it is not. And that's what counts.
