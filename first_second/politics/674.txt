As states slowly recover from the Great Recession, many are still struggling to replenish funds for higher education. In fact, nearly every state still spends less on higher education now than in 2007.
The Student Impact Project, an initiative of the youth advocacy group Young Invincibles, tracked trends in higher education finance in states across the country, and graded each state based on tuition levels, state funding per student, state aid to students, the financial burden to families and higher education spending as a portion of the total state budget. It did not grade states based on outcome or academic quality measures.
