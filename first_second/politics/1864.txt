After laughing off the prospect of another presidential run by Mitt Romney last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) had even more critical words for the former Massachusetts governor’s re-invention as an anti-poverty warrior.
“Doing it in such a ham-handed manner in what appears to be a deathbed conversion is a strange way to suddenly come out of the box with it, and I find it disingenuous, and I think a lot of other people will too,” de Blasio told Politico in an interview over the weekend. “This is a guy who was pretty brazenly uninterested in addressing income inequality in 2012.”
