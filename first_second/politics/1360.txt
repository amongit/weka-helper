Women's conferences have become the must have accessory of power women. Tina has one. Mika is launching hers. Hillary speaks at all of them. Corporations, such as Google, Comcast, and Astra Zeneca, have rushed to sponsor them seeing them as a relatively painless way to appear sensitive to gender diversity and other women's issues. When I first heard about them, I was excited about the infinite potential of thousands of women gathering. Gurl Power!
After my initial elation, I decided to dig deeper and check if anything substantive is being accomplished at these events. Or are women's conferences simply an excuse for a feel good work day away from the office?
