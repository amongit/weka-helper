At the high-water mark of the Victorian Age British Empire, Her Majesty's Poet Laureate Alfred Austin was asked to share his conception of Heaven. It was, Lord Austin declared, to sit in an English garden receiving alternating messengers bearing reports of British victories at sea and British victories on land.
The Pax Americana replaced Pax Britannia nearly 70 years ago, but it's been a very long time, if ever, since anything like Austin's conception applied in the American version. Certainly no one would think anything like that today.
