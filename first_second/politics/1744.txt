Little did I expect that on my first day as executive director of Interfaith Alliance, the most concise articulation of our mission would come from the President of the United States. Even less likely, that it would come during the State of the Union address. But there it was, in three sentences, an endorsement of our mission: It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.
It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims -- the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.
