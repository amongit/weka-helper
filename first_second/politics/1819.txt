Let's be honest: men are crappy leaders. For every inspirational Nelson Mandela there's a tyrannical Kim Jong-il and about a hundred lousy James Buchanans in the middle. Now, the average mediocrity of male leaders is probably more of a result of the mediocrity of humans and not just that of a specific sex, but without an equal amount of female leaders present today and throughout history, we cannot be quite certain if this stereotype is true. Similarly, we cannot be certain if the reverse stereotype is true: do women make horrible leaders as well?
