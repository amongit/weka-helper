WASHINGTON -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) complained Wednesday about the way presidential primary debates are structured and suggested they may not be fair to Republican candidates since some of the journalists serving as moderators -- namely, ABC's George Stephanopoulos -- may be secretly working with Democrats.
During an interview on Geraldo Rivera's radio show, Paul was asked if he agrees with an effort by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus to force two networks, CNN and NBC, to cancel planned TV projects on Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential race. Otherwise, Priebus has threatened, the Republican Party won't partner with those networks when it comes time to air the GOP primary debates. Paul and Clinton are both considered potential 2016 presidential contenders, though neither has announced plans.
