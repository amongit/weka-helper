From time to time I am asked to present my thoughts on the economy to various groups. I usually put a lengthy slide show together, which puts me in a race against time to finish within the allotted time. One of the main arguments that I have been trying to convey this year is that yes, the economy is improving at a moderate pace. Given the recent economic data, especially within the labor market, I think this is a fairly indisputable point. Jobs are being created at a pace of roughly 200K-250K per month, the unemployment rate is down sharply, consumer confidence has improved dramatically, household net worth is at record levels, interest rates are low, inflation is low, corporate profits are at records levels, and I could go on and on. I have also argued that there are significant problems still plaguing the economy (too much debt, income inequality, lack of wage growth), but let's put that aside for now.
The bigger points I have been trying to get across in my presentations are these: 1) It has taken an incredible amount of stimulus to achieve the moderate economic growth we are now enjoying; and 2) the removal or reversal of some of these stimulants will put a ceiling on the rate of economic growth we can expect over the next few years. As you read the following list, try to imagine the effects on economic growth if/when each trend begins to stabilize or even reverse:
