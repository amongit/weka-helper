President Barack Obama is serving notice that he will continue to bypass the mainstream news media as a fundamental strategy during his remaining tenure in the White House, and he is urging his successor to do the same.
The president told Vox, an alternative media outlet described by Obama as "for the brainiac-nerd types," that the next president will need to circumvent the mainstream media, as he has, in order to speak directly to different segments of the public that the traditional media, such as the broadcast television networks, cable TV and major newspapers, might be overlooking or not serving adequately.
