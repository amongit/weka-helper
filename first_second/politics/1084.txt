When the clock strikes midnight and we move from 2013 into 2014 the United States population will have reached a new record of more than 317 million people, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. That will keep us as the third most populous country on the planet, behind only China (1.35 billion) and India (1.23 billion). Overall, the world population will top 7.1 billion at the start of 2014.
The precise figure – 317,297,938 – will mark an increase of 2,218,622 people in the 365 days since 2012 passed into 2013. That’s a 0.7 percent increase, or roughly the same as 2012 and 2011 and a slightly higher rate than 2010 (0.6 percent), but lagging behind the relative baby boom of 2009 (when the population grew by 0.9 percent).
