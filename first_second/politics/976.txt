With the November election just days away – and a consensus building that the Republicans will come out of it in control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate – the question people are starting to ask is “What next?”
In fact, the election may turn out to be something of a national GOP landslide, with a few pundits predicting the Republicans will reach an historic number of seats in state legislatures across the country, leading to control of more chambers and states that at any time since the 1920s. With that kind of representation, the GOP becomes the national majority party and, after a fashion, reduces President Barack Obama to a sort of irrelevance, at least in terms of his ability to set the agenda for the nation.
