Being Mayor is about meeting people's challenges, solving problems and getting things done. Boston faced one of its biggest challenges this winter with the unprecedented snowfall that brought over eight feet of snow in less than 30 days, equaling one billion cubic feet on Boston's streets. Public Works crews plowed 295,000 miles of roadway, or roughly 12 trips around the earth, removed over 30,000 truckloads of snow from city streets and melted 50,000 tons of snow at our snow farms.
In both bad and good weather, we are working to bring innovation to every neighborhood and to city government, and we are dedicated to learning new ways to connect to each other and meet our shared challenges. Solving problems is the innovator's path to transformative ideas. Boston's problem-solving power is not limited to one person, one building or one neighborhood. It is woven throughout the fabric of the City of Boston.
