Washington (CNN)The man who climbed the White House fence on Sept. 19 and charged up the North Lawn before unlawfully entering the President's residence has pled guilty to two federal charges stemming from the incident.
Omar Gonzalez was originally charged with two counts of felony assault on a police officer, four counts of resisting and unlawful entry, and one count of making threats. But in a plea deal with prosecutors, he will only be sentenced for one count of unlawful entry and one count of assaulting officers.
