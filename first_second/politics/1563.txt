Proving that there isn't a damn thing this president can do to endear himself to members of the opposing party, congressional Republicans today penned another angry letter, their second just this week, but this time aimed at First Dog Bo. Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), lead author of the first open letter sent to Iran, reported that this new iteration directed at Bo was merely a variation on the theme of the original. "Similar to the letter drafted to Iran, we maintain that Bo's current residence at the White House in no way guarantees him a permanent home there once a new president is elected. Obama will be gone in under two years, but we do not plan on ever leaving." When informed by the press that Bo is certain to move with the Obama family before the next president takes office, Cotton remained mule-stubborn as only a politician can. "Make no mistake. Bo will leave the White House, come hell or high water."
In signing the letter alongside Cotton, 46 other ill-advised Republicans provided additional, completely unnecessary proof of their deep hatred for both President Obama and adorable dogs. One anecdote related by Senator Mitch McConnell from Kentucky underscored his abhorrence of Bo. "He peed on my shoe, plain and simple. The left one."
