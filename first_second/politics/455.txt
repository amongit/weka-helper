The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Thursday that it had raised $6.1 million in May, yet again setting a record for the most money raised in a particular month during a non-election year.
This year, the chief political arm of the House Democrats has repeatedly posted strong fundraising numbers despite representing the minority party in the House of Representatives. While the National Republican Congressional Committee has not yet released its fundraising totals for May, the Democratic committee has out-raised its Republican counterpart in each previous month in 2012.
