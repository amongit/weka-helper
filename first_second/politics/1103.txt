House Speaker John Boehner was on the television earlier today trying to explain why House Republicans have shut down the government and won't reopen it. Among other talking points, he trotted out the hoary assertion that we have a spending problem.
But while it's true that we have a spending problem, it's not the sort he imagines. The fact is that we haven't been spending enough. Or to put it another way, we have an austerity problem.
