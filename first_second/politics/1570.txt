Earth Day will turn 45 years old next month, and plans are underway for a big party on the National Mall. The Earth Day Network is organizing a celebration on April 18 that will combine star-studded musical performances with serious business, including commitments by national and international officials to marry the goals of curbing climate change and ending poverty. Everyone is invited.
