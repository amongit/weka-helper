Five Things You Should Know Today:
Anti-Terror “Kindred Spirits”: President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron met for the second day at the White House, with security and the bloody terrorism saga unfolding across Europe dominating their talks. CNN reports an intelligence source estimates there could be as many as 20 violent extremist jihadi cells peppered across France, Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands. Those units, the CNN source said, consist of up to 120 members each, prepared to carry out strikes similar to the massacres that played out in Paris last week. The U.S. and U.K. will also hold joint cybersecurity “war games” to probe weaknesses in each other’s internet security systems. As if there wasn’t enough to worry about.
