As polls show a movement toward Republicans—the new ABC News/Washington Post survey shows a 6-point GOP advantage in the generic ballot—there is increasing interest in what would happen over the next two years with Republican control of both the House and Senate. I first addressed the prospect of a Republican Senate in March, and I wrote last week about how independents could shake up the balance in an evenly divided Senate. Now, some more reflections on governance with a Republican Congress in the final two years of a two-term Democratic president.
I confess, I laughed out loud at George Will's gushing encomium to Mitch McConnell, predicting that McConnell, who "burns in indignation" at the degradation of his beloved Senate, "would … emulate his model of majority leadership—the 16 years under a Democrat, Montana's Mike Mansfield. He, like McConnell, had a low emotional metabolism but a subtle sense of the Senate's singular role in the nation's constitutional equilibrium." I knew Mansfield, who was taciturn but had immense dignity and, when you got to know him, warmth. He put process ahead of politics and decency ahead of ambition. To be frank, I don't see a lot of Mansfield in McConnell (as I noted last week, the best portrait of McConnell comes in a new e-book by Alec MacGillis called The Cynic. The best portrait of Mansfield is in a book by journalist Don Oberdorfer, titled Senator Mansfield: The Extraordinary Life of a Great American Statesman and Diplomat. Not many parallels there.)
