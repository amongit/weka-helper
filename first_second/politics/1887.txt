BALI, Indonesia â€” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ridiculed the expense of the U.S. election, mocking it as a "battleground for capitalists" while speaking at a democracy forum.
Ahmadinejad's own government has been criticized for human rights abuses and sanctioned for pursuing a nuclear program many suspect is aimed at obtaining weapons. A day after Americans re-elected President Barack Obama, the Iranian president told the forum in Indonesia that democracy has become a system where the minority rules over the majority.
