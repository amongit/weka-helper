The New England Patriots find themselves the subject of another NFL investigation after officials found 11 of the team’s 12 game balls were deflated beyond league regulations during the Patriots' 45-7 blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the Jan. 18 AFC title game.
The scandal has been dubbed “Deflategate” in the latest reference to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation from office.
