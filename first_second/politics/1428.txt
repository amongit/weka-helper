PADUCAH, Ky. –- On paper, the U.S. Senate race here shouldn’t be a race at all.
The incumbent is Sen. Mitch McConnell, 72, a five-term powerhouse and the Republican leader in the Senate. He is in line to become majority leader if, as is possible, the GOP picks up a net of six seats in November’s elections.
