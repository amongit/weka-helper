Sometimes political coverage at the national level is unsurprisingly predictable. Take the battle for control of the United States Senate. After months of denying and then downplaying the GOP’s chances to muster a majority in the 2014 election, a consensus now exists in the media that it is likely the Republicans will come out of it with 51 seats or more.
GOP jubilation is likely to be short-lived, however. The reporters who now concede a GOP majority in the United States Senate over the next two years are also taking pains to point out, as Politico and other publications are now doing, that with 26 Republican seats and just 10 held by Democrats up in 2016, the odds already favor the Democrats’ return to leadership in the chamber.
