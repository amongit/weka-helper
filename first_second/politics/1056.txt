I was going to weigh in again on the Jeb Bush 2016 buzz (this time driven by a weekend confab at the George H.W. Bush presidential library celebrating the 41st president) and the problems that the former Florida governor would face if he runs, but the Washington Monthly’s Ed Kilgore went and did it for me.
Specifically, Kilgore addresses the various facets of the dynasty problem Jeb Bush would face if he tries to become the third Bush in a quarter century to bear the GOP presidential standard. First there’s the Clinton defense – if the Democrats nominate Hillary Clinton, the argument goes, “that takes the issue away,” as GOP operative Ron Kaufman told the New York Times. “It’s pretty hard to say, ‘Oh, another Bush’ when you’ve got another Clinton,’” Kaufman said.
