Author and national correspondent Ta-Nehisi Coates is making a major pitch in a front cover story for The Atlantic, and he is not stopping there in stirring up a public debate on reparations to African-American families whose ancestors suffered under the yoke of slavery and Jim Crow oppression. He rightly says that to have a venerable magazine (founded in the furious prelude to the Civil War) take the idea seriously enough to give it a full treatment, well, that's something that could be the start of something.
In an elegant argument, Coates has noted that Germany made reparations to Holocaust survivors and their families, a point which resonated in the beautiful old synagogue where people gathered to hear his case.
