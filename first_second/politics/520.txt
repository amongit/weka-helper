Despite some erosion, Hillary Clinton's favorable rating still bests those of the other 2016 contenders. Polls show challenges for Jeb Bush but may not hold back endorsements. And positive feelings about vaccinations are on the rise. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 13, 2015.
CLINTON'S FAVORABLE RATINGS AHEAD OF OTHER 2016 CANDIDATES - Jeffrey M. Jones: "Hillary Clinton is one of a few potential 2016 presidential candidates to have a significantly higher favorable (50%) than unfavorable (39%) rating among the American public. And the 89% of Americans who are familiar enough with Clinton to have an opinion of her is more than any other potential 2016 presidential candidate. Clinton's relatively high scores on both dimensions give her a better starting position regarding her image than other competitors would have in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. These results are based on a March 2-4 Gallup poll of 1,522 U.S. adults, conducted just as revelations about the private email account Clinton used to conduct business while secretary of state became a major news story, but before her Tuesday press conference addressing questions about the issue."
