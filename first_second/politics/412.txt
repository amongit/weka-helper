New Delhi: Based on their respective strengths, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the two largest parties in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, are all set to lock horns in the February 7 elections in the national capital. Riding on the Narendra Modi wave, the BJP is buoyed by the victories in the recent elections in several states while AAP is struggling hard to make a comeback after suffering a major blow in the Lok Sabha elections.
AAP is banking on garnering the support of marginalised sections of the society and the minorities. For the Congress, the upcoming election is likely to be a battle for survival.
