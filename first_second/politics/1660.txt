The Republican National Committee announced on Wednesday that it will hold the convention where it will choose the party's next nominee for president in mid-July 2016, considerably earlier than the event has been held in the past.
The Republican National Convention will be held from July 18 to July 21 in Cleveland, Ohio. RNC chairman Reince Priebus pushed up the convention in an effort to give the party more time to unite behind its presidential candidate going into the November elections. In a statement, Priebus said that the earlier convention would allow the GOP candidate to use funds that are inaccessible until the candidate is officially chosen.
