First lady Michelle Obama urged Democratic donors at a fundraiser in Los Angeles Wednesday to “write a big, fat check” to help the party's incumbents and challengers win in November.
The event -- held in a gated community at the home of Phil Rosenthal, the creator of “Everybody Loves Raymond" -- benefited the Democratic National Committee.
