Welcome to Saturday – yes, Saturday – the 58th day of 2015 and the third day of life on Planet CPAC, aka the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, a place where the men are strong (like America’s military), the women are protected (like the Constitution) and the children will soon be freed from Common Core tyranny. Or perhaps not, if Jeb Bush, a big Common Core supporter, decides to run for the White House, and odds of that ticked up Friday after an onstage interview with Sean Hannity. The Smart Bush declared Common Core isn’t a government takeover, deflected more than a few jeers and – judging by the grassroots scuttlebutt – disarmed many CPAC hunters who see him as a RINO. Much of the conference’s star power and drama, however, swept out of the building along with the governor’s entourage, and the media quickly followed, leaving the conference to wonks and strategists. Here’s your special CPAC Brunch edition of Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in less time than it takes to read the Bill of Rights.
