With the midterm elections a week away, Republicans are making their final appeal to voters, emphasizing a harsh indictment of President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats for taking a dangerous path on national security.
"President Obama's actions threaten the safety of our country," said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a new digital ad entitled "Obama's Foreign Policy is on the Ballot." Priebus added: "While ISIS (an Islamic extremist group) plots ways to destroy our way of life and Ebola infects American citizens, the president continues to go around the Constitution and Congress to move terrorists from Guantanamo Bay into our nation. This November, the president's policies appear on the ballot. I urge you to vote Republican to keep terrorists off U.S. soil." Regarding Guantanamo, Priebus was apparently referring to a Wall Street Journal report that Obama is considering unilateral action to bypass Congress and close down the controversial detention facility at Guantanamo after the midterm elections.
