President Obama survived a terrible week in Washington unscathed in the eyes of the American people. Out there in the rest of the world, his poll numbers are still high.
But a shiver must have run through Obama as he heard the hue and cry from the news media and Republicans in Congress accusing him of being Nixonian and using the word "scandal" for the Benghazi affair and the Internal Revenue Service and Associated Press spying cases. The rough ride, captured by a picture of him frowning skyward at the rain in the Rose Garden, will not soon be entirely over or forgotten.
