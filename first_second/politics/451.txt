WASHINGTON -- House Democrats' chief political arm maintained a record-breaking fundraising pace in October, adding $7 million to its existing $25 million cash horde as campaigning for next year's election intensifies, according to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee aide.
The DCCC has raised more money at this point than in any prior election cycle, even when adjusting for inflation. The committee has raised $65.2 million through the end of October.
