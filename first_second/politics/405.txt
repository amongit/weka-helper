New Delhi: Amid reports that Shazia Ilmi may contest against Arvind Kejriwal from New Delhi Assembly seat, the former AAP leader on Wednesday said she will not fight the upcoming Assembly elections from anywhere.
In a late night tweet, Ilmi said, "Was invited to speak at the National Defence College. Couldn't take media calls. I am not contesting from New Delhi or elsewhere, calm down folks."
