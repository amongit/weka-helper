Add another major business group to the ranks of the Obamacare accepters. Randall Stephenson, the chairman and CEO of AT&T and also the chairman of the Business Roundtable, a powerhouse, pro-business lobbying group, this morning lumped Obamacare in with Social Security and Medicare as "key entitlements" that ought to be sustained and preserved.
Stephenson and Business Roundtable President John Engler appeared this morning at a press breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor to push the group's new four-point plan to pump the economy up to 4 percent economic growth. After 45 minutes of back-and-forth there had been nary a mention of the health care law, so I asked him where it fit in.
