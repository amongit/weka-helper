With the unpunished deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, race relations has been propelled to the front of political discussions once again. Protests have broken out across the U.S., with blacks and whites alike rushing into the streets and chanting slogans like "Black lives matter."
But perhaps unsurprisingly, polling data from Gallup show the perception of America's problems with race relations and opinions on potential solutions vary between blacks and whites. While whites have a more optimistic view of current race relations and generally don't feel government intervention is needed, blacks have seen less progress in recent years and think government intervention is one solution.
