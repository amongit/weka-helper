"It was a watershed year for women, and for feminism, as we refused to accept the pandemic of violence against women -- the rape, the murder, the beatings, the harassment on the streets and the threats online," writes Rebecca Solnit this week at the Guardian. "Women’s voices achieved a power that seems unprecedented, and the whole conversation changed."
It's true: 2014 was a banner year for feminism, at least here in the U.S., and the clamor of female voices demanding respect, autonomy and equality just seems to be getting louder. While Solnit focuses specifically on the rising tide against gendered violence, that was hardly the only way that feminism gained cultural traction this year. While the courts are busy chipping away at legal abortion and even contraception access, women themselves are actually getting more effective at controlling their own fertility. In pop culture, feminism has become downright trendy, from Beyoncé at the VMAs to Disney, of all companies, getting with the girl power program. Most major publications, including Slate, grapple seriously with women's issues. Even Cosmo set out to remake itself into an overtly feminist publication. So what's going to happen in 2015? I have no idea! What I do know is that feminism's trajectory tends to be cyclical. Multiple frenzies of feminist energy in American history have been followed by anti-feminist cultural backlash. After World War II afforded many women a relative independence, the "traditional" 1950s came along to put women back in the kitchen. The Reagan years were such a notorious backlash to the second wave of feminism that Susan Faludi wrote a classic book about it. The surge of feminism in the '90s descended into the religious right craze of the Bush era.
