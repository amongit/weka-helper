A boss sending an email to one of his employees doesn't usually make news. But President Obama and Hillary Clinton don't work in your average office.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed Monday that President Obama and Hillary Clinton exchanged emails while she served as his secretary of State. Usually, this would seem completely innocuous, if not entirely trivial. But Clinton's email use has been a hot topic for nearly a week now, following a New York Times report revealing that she used a secret email account—not a .gov address—to conduct official work at the State Department. The White House has neither defended the unofficial Democratic presidential candidate nor confirmed that she violated the Federal Records Act, which governs record-keeping practices for administration employees.
