Tonight, some lucky government official will be missing from the State of the Union crowd.
Flanked by security worthy of a president and an aide carrying the codes needed to destroy the world, this person will head to an undisclosed location during President Barack Obama's speech. In the event of an attack that killed Obama and other top government officials, this person would become president.
