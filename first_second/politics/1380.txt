WASHINGTON -- Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said she will introduce legislation Thursday that would require colleges and universities receiving federal aid to establish anti-harassment policies and to recognize cyberbullying as harassment.
The bill, called the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, was originally sponsored by the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and named for a Rutgers University student who committed suicide in 2010 after his roommate streamed video online of a sexual encounter between Clementi and another man.
