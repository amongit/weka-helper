Hillary Clinton may be the first nonincumbent presidential candidate in the modern era to, in effect, be coronated as her party’s nominee.
And on balance, this is likely to weaken her for the general election in November 2016. So far, she has a huge lead in the polls over all her potential Democratic rivals, such as Vice President Joe Biden, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. None of them strikes party strategists as a strong contender.
