"The American dream has become a mirage for far too many." --Jeb Bush
These are early days in the upcoming run for the White House in 2016, but already, among would-be Republican candidates, we see evidence of a tentative willingness to explore a set of contemporary ills that normally only figure in the election rhetoric of their Democratic opponents. These ills are the current high levels of income inequality in the United States, the contemporary squeeze on middle-class living standards, and the persistence of widespread poverty at the base of the American income pyramid. The ills are different, but they are related, and it is intriguing to see leading Republican politicians beginning to explore, however tentatively, the causes and consequences of some or all of them.
