We’re swimming in oil and gas.U.S. oil and natural gas reserves soared to new heights in 2013, unleashed by unconventional drilling methods that extracted more shale oil and gas than analysts previously expected, according to an Energy Information Administration announcement Wednesday. The increase has helped force oil prices to their lowest point in four years.
Oil production last year was at its highest in 31 years, the EIA said, driven by controversial hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – and horizontal drilling methods that have opened huge oil and gas deposits in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southwest.
