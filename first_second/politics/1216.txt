Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Thursday that the Islamic State terrorist group wreaking havoc in Iraq should be considered a growing and grave threat to the U.S. at home, even suggesting some of its fighters may have infiltrated the country through his state's broken border.
In a muscular speech at conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, Perry called on the U.S. to thwart the group’s momentum “by any means necessary,” advocating for sustained airstrikes against the extremists and even refusing to rule out sending back U.S. ground troops into Iraq as a possible remedy.
