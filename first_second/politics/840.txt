When Martin Sheen played the role of President Josiah Bartlet in the popular TV drama "The West Wing," he felt a responsibility to make a difference in people's lives. And today he is proud because so many say the show inspired them to enter public service or gave them an idealized vision of what the presidency can be.
"The West Wing" ran from 1999 to 2006, and the fact that it became a hit for so long surprised the cast and creators. It was, after all, a reality-based show about politics and government from a liberal viewpoint, themes that were suspect as television fare. Yet it still resonates. I interviewed Sheen for a public program at the Smithsonian in Washington Tuesday night, and it was clear that the series and the part he played remain touchstones for numerous people. This was certainly true for most of the 500 who crammed into Baird Auditorium to hear former President Bartlet hold forth for an hour and a half. Many were young, and they all came out on a cold, raw night even though many Washington institutions had closed because of a snow storm. They gave him many ovations, hung on every word, and lined up to get his autograph afterward. He happily obliged.
