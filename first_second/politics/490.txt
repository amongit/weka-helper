WASHINGTON D.C. -- "Joblessness is here to stay. One current assessment rates the chances a laid-off worker will ever regain his or her income level as only one in four," said Edward Corcoran, a Senior Fellow on national security issues at GlobalSecurity.org.
I recently met with Corcoran for lunch at Kramerbooks, a bookstore/cafe combo within walking distance of the White House. (The location made it impossible to ignore President Barack Obama's stupefying tone deafness to the pervasive unemployment problems facing millions of Americans.) Corcoran studies joblessness in part because he views it as a national security threat. High unemployment rates, especially among young workers, have led to protests in countries as varied as Latvia, Chile, Greece, Bulgaria and Iceland, and have contributed to strikes in Britain and France.
