DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) â€” A former Iowa lawmaker has pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from his switch of support from one Republican candidate for president to another before the 2012 caucuses, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
Former state Sen. Kent Sorenson received thousands of dollars in "under the table payments" before switching loyalties from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, whose state campaign he headed in Iowa, to then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, and then lying to federal investigators about the money, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Prosecutors refused to say which campaign paid him.
