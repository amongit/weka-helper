Alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise and poor diets have all been shown to increase the risk of cancer â€“ but few Americans realize this, according to a new survey published Wednesday to mark World Cancer Day.
Instead, people tend to blame risk factors for cancer on food additives, genetically modified foods, stress and beef hormones. Falsely identifying risk factors means many American do not know there are lifestyle changes they can make to help lower the possibility that they might get cancer.
