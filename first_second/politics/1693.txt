Since it is the end of one year and beginning of a new one, there is nothing I am more certain of than that Democrats want to close the book on 2014. An election cycle which offered little in the way of hope and far more change then anyone anticipated. It is precisely these moments that it's necessary to question conventional wisdom and think through what went wrong in order to improve the next time around. The good and bad of politics is that there's always another campaign cycle to do better -- or worse. The best lesson I think that Democrats can take away from 2014 is that Howard Dean was right.
Interestingly, my own history with Governor Dean goes back to his campaign for president, when very early on I heard him speak on CSPAN. I was impressed with his speech and starting telling my friends and family in Iowa to watch out for him, because he was going to do much better than the conventional wisdom of the day thought. I think he was polling around 2 or 3% at the time. Telling people about Gov. Dean brought me into contact with a close friend of his, who has since become a close friend of mine. This friend had a crazy idea: if the Democrats reached out and registered eligible voters, we would expand the overall voter pool such that a few newly registered voters could change the outcome in a big way. Since I was in grad school and had access to all sorts of data, he asked me to prove or disprove his theory so that we could present it to Gov. Dean.
