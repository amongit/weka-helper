House Speaker John Boehner is the Republican guy Washington is buzzing about. He spoke truth to power about the tea party, at long last, upon the emergence of a budget deal with the Senate. But someone close is about to steal his thunder.
Let's give him his due: Good for you, John, for standing up to those bullies. You were the head inmate running the asylum, but dang, you got no respect! The budget deal and your coming out as your own man are the closest things we have to a Christmas miracle in the capital. No more government shutdowns is a joyful thing to behold.
