At least since the 2012 parliamentary elections, in both May and June, Greece has been the European country to invoke the most dire predictions for the future. Although far right parties have gained three to four times as much electoral support in other European countries, the roughly 6 percent of the vote for the, until then unknown, Golden Dawn (XA) party has unleashed hordes of journalists on the crisis-ridden country -- hopefully compensating at least for some of the lost tourism income -- and have put commentators into a frenzy. Mostly asking rhetorical questions, like "is fascism back in Europe?, (self-) proclaimed experts from all over the globe harked back to the inevitable trauma of Weimar Germany to 'explain' the current situation in Greece. Some even went as far as to claim that the "Weimar on the Aegean" is the future of all of Europe!
The idea is simple: economic crisis breeds frustration that leads to the support for anti-democratic parties. After all, wasn't it the Great Depression that created Adolf Hitler? Yes, to an extent it was, although Hitler never achieved more than one-third of the vote and his ascent to power was made possible by na√Øve and opportunistic behavior of the political establishment. More importantly, that same Great Depression did not lead to extreme right parties coming to power through elections in other countries. In other words, Weimar Germany was the exception, not the rule.
