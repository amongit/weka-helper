WASHINGTON â€” The advocacy group born out of President Barack Obama's campaign organization raised just under $4.9 million in its debut quarter, a modest sum illustrating the challenges of keeping campaign-year fervor alive once the voters have all gone home.
Organizing for Action told supporters Friday that more than 109,000 people donated money to the fledgling group, with the average donor handing over about $44. The group claimed that the preponderance of low-dollar contributions reflected powerful grassroots momentum.
