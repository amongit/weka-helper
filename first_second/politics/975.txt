The Democrats have never really had to pay a price for “Jim Crow,” the legal structure they imposed and defended for decades that kept the American South segregated by race during the period between the end of Reconstruction and the passage of federal civil rights legislation beginning in 1964. Instead, it is the Republicans who are accused of being the party that tries – and has for decades succeeded – to obtain political advantage by pitting whites against blacks.
First, it was former President Richard Nixon’s so-called “Southern Strategy,” which liberal historians have defined as blatant appeals along racial lines to voters in the states of the old Confederacy to pull them into the GOP column. There are many faults with the theory – the least of which is that Democrats were already leaving the party for a host of reasons related to cultural issues and not just race by 1968, when Nixon defeated both Vice President Hubert Humphrey and segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace to win the presidency. It is accepted as fact so much that Bush 43-era Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman once issued a public apology for it.
