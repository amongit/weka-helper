Hillary Clinton’s chances of not running for president in 2016 are as high as 40 percent, veteran political handicapper Charlie Cook said Tuesday morning, up from his previous estimate of 30 percent.
Cook appeared at a breakfast sponsored by National Journal and United Technologies, giving a tour d’horizon of the political landscape in 2014 and beyond. His conclusion: The GOP has a slight advantage this year – he gives the Republicans a soft 60 percent chance of taking the Senate – but deep problems in 2016 and beyond.
