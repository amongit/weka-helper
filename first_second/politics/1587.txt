One thing is clear in the home stretch of the battle between Ryan Call and Steve House to be the next leader of Colorado's Republican Party: The race could have used a few more reporters like the Colorado Statesman's Ernest Luning covering it. As it is, "coverage" of the race has mostly been left to a bizarre and sometimes toxic shooting gallery of talk radio, Facebook, more Facebook, progressive bloggers (including yours truly), whisperers, and more whisperers. Honestly, this situation, set against a backdrop of intense GOP anger and madness, doesn't serve Republicans or the rest of us.
The candidates have spoken directly to lots of the Republican activists who will be voting Saturday, which is good, but the race for Republican chair is an excellent example of what won't be covered at all by real journalists as the profession fades. And we all lose from that.
