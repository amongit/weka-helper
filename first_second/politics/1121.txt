CONCORD, N.H. -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker beat back a barrage of questions Saturday insinuating that he had flip-flopped on a slate of issues, calling the charge “ridiculous.”
Following a speech to New Hampshire Republican activists, the 2016 presidential hopeful told a swarm of reporters that the flip-flop narrative had been cultivated by “other campaigns,” but did not cite anyone specific.
