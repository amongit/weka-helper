For the last six years, Florida has been a battleground state. But not over what you immediately think. Florida has been a battleground for voting rights -- the center of a power struggle that has mirrored fights across the country. From expanding early voting hours to eliminating early voting days, and from mandating photo ID to nearly criminalizing voter registration drives, Floridians have seen the national drama over voting rights play out right here in the Sunshine State. And the same playbook has been used in state after state.
Manipulating the right to vote is as old as our country, and is not unique to Florida, North Carolina or the entire United States. The history of our country is the history of tortured progress from a highly restricted franchise to the expansive one we enjoy today. The powerful only begrudgingly opened the ballot box to the disenfranchised, and then only when made necessary by force, economics or changing demographics. America is "rare among developed countries in the level of politicization that occurs around voting rights," Sean McElwee recently wrote in Politico.
