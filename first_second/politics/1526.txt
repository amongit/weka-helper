The election and reelection of President Barack Obama probably have even more significance than you realize. I generally take the longer view and think Supreme Court nominations are the most significant actions U.S. presidents take, but I'm not referring to anything Obama has already done or will do in the future. I mean the election itself; it made democracy better--maybe.
Trial by jury is among the most important features of the U.S. legal system. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads, in part, "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . . ." We also have a guaranteed right to trial by jury in many civil cases. In addition to having the right of a jury trial, citizens also have the right to engage in what has been called a "central mechanism for direct democracy in America." Initiative, when citizens put constitutional provisions or statutes on the ballot, and referendum, which lets the public vote on laws already passed, are both features that allow for the public to exercise democratic power, rather than elect others to represent their interests. The federal courts draw juries, in large part, from voter registrations. The elections of President Obama drew the largest electorate ever (per capita). Racial minorities turned out in record numbers, notably changing the shape of political views on immigration reform.
