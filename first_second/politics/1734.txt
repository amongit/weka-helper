The so-called Islamic State (IS) continues to demonstrate the most barbaric and heinous forms of torture, killing of innocent people for the world to witness in horror. The recent killings of Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto of Japan, the burning alive of Jordanian pilot Moaz Kasasbeh and the cold-blooded killing of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya highlight the new lows of brutality to which the so-called Islamic State has sunk.
I say "so-called" as it is absolutely clear that ISIS is in fact a criminal organization perverting the true teaching of Islam in unstable countries in the Middle East. How could a religion, which teaches its followers to refrain from killing innocent souls (see Quran 5:33) be accused of inciting terrorism? How could someone blame Prophet Jesus in advanced Christian countries for poverty among the low-income community despite the fact that he taught us to look after the poor and destitute to become a true follower of him (see Mathew 19:21)?
