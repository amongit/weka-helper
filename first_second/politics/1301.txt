Happy TGIF, the 23rd day of the year and the first weekend of the 2016 presidential campaign, at least on the Republican side, with two important see-and-be-seen events on the GOP primary calendar in two different climates — balmy Palm Springs, California, playground of the wealthy, and frigid, corn-belt Iowa. It’s also the day before President Barack Obama makes a rare state visit to India to help it celebrate its Independence Day, which includes a crowded, open-air event that’s giving big headaches to an already-beleaguered Secret Service. It might be an easier visit if the president had chosen invisibility when a YouTube interviewer, at the end of a strange Q-and-A session asked him which superhero power he’d choose for himself — more on that in a minute.
