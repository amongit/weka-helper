On the sunlit first day of fall, Washington parted ways with London's Globe Theatre, which brought "King Lear" to the nation's capital for a much-too-short run at the Folger Theatre. After opening in that warm space a couple of weeks ago, the Shakespeare's Globe tour moves on to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which may explain the touch of melancholy in the air. Washington doesn't like to lose to Philadelphia.
In honor of the Bard's 450th birthday this year, the Globe is quite literally spanning the globe in an effort to perform one of his plays in every country. The American tour will take in the coasts and last about three months. The British Ambassador to the U.S., Peter Westmacott, gave the cast a jolly good welcome here.
