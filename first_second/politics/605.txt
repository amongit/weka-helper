The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was attacked with a 10-inch knife on Thursday morning. The man who carried out the slashing, Kim Ki-jong, is an anti-U.S. activist with nationalistic views.
According to a report from The Hankyoreh, a major Korean newspaper, Kim posted on Facebook on March 2 to express his opposition to the Key Resolve-Foal Eagle military exercises, an annual series of joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea that routinely generate tension between North and South Korea. Even while Kim was being transported to the Red Cross Hospital after his attack on the ambassador, he continued to chant, “I oppose the Key Resolve exercises,” The Hankyoreh reported.
