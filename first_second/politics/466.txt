WASHINGTON -- On May 2, 2007, President George W. Bush issued only the second veto of his presidency, sending back to Congress a bill that would have appropriated $124 billion for the Iraq and Afghanistan War while including a deadline for withdrawal from the former. In July, Senate Democrats took a whack again, this time introducing a bill that would have imposed a 120-day deadline for the start of combat troop withdrawals. The bill couldn't clear a filibuster. They pushed additional measures to revoke the initial war authorization, amendments to cut off funding by early 2008, and more bills to begin an expedited timeline for withdrawal.
None of it became law. Along the way, the party made concessions. They passed supplemental bills to keep military operations going, even as Congress continued to debate the war. And by the end of the year Democrats caved entirely, passing a budget bill that included funding for Iraq.
