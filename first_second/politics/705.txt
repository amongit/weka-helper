Ebola has gotten much attention on the world stage compared to other infectious diseases, like malaria, that occur more frequently. But Tuesday even malaria got some good news: The number of deaths from the mosquito-borne parasitic disease has fallen dramatically from 2000 to 2013 and cases are declining steadily, according to the World Health Organization.
Still, the report says progress on malaria in countries affected by Ebola is at particular risk. In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia – the countries most affected by Ebola – 6.6 million malaria cases have been diagnosed, and 20,000 resulted in death. Ebola also is deadly, and has killed more than 6,300 people, according to latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority inpatient health facilities remain closed in these countries, the report states, while attendance at outpatient facilities is down to a small fraction of rates seen prior to the outbreak.
