It's Thursday, the 43rd day of 2015 and the third month since President Barack Obama nominated Loretta Lynch to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, not a friend of Republicans in Congress. Her confirmation hearings in the Republican-dominated Senate ended two weeks ago, and it’s been four months since Holder said he’s leaving, yet Republicans aren’t going to vote on her nomination anytime soon, and Democrats accuse them of deliberately slow-walking it. By contrast, Obama’s defense secretary nominee, Ash Carter, practically blazed through the process: His bid will likely get a Senate vote today, less than two weeks after he got the thumbs-up from the Armed Services Committee. Probably just a coincidence. Here’s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less, or your next one’s free:

Then they’ll probably overwhelmingly vote to let the president continue. Because, checks and balances.
