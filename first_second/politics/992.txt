Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt used an appearance on NPR on Monday to announce his company was cutting ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization composed of private companies and state legislators, over the group’s position on “climate change.”
“Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place," Schmidt told NPR’s Diane Rehm. "And so we should not be aligned with such people – they're just, they're just literally lying.”
