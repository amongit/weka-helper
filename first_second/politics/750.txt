The distinguished author and journalist Robert Timberg is a Marine who writes like a dream. In a clear confiding voice, his autobiography "Blue-Eyed Boy" speaks to you like an American Proust, straight from the start: “Falling asleep is never a problem for me. Waking up always is.” As he approached age 70, he at last let himself look back at the jagged scenery of his life, at his son Craig’s urging. There’s a hardwon beauty in those crevices.
But Timberg had much bigger peaks to scale than sweet Marcel, Proust’s Parisien alter-ego, who starts out saying: for a long time I went to bed early. Timberg’s Vietnam War wound cleaves his life in two, before and after. His face was burned beyond recognition by a land mine, an injury that required 30 reconstructive surgeries. But still they did not bring back the “reasonably good-looking” young married man he was. That sense of self was gone forever.
