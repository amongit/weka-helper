LANSING, Mich. (AP) - After Tess Brown lost her job at Lansing Community College, she submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records that might help her understand why, after 18 years, LCC believed her position no longer was needed.
Twenty days later, an LCC official responded - not with records but with estimates of retrieval time and the cost of fulfilling her request. LCC said it could take more than 2,400 hours to locate the records and likely cost Brown more than $48,000.
