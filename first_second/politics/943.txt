Can anyone really say they’re surprised that President Barack Obama hasn’t gone down for the count despite the thumping he and his policies got in the November election? He’s been crisscrossing the country in advance of Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, teasing out an agenda for his last two years in office that exceeds the wildest dreams of the most devout followers of the late Eugene V. Debs.
He’s promising “free this” and “free that” to anyone who cares to listen. Lift up the poor on the backs of the rich is an inspiring idea to those who believe they will be lifted up; in practice, that kind of talk usually leads to blood in the streets because, as a matter of economics and of social policy, it simply doesn’t work.
