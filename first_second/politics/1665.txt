WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers expressed outrage at a provision slipped into the omnibus government funding bill that would expand the amount wealthy donors can give to national political party committees.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the leader of the House Democrats, called for the provision to be pulled from the bill, along with another measure related to the deregulation of derivatives trading.
