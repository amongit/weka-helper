Obamacare may have contributed to a slowed rate of increase in health insurance costs, but that does not result in savings for individual workers, who in the last decade have been contributing significantly more to the cost of premiums, a new report shows.
The report, published Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund, found that the rate of growth for premium costs for employer-sponsored health insurance was higher before the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature health care reform law. Premiums increased 4.1 percent each year between 2010 and 2013, compared to 5.1 percent each year from 2003 to 2010.
