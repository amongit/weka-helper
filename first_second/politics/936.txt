Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is urging his colleagues to join with him in an effort to block the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general of the United States.
Heâ€™s right, but most of his Republican brethren are unwilling to go along with him. Leaving aside the reputation the junior senator from the Lone Star State is developing for being one to march to a different drummer, the fact is that Lynch's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee did little to convince anyone that she is the right person to clean up the mess inside the U.S. Department of Justice.
