"The Professor and the President" is a slim volume, written by Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus and a bright Washington denizen since the Eisenhower 1950s. His memoir is an act of fond friendship for the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the polyglot Harvard professor who went on to be an advisor to President Richard Nixon, U.S. ambassador to India and a Democratic senator from New York until 2001. The book is a valuable witness to the inner workings of a secretive White House in process â€“ its policies and the clash of strong male psyches that shaped it. Lavish thanks given to former staffers, one now a senator, paint a picture of how Washington white men helped young Ivy League men advance in the pyramid of political power.
Only Hess could have written this double portrait of Moynihan and Nixon, early in his White House years. For one thing, Hess was there, and he was young. There's a streak of James Boswell, Samuel Johnson's biographer, in observations that come from a knowing character study. He also illuminates the ideological struggle between Moynihan and Arthur Burns, a pipe-smoking economist, over what became known as the Family Assistance Plan, largely Moynihan's initiative. (The initiative did not pass in Congress. But Moynihan gave it a good college try.)
