The Supreme Court recently found that a Florida fisherman who had disposed of some undersized red grouper did not violate a provision of a federal statute concerned with the retention of business records and that prosecutors had perhaps been overzealous in pursuing the case.
If it were a Perry Mason Mystery it might have called “The Case of the Shredded Salmon.” As a matter of law, however, the five to four finding by the court in Yates v. United States (about which my bloleague Keith Rupp has more here) is a narrow thing. And, though I applaud the outcome – Yates was let off the hook – the court was wrong to find as it did.
