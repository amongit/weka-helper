Standing in front of Congress, President Obama started off with a John F. Kennedy quote from 51 years agoâ€”a reference to his own age, and an attempt to connect to Camelot in a generational passage.
Not a bad idea, and certainly his State of the Union speech had its moments. Next to his soaring second inaugural address just three weeks ago, however, it seemed like second best. Sorry, but it did not have the same inspired lift or tone. The president's voice sounded a bit weaker inside the chamber, his allies and enemies gathered round for this ritual.
