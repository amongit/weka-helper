The relationship between the White House and the press corps has gone sour and shows no sign of improving, according to an analysis by the Columbia Journalism Review.
There is "a gulf between the press and the head of state it's charged with covering," the report concludes, adding that the White House is "determined to conceal its workings from the press, and by extension, the public. The research...makes clear that the media most responsible for covering the president and his inner sanctum are given little insight into how decisions are made or who influences those decisions, whether from inside or outside the White House. Evidence suggests that the relationship between the president and the press is more distant than it has been in a half century."
