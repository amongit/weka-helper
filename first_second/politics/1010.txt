The news is full of Watergate recaps, most of which focus on what happened and how it all led up to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. All of it is as interesting today as it was 40 years ago, even though the American people now know a lot more about what actually happened.
The one thing we still don’t know is why. And we likely never will, which is unfortunate since that is perhaps the most interesting element of the whole shebang, as opposed to what motivated Nixon to authorize the cover-up – he was trying to prevent a political dirty tricks operation from being revealed and to minimize the political damage to his administration. Nixon had a plan in mind for a massive reorganization of the federal government, was pushing détente with the Soviets, had opened diplomatic channels to “Red” China, and carried 49 of the 50 states (while also losing the District of Colombia) in his 1972 re-election bid. He was at the top of the heap, the pinnacle of his power, and he had no intention of losing it over what others termed “a second rate break in” that was no worse than things his immediate predecessors had authorized during their campaigns.
