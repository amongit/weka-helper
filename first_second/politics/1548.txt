The buses have finally left, the barricades are being sent to wherever they came from, and Tampa is getting back to normal, whatever that is.
I took my wife and kids to several events at progressive rallies, independent rants and conservative venues, ending at the last show of Hardball with Chris Matthews at midnight on Thursday at Channelside. We felt that this was a rare event close to home and a great way to see all sides and show my two youngest daughters a view of the political process, so we went for a view of the widest scope, finally getting home at 2:30 a.m. on Friday morning.
