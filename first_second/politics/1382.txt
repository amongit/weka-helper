WASHINGTON -- Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told a group of women business leaders Tuesday night that while the political environment may get frustrating, women can't give up their seat at the table and walk away. She reiterated that she intends to run for reelection in 2016 because she isn't ready to "go home and yell at the television."
"If we give up as women in participating in this because it's too frustrating, we are handing it over to people who would be very happy to have that power," said Murray. "So I think it's really important that we step outside of ourselves and have the courage and don't let the little things get to you. Fight for what you believe in."
