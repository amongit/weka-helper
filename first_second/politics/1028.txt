The calculus for control of the U.S. Senate keeps becoming more and more complicated. The latest example comes from South Dakota of all places, where Democrats suddenly seem to hope that they can hold onto the seat that retiring Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson is vacating.
Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is preparing to dump $1 million into the contest, which has long been universally written off as a slam-dunk GOP pickup. According to Bloomberg, the committee has conducted four polls showing a tight race, and then yesterday a Survey USA poll showed an extremely tight race, with former Gov. Mike Rounds with 35 percent, narrowly ahead of former GOP Sen. Larry Pressler, who is running as an independent, and Democrat Rick Weiland at 28 percent. Rounds had been considered the prohibitive favorite for the seat, and while other polls had shown him deeply weak and Pressler gaining, the Survey USA poll is for now an outlier â€“ other public polls had Pressler comfortably in line to take a plurality of the vote.
