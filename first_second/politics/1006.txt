Let’s be clear: the indictment of Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry is completely, utterly and totally bogus. Moreover, it’s a sloppy effort to extract political revenge driven by a partisan prosecutor who has lost the public’s confidence and no longer deserves to hold the office to which she has been elected.
Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg is a national embarrassment. Her arrest for drunk driving was, as they say, caught on tape (as was her subsequent abuse of the police who arrested her). Not only was she weaving all over the road, but she also kicked her cell door once in custody, had to be put in restraints and was ultimately found to be intoxicated at almost three times the legal limit more than an hour after being stopped.
