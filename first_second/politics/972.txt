The election was just a week ago. In every race but a few, the ballots have been counted, the winners declared, and the Democrats are still sweeping up the debris and picking up carcasses off the floor.
Not since 1974 – when a Watergate-weary nation almost tossed the Republican Party into history’s ashcan has an American political party been beaten so badly. The Democrats were not just defeated so much as they were decimated.
