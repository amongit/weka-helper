GREELEY, Colo.—I was sitting around a dining-room table with a dozen other people, in a nondescript home in this city that has about 95,000 people and almost 500 oil and natural-gas wells. They were plotting a strategy that simultaneously engages with, and works against, energy companies.
“I just think it’s better if we play our cards a little closer to our chest,” said Therese Gilbert, a middle-school teacher and a steering committee member of Weld Air and Water, a small (just 100 members) citizens’ group concerned about growing energy development in Weld County, one of the most drilled counties in the United States, with more than 15,000 wells.
