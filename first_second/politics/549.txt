A Kentucky Senate committee on Monday approved a bill that would require transgender students to use restrooms designated for "their biological sex," days after an identical measure failed.
The legislation, introduced last month, would require schools to “provide separate, private areas designated for use by students based on their biological sex” rather than their gender identity.
