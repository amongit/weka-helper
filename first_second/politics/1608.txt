What kind of Zionist? I have been a fervent Zionist, a disappointed Zionist, a proud Zionist, a rebellious Zionist, a fatigued Zionist, a post-Zionist, a pristine Zionist. There are, as I reflect on it, only two kinds of Zionist I have not been: I have not been a disillusioned Zionist, because I have never and still do not regard the highest hopes of Zionism as illusions. And I have not been a Zionist who has cast his daily physical lot with the citizens of Israel, unless we count -- I don't -- vicarious casting as a sort of ersatz aliyah. No, as involved as I have been since roughly the age of 11 in Israel's triumphs and its crises, as considerable the time I have spent defending and protecting Israel from afar, I remain a Zionist who has been present not at the center but at the periphery.
