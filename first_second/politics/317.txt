Overhauling the tax code is one of those broad Washington ideas that everyone supports in theory until the specifics come into focus. The same goes for tackling income inequality. How nice these grand ideas sound on bumper stickers or campaign buttons! It's the details that kill the bipartisan buzz. After all, the details don't just bring out armies of lobbyists; they can also highlight the vast differences between the two parties on such hot-button issues as the economy, taxation, and government spending.
Filling in those details, however, will be imperative if the House hopes to move ahead in 2015 with tax reform, a priority of Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who now chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. Congress must also decide whether to extend dozens of tax breaks that expired at the end of last year, including incentives for small businesses and charitable donations.
