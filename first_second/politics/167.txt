The troubled VA is still struggling to find its footing and even get a grip on the problems, a congressional committee will hear Monday in a prime-time hearing as lawmakers take stock of the department nearly a year after whistleblowers exposed bureaucratic bungling and veterans dying while waiting for care.
The House Veterans Affairs Committee will look at improving transparency at the Veterans Affairs Department and the department’s inspector general’s office, which prepared reports on troubled facilities such as Phoenix or Tomah, Wisconsin, but never released them, essentially keeping problems hidden, the committee says.
