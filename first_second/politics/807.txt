While Congress slept, other elements of spring in Washington sprang, popped and spoke up to be heard. Truthfully, it was nice for those who really live here to get in a word edgewise during the Easter recess. The cherry blossoms aren't yet at their April peak, floating in a sea of pale pink around the Tidal Basin, framing the Jefferson memorial but hey, who cares? They slow us down, in a place that moves too fast.
It just so happens that the Women's History Discussion Group at the Library of Congress was talking about those blooms in March. The festival started in 1912, an ethereal gift from Japan. As you might suspect, a visionary woman stands in the backstory, unrecognized in this city of marble monuments to men.
