WASHINGTON -- After the Republican Party took control of the Senate, strengthened its House majority, picked up a host of state legislative chambers and elected a slate of new statewide candidates, various pronouncements were made about how the Democratic bench had been devastated. But there's more to the story.
The Huffington Post asked the party's national committees, as well as a variety of progressive advocacy groups that recruit and train candidates, to identify up-and-coming current or former officials whom they could see running for higher offices in the future. The reality Democrats face is a sobering one, as Republicans are in the majority in 68 out of the 98 partisan state legislative chambers and hold 31 governorships. So Democrats will have to get more creative, and persuasive, with their candidate recruitment to capitalize on 2016, which promises to be an easier year to inspire voters and draw them to the polls.
