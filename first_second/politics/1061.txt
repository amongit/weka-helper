Tuesday’s special election in Florida’s 13th Congressional District has sparked two related but distinct – and frequently conflated – debates among pundits and strategists. The first is whether incoming GOP Rep. David Jolly’s victory over Democrat Alex Sink represents a bellwether portending November doom for Democrats. The second is whether Democrats need to recalibrate their message surrounding Obamacare. The answer to the first question is “no,” but that doesn’t necessarily make the answer to the second “no” as well.
There is one way in which the Florida result can be seen as a sign of things to come, but not in the sense that it can be viewed as a gauge of the current national mood or an indicator of the atmospherics unique to this year’s race. It’s a reminder that Republicans have an advantage in midterm elections because the demographic groups that have recently carried Democrats to presidential victories simply don’t show up in the same numbers in off-years. If 2008 and 2012 signaled the decline of the cult of the Reagan Democrat, 2010 and, presumably, 2014 are throwbacks to the influence that those voters used to enjoy.
