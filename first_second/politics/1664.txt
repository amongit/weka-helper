Let's just say it one last time: 2014 was a rough year for Democrats. We had our asses handed to us, and with the exception of a few Democrats winning big races, it's abundantly clear that somewhere along the way we lost our voice. We forgot to tell people why we are Democrats. It's time for us to do a little soul-searching. So as we figure out what happened and get past this moment, as Democrats and Progressives struggle to find our own True North, let's get back to some strategy basics. There is a lot we can do better, which I have been writing about in recent blog posts, but one fairly simple thing we could do might not seem that important, yet it is: We can hold the DNC convention in Ohio in 2016.
I don't normally concern myself with where the party holds its nominating convention. Normally it doesn't matter much at all. I think this year might be a little different. I think it actually does matter for 2016.
