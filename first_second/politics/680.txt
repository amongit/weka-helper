The United Nations set ambitious goals in 2000 to reduce global poverty and inequality by 2015, and while it successfully cut extreme poverty in half, the multinational group is conflicted about how much developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa can improve by 2030.
The U.N. targets for progress were known as the Millennium Development Goals, which included cutting extreme poverty – which the group defined as people earning less than $1.25 per day – in half worldwide by 2015. The international community succeeded in that despite the global financial crisis of 2008 that damaged momentum toward reform. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wants to set a challenge of ending extreme poverty by 2030 now that economies have recovered in recent years.
