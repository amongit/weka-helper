TGIF, the 58th day of 2015 and the second full day of the Conservative Political Action Conference, aka CPAC, the annual right-wing conclave that some observers say can make or break a Republican presidential prospect and others liken to the bar scene from Star Wars (and suggest it should be taken about as seriously). There’s evidence for both arguments: nearly every Republican who might want to run in 2016 (and win the annual straw poll) is here; but so is someone dressed like Captain America, another person in an Iron Man costume, as well as some guy in Revolutionary War-era garb marching with a Gadsden flag. Then there was the right-wing street artist who described, in language we can’t use here, why he created a toilet seat with President Barack Obama’s face on it. Jeb Bush, the Thinking Man’s Conservative, strides into that rowdy scene for a speech Friday, and he better have some red meat ready or the far-right crowd will eat him instead.
