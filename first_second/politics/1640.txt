Matthew Torne, a British filmmaker, is coming to Southern California soon to show and discuss his documentary Lessons in Dissent, which analyzes the 2012 Hong Kong protests that were triggered by plans to bring mainland style patriotic education to the former Crown Colony. Completed just before the start of last fall's Umbrella Movement (which I wrote about for the Los Angeles Review of Books and other venues), the film (the Southern California screenings of which include ones at UCLA on February 23 and at UC Irvine on February 25) focuses on two student activists. One is Ma Jai and the other is Joshua Wong, who became the most widely recognized leader of the 2014 protest wave and was a runner up for TIME magazine's 2014 Person of the Year. I caught up with the filmmaker by email, while he was on the road showing his documentary in other parts of the United States, and he was good enough to provide me with answers to the following series of questions:
JW: I guess an obvious question to ask about a film dealing with the 2012 Hong Kong protests is how you see your documentary helping viewers make sense of what happened after it was shot. There are strong similarities between the scenes your film shows and some that flashed across small and large screens last fall, and there is continuity in the activists and leaders involved, too. What are some things that stand out to you as particularly striking when it comes to continuities between 2012 and 2014? And what are crucial differences to keep in mind?
