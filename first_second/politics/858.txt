President Barack Obama is turning to new media to get an extra boost for his State of the Union address.
Obama is scheduled to take questions Thursday from three people who have achieved fame on YouTube: Bethany Mota, who specializes in lifestyle videos; Hank Green, who generates a current events blog with his brother John Green, and GloZell, a comedian, White House officials say.
