Adm. Robert Papp, the U.S. top envoy to the Arctic, said Thursday that he is still in talks with Disney and hopes to use characters from the hit movie Frozen to raise awareness about climate change.
"We're continuing discussions with Disney. I'm hopeful we're going to get there," Papp said at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution in Washington. "It's a very good company, and they put out a good product, and I'd like to have them help us raise awareness."
