The recent election in Greece has brought a new party called Syriza to power, whose platform is economic stimulus not austerity. The austerity mindset, embraced by Germany and the International Monetary Fund, is known for imposing austerity, cutting government spending on public services and social benefits, and, finally, Greece had had enough. Voters realized that austerity was only prolonging the economic downturn by reducing the amount of money in circulation. The "tough love" posture of austerity makes for virtuous sound bites ("tighten your belt," "fiscally responsible," "balance the budget,") but it is bad economics. It relies on the false metaphor that household budgeting is the same as budgeting for a nation with its own sovereign currency.
The austerity mindset faces a new foe in the U.S. Senate as well. The re-shuffle of the last U.S. election that put austerity-minded Republicans in power has ironically resulted in a new anti-austerity economist being hired by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the Senate Budget Committee -- Professor Stephanie Kelton of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Professor Kelton is a proponent of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), a very pro-stimulus economic approach. Her hiring represents the biggest step forward for MMT, since the PR coup of the Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin in 2013. At that time, Kelton reportedly created the #mintthecoin hashtag that was featured in columns by Paul Krugman and others.
