Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's announcement earlier this week that he will not run next year for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Barbara Boxer came as something of a surprise, at least at this early date. Key associates of his had passed word that he would likely make the race. The announcement furthers the early lead of the still rather lightly known California Attorney General Kamala Harris but leaves open the question of Villaraigosa's political future, not to mention that of Latinos running for the top offices in California.
After the announcement, Villaraigosa journeyed to the Latino Legislative Caucus retreat in Napa to discuss the situation. There he told politicians who don't seem all that anxious to unite behind Harris, the daughter of an Indian physician mother and a Jamaican economist father, that his heart lies closer to home than Washington. Thus he kept the door very much open for a potential run for governor -- the office he began to seek in 2009 before deferring to Jerry Brown -- in 2018 when Brown will be prevented by term limits from winning a fifth term.
