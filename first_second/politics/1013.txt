Despite what the White House or anyone else says, there is no current scenario under which the leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives would move to take up impeach proceedings against President Barack Obama.
To do so would be playing into Obama’s hands. He wants the House to move against him. He thinks it would be a political winner that would salvage his party’s flagging fortunes, galvanizing his voters – who only show up when he is on the ballot – to go to the polls in November 2014 to keep the Democrats from losing the Senate.
