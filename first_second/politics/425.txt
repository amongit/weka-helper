As a child in Los Angeles, our home was the polling place for my neighborhood. At least twice a year I'd awaken to lines of neighbors filing in and out of our downstairs area in order to cast their ballots. Political discussions were always ringing in my ears. President Jimmy Carter and President Ronald Reagan were names that I heard regularly at our dinner table.
And I had always thought that my family was "bi-partisan," more interested in the process than the positions, until the day that my aunt decided to complete my sample ballot, indicating that I was to vote for Michael Dukakis. It was my first presidential election, and my Christian values had me leaning toward George Bush. My lifelong passion for politics sprang from the divide I experienced in my family. That was when it hit home how important it was for an individual to have a choice, and to be sufficiently well informed to make that choice wisely.
