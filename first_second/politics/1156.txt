The GOP field for president in 2016 could debate as many as a dozen times, with the first face-off slated for August, according to a Republican National Committee plan released Friday.
The tentative schedule is an attempt to shrink the number of debates from the 20 that took place during the 2012 campaign. The time frame over when the debates will occur is also set to be shortened by a couple of months.
