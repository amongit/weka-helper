Hope and history rhyme, as the late Irish poet Seamus Heaney told us. Yet American history is also cleft with a tragic rhyme that cuts deep to the marrow: President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863 and President Kennedy's assassination in Dallas in 1963. These events happened exactly 100 Novembers apart, a century and three days. These presidents reach across time in a profound dialogue that goes on like the Mississippi River cuts through East and West.
Ironically, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy spoke soaring presidential prose, showed great physical courage and were loved for their quick wits by countrypeople. That their strength and tongues could be stilled suddenly broke the country's heart in the best and worst of times. "When a great calamity has befallen the nation, we want the sun to be darkened and the moon not give her light," Lucretia Mott, the Philadelphia Quaker champion of human rights, wrote in 1865 about Lincoln's April night murder. That's roughly how grown men, women and children felt as they wept 50 years ago.
