Happy Presidents Day. We all love to worship an idealized version of our leaders--the guy in the top hat or the guy with the wig (and maybe one day the lady in the pantsuit). But what if you were president, what would you do? Could you do it? Could you handle the stress of it? Yes, your hair would go grey in four years, don't deny it.
