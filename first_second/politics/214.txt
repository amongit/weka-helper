Gov. Scott Walker dismissed claims that he is a flip-flopper on immigration today, saying that it's "just a narrative from the other campaigns in response to the fact that we have a strong reputation for keeping our word.
"This is one that we listened to the people all across the country-particularly the board of governors-and saw how this president messed that up and that's an issue where I think people want leaders who are willing to listen to people," Walker told media scrum after his speech at a state GOP event here.
