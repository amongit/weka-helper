President Obama sponsored a widely-heralded international "summit" to counter violent extremism at the White House the third week of February, urging national governments to broaden their response to ISIS beyond military intervention, boost economic and educational opportunities and robustly confront that organization's "warped ideology" as part of a heavily promoted Administration push to counter the Islamic State's appeal to disaffected young men across the Muslim world. Some Americans are annoyed about TV comedians making light of ISIS. But it's our government that's the real joker.
The first President to win the Nobel Peace Prize for showing up had it backwards as the U.S. underscored at the "summit" its alliances with some of the world's worst governments - dictatorships Islamic State and Muslim democrats alike define themselves against.
