A reported 127 million Americans plan to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day this year, as a group more than 26 times the Republic of Ireland’s total population plans to wear – and spend – some serious green.
Americans will shell out a combined $4.6 billion for the holiday – which officially falls on Tuesday – and spend an average of $36.52 per person, up from last year’s $35.78, according to a holiday report from the National Retail Federation.
