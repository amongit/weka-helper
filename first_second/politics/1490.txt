WASHINGTON -- Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday that his party will have fewer debates moderated by journalists from mainstream news outlets in the 2016 primary.
"I've certainly talked about non-news figures involved in the debates, even having potentially grassroots-type debates, having Lincoln-Douglas type debates, and also including traditional news as well," Priebus told a group of reporters at an event hosted by National Review. "Giving the cable companies a shot at a debate is something that I think we can do as well."
