In the midst of the Crimean crisis, Dick Cheney saw fit to undermine the commander in chief. "I also think he hasn't got any credibility with our allies," Cheney said Sunday on a CBS News broadcast, speaking of President Obama.
That's unseemly, to say the least, in a foreign policy crisis. A once-high official simply does not say such things about a sitting president, by protocol; George W. Bush is scrupulously silent these days. It's just Cheney's latest outrage; keeping track is like counting cattle.
