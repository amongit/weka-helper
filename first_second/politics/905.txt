There's more trouble brewing for the White House press corps.
This time, the issue is travel costs--namely, the estimated pricetag for journalists to accompany President Barack Obama on his trip to China, Burma and Australia next month. News organizations estimate that the cost of the chartered press aircraft will be $60,000 per person, possibly the most expensive in history. And that doesn't include the costs for hotels, ground transportation, press filing centers, meals and other expenses associated with globe-trotting with the president. These could raise the total pricetag of the nine-day Asia-Pacific trip to $70,000 per person, according to the Washington Post.
