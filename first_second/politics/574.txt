Scott Fistler, a GOP candidate from Arizona who previously failed at runs for both Congress and the Phoenix City Council, will now be running to fill Rep. Ed Pastor's (D-Ariz.) seat in the heavily Hispanic 7th congressional district. But this time, he'll be running as Cesar Chavez, a Democrat.
The Arizona Capitol Times reports that in November, Fistler petitioned a state superior court and paid $319 to legally change his name to that of the famous labor leader, stating in the petition that because of his name, he's "experienced many hardships."
