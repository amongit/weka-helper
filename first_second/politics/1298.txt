It’s a case of the drone coming home to roost, so to speak.
At a joint press conference Sunday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Barack Obama defended his use of lethal drone attacks during counterterrorism operations in the Middle East. Casting aside criticism — that the strikes are extrajudicial killings that have targeted some American citizens and killed dozens of innocent civilians — Obama said the strategy “is not neat and it is not simple, but it is the best option we have” short of boots on the ground.
