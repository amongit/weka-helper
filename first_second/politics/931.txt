More than anything it seems President Barack Obama is determined to have the U.S. government take control of the Internet before he leaves office. This, of course, is oddly ironic since he and his buddies around the globe are almost equally determined to get America out of the Internet business once and for all.
To the “tech heads” that follow every policy jot and programmatic tittle of Internet policy this is obvious. For the rest of us, understand that it is the Obama administration’s intention to transform the Internet inside the United States (with major and likely deleterious effects on price, content and innovation to follow), while removing the last vestige of U.S. control over its global governance.
