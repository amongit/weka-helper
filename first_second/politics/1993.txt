I am home alone, reflecting on the remarkable and blessed experiences of the past three days. Yesterday I sat at the steps of the State House in Montgomery, Alabama, listening to some remarkable reflections from a spouse and daughter of the 1960s. Juanita Abernathy, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr.'s constant companion, Ralph David Abernathy, and Peggy Wallace Kennedy, the daughter of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, gave moving testimonies of what it was like on opposite ends of the spectrum as wills were tested during the run-up to the March 7, 1965, march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.
I was particularly moved by Ms. Wallace Kennedy as she shared the experience of taking her son, Gov. Wallace's grandson, to the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia. After taking in some of the sights and sounds of the Center, her son asked her, "Why did Pa Pa do those things to other people?" Ms. Wallace Kennedy said that she answered her son by telling him that her father "never told [her] why he did those things" but that they were wrong, and that it would be "up to [them] to help make things right."
