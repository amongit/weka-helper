Britain is heading to the polls Thursday to vote in what at least one writer for the Times of London is calling "the most exciting election in a generation."
An election that was initially greeted with general disinterest has since been transformed into one that has gripped the nation, due in no small part to the jolt of energy provided by the unexpected, and game changing, emergence of Nick Clegg and the 'Cleggmania' he inspired. What once seemed a likely election victory for the Conservatives and their leader David Cameron all of a sudden became one of the most unpredictable campaigns in years.
