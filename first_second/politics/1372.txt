Democratic women senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that aims to make child care less expensive for working parents by expanding the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC).
The Helping Working Families Afford Child Care Act, introduced by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), would make low- and middle-income families eligible for a tax credit equal to 20 percent of their child care expenses, up to $8,000 for one child and $16,000 for two or more children.
