President Barack Obama is winding up his midterm election campaign with a special pitch to core Democratic constituencies, especially women and African Americans.
"Right now, women make up almost half our workers," Obama said in his weekend address to the nation. "More women are their family's main breadwinner than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing polices that benefit women--because that benefits all of us."
