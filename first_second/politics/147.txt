Washington (CNN)Supreme Court ideological opposites Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia, came together for a discussion on constitutional issues Thursday night, but their camaraderie and escapades stole the show.
"Why don't you call us the odd couple?" Scalia began, in a wide ranging conversation that included what really happened before Ginsburg attended the State of the Union, their thoughts on the Constitution as well as their habit of vacationing with each other. Scalia told a story about how they spent time together in the South of France once and Ginsburg decided to go parasailing.
