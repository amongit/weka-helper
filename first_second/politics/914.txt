President Barack Obama's potential callup of National Guard troops to help limit the Ebola epidemic in West Africa shows the extent of his new aggressiveness in fighting the deadly virus.
For the second consecutive day, Obama canceled an out-of-town trip to convene a meeting of his senior advisers regarding Ebola. Obama and his aides continued to map out a federal response to the outbreak in Texas, where two nurses contracted Ebola after caring for a Liberian man who died of the disease at a Dallas hospital.
