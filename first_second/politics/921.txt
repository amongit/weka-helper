Tomorrow’s new recruits to Occupy Wall Street and other social movements are today’s juniors and seniors on America’s college campuses. They’re busy waging a kind of war against the free market system, the very thing that makes their attendance at college or university and hopes for a prosperous future possible. They’re loading themselves up with debt they won’t be able to repay, if they succeed at biting off the hand that feeds them.
It’s alarming that their arguments have become couched in the language of preserving “academic freedom.” It’s their rallying cry when they attack professors and institutions they regard as suspect, leading them to compromise the very ideals of academic freedom they claim they’re trying to protect. If they miss the irony, it’s probably because English 101 was held at the same time as "Hollywood & Washington: Influencing the Political Process through Mass Culture" so they missed the lecture on rhetorical devices.
