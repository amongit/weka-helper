When the Senate failed last week to pass legislation enacting an extension of emergency unemployment insurance, the body came as close as it can to acting without doing so: Only 59 of the chamber’s 100 senators voted in favor of the bill – an overwhelming majority in the real world, but a feckless show of strength in the “saucer” of democracy.
But with the measures coming so close to passage, its proponents are trying to focus public pressure on persuadable Republicans to switch their votes. The next step in that effort comes in the form a pair of new polls released this evening by the progressive advocacy group Americans United for Change intended to demonstrate to GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois that they’re out of line with their constituents.
