New Delhi: In a clear U-turn, the Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi High Court that nothing objectionable was detected in the foreign funding of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
In the run up to the Delhi Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress had tried to corner AAP over the funding after some so-called former workers of the latter had alleged that it of irregularities and indulging in money-laundering. However, both the BJP and Congress will cut a sorry figure after the Centre gave a clean chit to AAP over foreign funding. The BJP put forth questions to AAP and published advertisements in newspapers on funding.
