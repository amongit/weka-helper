President Bush presented a flawed, even dishonest case for invading Iraq ten years ago in the middle of March. However hollow the "intelligence" on WMD, it worked out nicely as a pretext. Only 25 to 30 senators opposed the march to war. And all along, revenge for the September 11th terrorist attacks was the real reason. Everyone knew the truth in this shaken-up land of ours. We needed something to cheer us up, like a splendid little war.
As Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld now come under fresh scrutiny and a chorus of criticism (too little, too late), it's worth examining how the mainstream media fell in with the whole thing, and led the American public into a meek compliance. Not having a draft makes it much easier to go to war, as the Pentagon had noticed.
