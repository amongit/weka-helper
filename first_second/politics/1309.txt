Happy Tuesday morning, the 20th day of the year, and the 67th year since President Harry Truman took advantage of a newfangled technology – television – to deliver the 225th State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. President Barack Obama delivers his penultimate SOTU talk tonight; estimates suggest it will be his smallest television audience to date. Perhaps that’s why, like Truman, Obama will use new tech and conduct a batch of YouTube interviews following the speech. It’s also the sixth year since Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal delivered the Republican response to Obama’s first-term speech; his wooden performance all but killed his 2012 presidential aspirations. It was perhaps the most memorable of flops in a speech intended to showcase rising GOP stars but instead revealed some not-ready-for-prime-time players. Here’s your Three Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds, made fresh daily.
Spoiler Alerts: No one expects a blockbuster policy surprise during Obama’s State of the Union address tonight, since the economy seems on sound footing, and since he pretty much outlined his bullet points during a tour during the last two weeks (free community college, for example). But the overall theme will come into focus: Obama’s proposals are intended to help the still-struggling middle class, and draw a bright line between Democrats and Republicans ahead of 2016.
