The immigration fight just got a little more complicated for the Republicans. A federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of President Obama's new immigration policy, which has thrown a curve ball into the Republican congressional strategy of having a big political battle over immigration next week. Will they realize the ruling gives them a political "escape hatch" out of their unwinnable position? Will they use the legal case as an excuse to "kick the can down the road" a bit more? Or will they just go ahead and shut down the Department of Homeland Security anyway? These are really their only three viable options, and all of Washington is atwitter over which they'll choose to take.
The ruling was pretty predictable, since the Republicans went judge shopping to find the federal judge most opposed to the Obama immigration policy before filing their case. What happens next, legally, is not so predictable, but neither side should be counting on total victory at this point. The ruling itself is a standard sort of thing -- whenever a court case is winding its way through the system, judges routinely issue orders to preserve the legal status quo. As the judge wrote, you can't put toothpaste back in the tube. Obama's new program would have changed the status quo; therefore it is now on hold. But the ruling is not as sweeping as some are now pretending: It does not address the actual constitutionality of Obama's action at all, because the case itself hasn't been ruled upon. (It's just a temporary injunction, not a judicial decision.) So Republicans saying a judge has agreed with them that Obama's actions were "illegal" are simply not true, at least not yet.
