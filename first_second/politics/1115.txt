I'm admittedly late to this, but it's so jaw-dropping that it bears repeating. Greg Sargent posted a must-read yesterday afternoon breaking down the Washington Post's most recent polling on raising the debt ceiling. His startling – but inarguable – conclusion: That Republican voters want a debt ceiling crisis, "even if it causes serious economic harm." The emphasis there is his.
He notes that the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll finds voters about evenly split on raising the debt ceiling – 46 percent favoring and 43 percent opposing – while at the same time 73 percent feel that failing to raise the debt limit would "cause serious harm to the U.S. economy."
