WASHINGTON -- As President Barack Obama's immigration policies face threats from Congress and the courts, he met Wednesday with advocates to assure them he isn't going to bend on deportation relief for undocumented parents and those who came to the U.S. as children.
During a private meeting at the White House, Obama said he won't accept efforts by Republicans to tie restrictions on his policies to funding for the Department of Homeland Security, according to advocates who attended. Funding is set to run out on Feb. 27 unless a deal can be reached.
