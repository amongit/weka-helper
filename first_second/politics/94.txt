Washington (CNN)Eight of the last nine presidential elections have seen a Bush or a Clinton vying for a spot in the White House.
The only election since 1980 that didn't feature a Bush or a Clinton in some role was back in 2012, though a Bush and Clinton have only squared off head-to-head one time, in 1992, when Bill Clinton defeated President George H. W. Bush.
