The fall midterms are all the talk of the town, with increasing Republican relish and deepening Democratic gloom.
As for the man in the White House, well, it's only his presidency on the line. President Obama did allow that his party (the Democratic party) wasn't so good at this drill, recalling the tea party House triumph in 2010. But he has not let loose big bucks raised by his own Organizing for Action to support vulnerable Democrats defending their House and Senate seats. As The New York Times reported, that failure is setting off not-so-silent alarms and tensions. There's also a barely concealed fury in Congress that Democrats need their game faces with voters after the miserable debut of Obamacare.
