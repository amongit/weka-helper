In Washington even the inevitable can still come as a surprise. Such is the case with the resignation of Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, which President Barack Obama announced Monday.
He was, from the start, the wrong man for the job. In the U.S. Senate he was a relative dove among a generally hawkish GOP caucus. Obama wanted him because he would pursue the presidentâ€™s objectives, namely the downsizing of the U.S. military to its lowest levels since the period just before the onset of World War II and do it with zeal.
