So word has finally come out, so to speak: President Barack Obama was for gay marriage all along, and lied about it in 2008 to get to the White House, according to David Axelrod, his former political guru. The news comes a little under two years after he came out (so to speak) in favor of it â€“ and a day after seven of the nine justices all but raised a rainbow flag over the Supreme Court by allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in Alabama.
The reaction brought this famous scene from "Casablanca" to mind.
