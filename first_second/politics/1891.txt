Joy erupted Wednesday morning in Paris at the Young Democrats Abroad party at ritzy club, Palais Maillot, as the young voters celebrated President Barack Obama's successful re-election bid. By 2:30 am, the crowd had already thinned out and those brave enough to wait until the 5 am announcements, were pleasantly surprised, and more so, relieved.
Roopa Chauhan, 39, an American living in Paris said "I'm very happy. I was a little nervous at the beginning of the night. It's great to be surrounded by other Americans in Paris."
