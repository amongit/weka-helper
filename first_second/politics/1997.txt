The wave of voter suppression bills passed in the wake of the 2008 and 2010 general elections is now being answered with a wave of voting expansion bills. From online voter registration to preregistration for 16 and 17-year-olds to expanded options for early and absentee voting, state legislatures have been given a long menu of options for how to make American democracy work better in the 21st century, and to increase participation. Citing the historically low turnout levels for youth voting across the country in November 2014, some state legislators are taking steps to improve student voters' registration and voting options and to encourage them to exercise our democracy's most basic right.
The New Mexico Legislature is considering HB 252, a bill to designate colleges and universities as voter registration agencies under the National Voter Registration Act. There are pending bills in Tennessee and Texas to add to the list of accepted voter IDs a student ID card issued by an accredited postsecondary institution. (South Carolina is the only other strict voter ID state that excludes student ID cards. Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas, Georgia, Indiana and Virginia all accept student ID cards as voter ID.) Additionally, there are bills in a number of states, including Michigan and New Mexico, which will allow 16 and/or 17-year-olds to preregister and be automatically added to the rolls once they turn 18.
