Ku Klux Klan fliers are rattling a city in Washington state, after residents found the anti-Muslim propaganda thrown in their driveways last month.
“You can sleep tonight knowing the Klan is awake!” read the front of the fliers, while the back contained Islamophobic hate speech, according to the local NBC affiliate, KHQ-TV.
