The movie Selma has been praised as the first major movie on the history of the civil rights movement. Most critics agree that Selma is powerful and impressive, nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. But if there is one area where the movie disappoints, it is in drawing out the connection between the civil rights movement and religion. And if there's one thing we need to remember about Selma, it is precisely this dimly understood connection between liberal religion and social justice in America.
The storyline of the movie follows the civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, in February and March of 1965. It is an important history lesson worthy to be recalled, although as director Ava DuVernay maintains, Selma sometimes strays from the facts in service of a larger truth. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Martin Luther King, Jr., spearheaded three marches from Selma to Montgomery to demonstrate in favor of voting rights for African Americans. The campaign ended with King's speech at the Capitol building before a crowd of 25,000 people. While Selma has received some criticism for the way it construes President Lyndon B. Johnson's role as King's putative nemesis, the Selma campaign undoubtedly led to the signing of the Voting Rights Act in August 1965.
