Sitting, pen in hand, thinking about the depressing and disturbing events of recent months, and particularly the last couple of weeks, I tried to make sense of how I feel through the doodles and scribbles on my paper. As so many cartoonists have shown in the aftermath of the horrific Paris events, this medium can provide a powerful exposition of ideas and feelings, and a platform for intelligent and nuanced debate. But I wanted to break away from the overused duality of The Pen vs. The Gun which featured in so many of these responses.
