Hillary Clinton is Iowa-bound next month, making her first trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state since 2008 as she steps closer toward a decision on another White House bid.
Clinton, along with former President Bill Clinton, is scheduled to headline retiring Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, which has attracted potential Democratic presidential hopefuls for years.
