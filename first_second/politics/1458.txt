We are, by nature, storytellers. It is perhaps the single most distinguishing characteristic of Homo Sapiens. Lots of animals can communicate, but we can tell stories. According to historian Yuval Harari in his book Sapiens:
...The truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather it's the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all... fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.
