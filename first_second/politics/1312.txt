TGIF, the 16th day of 2015, and the second day of closed-door strategy sessions by Democrats and Republicans. President Barack Obama reportedly energized Democrats with his new assertiveness, while Republicans plan to blame Obama at every turn. It’s also the 102nd year since Congress began receiving State of the Union reports from their president; Obama continues the tradition in four days. And it’s the seventh year, minus one month, since then-GOP presidential also-ran Mitt Romney pulled the plug on his 2008 presidential campaign with a farewell speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference; some in his party apparently are hoping for a repeat performance when he addresses the Republican National Committee retreat in California today.
