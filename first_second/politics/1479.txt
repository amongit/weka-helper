Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito makes a habit (hope sharing this doesn't ruin it) of attending most years a special tribute dinner at George and Martha Washington's Mount Vernon -- some times on the lawn; other times in the newly built history center. The occasion is the presentation of the George Washington Book Prize, a $50,000 cash prize presented to the best book on America's founding era.
