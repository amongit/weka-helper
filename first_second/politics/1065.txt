NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. – Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference here, Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan told a story he thought delivered a stinging rebuke to the left and the welfare state. But he only put the lie to his own fundamental position on the social safety net.
Ryan told the story of a school kid who told an aide to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that he didn’t want a free school lunch, but rather a lunch of his own in a brown paper bag. “A kid with a brown paper bag has someone who cares for them,” Ryan relayed the child saying. The congressman went on: “People don’t want a life of comfort” but rather they want the satisfaction of earning something themselves – of work and ownership. “This is what the left doesn’t understand,” he told the approving crowd.
