"More than by fear of going astray, my hope is that we will be moved by the fear of remaining shut up within structures which give us a false sense of security, within rules which make us harsh judges, within habits which make us feel safe, while at our door people are starving." - Pope Francis
It's no secret many view Pope Francis as liberal and Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia as conservative. While Archbishop Chaput said such political labels are not useful and flawed, there's certainly a difference between the two men. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to describe Francis as a reformist and Chaput as a traditionalist.
