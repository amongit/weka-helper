After working on the 2008 Obama campaign, and celebrating his election, I've spent much of the past six years defending the president. Fortunately, the 2015 State-of-the-Union address found the president in fine form. Hopefully, this speech marks the return of the "good" Obama I expected.
Why has President Obama been so inconsistent? Some say it's the nature of his job. Being president of the United States means Obama has to juggle several hot items at once. Meanwhile the well-oiled Republican propaganda machine has conditioned its audience to receive one negative message each day: "ISIS is coming! Ebola is coming! The barbarians (immigrants) are at the gates!"
