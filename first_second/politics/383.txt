New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday lodged a complaint with the Election Commission (EC) against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal over the statements made by him over an advertisement published by it in newspapers.
Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal and BJP Delhi president Satish Upadhyay reached the EC's office after Kejriwal alleged that the BJP had insulted the whole 'Agrawal' caste in its advertisement. They complained to the EC saying Kejriwal was trying to give a casteist colour to the Delhi elections.
