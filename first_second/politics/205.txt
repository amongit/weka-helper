President Obama is "disappointed" by the latest allegations of U.S. Secret Service misconduct, but retains confidence in his new director, Joe Clancy, to lead an overhaul of the agency, a White House spokesman said today.
The president was informed earlier this week -- five days after the incident -- that two senior agents on his protective detail had allegedly driven while under the influence of alcohol, collided with a White House barricade and left the scene undisciplined, administration and Capitol Hill sources confirmed to ABC News. The agents, Mark Connolly and George Ogilvie, have been reassigned while the investigation is pending, according to Secret Service.
