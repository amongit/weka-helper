The Secret Service is trapped in a very unfortunate game of "But wait! There's more!" with The Washington Post.
The Post reports that two senior officers drove a government car into the White House security barricades on March 4. The officers, including an agent who is second-in-command on President Obama's security detail, were reportedly intoxicated and had left a retirement party for outgoing agency spokesman Ed Donovan.
