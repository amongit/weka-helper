(CNN)HERSHEY, PA. -- House and Senate Republicans piled into rent-a-buses to head from the nation's capital to the chocolate capital for a two-day retreat, with plans to work out a path forward for the new Congress on the budget, immigration and gossip about their favorite 2016 presidential picks over cocoa-flavored drinks.
Emboldened by a successful election cycle in 2014 in which the party bolstered its numbers in the House and took control of the Senate, the lawmakers — minus a few who decided to spend their time grooming possible future presidential campaigns elsewhere — huddled behind closed doors. The joint event was the first time both chambers have gathered together for an off-site retreat in ten years.
