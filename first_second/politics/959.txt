The release of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee’s report about the treatment of U.S. detainees captured in the war on terror was illuminating – illuminating in its illustration of the lengths to which certain partisans will go in their continuing efforts to get at former President George W. Bush and the Republicans.
The shock and awe expressed by those releasing the report is only exceeded by their duplicity. As has been reported time and again, senior members of the committee involved in its production were themselves briefed time and again between 2001 and 2007 on the techniques being used when questioning certain detainees with links to al-Qaida.
