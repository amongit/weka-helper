A German talk show host once asked comedian Robin Williams, “Why do you think there is not so much comedy in Germany?” Without missing a beat, Williams answered, “Did you ever think you killed all the funny people?” and then, as he told the story, immediately began looking for an exit.
What kind of a mind is it that is so quick, so developed that it could come up with such an answer and, at the same time, lack the internal discipline to understand that blurting it out might not be such a good idea? It is the result of a certain kind of manic genius that Robin Williams and few others possess and which, sadly, is now gone.
