Can we please leave "the American people" out of the debate over defunding the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare)? I'm not talking about the citizens of this great nation, but rather the politically self-righteous verbal tick our elected officials and commentators employ in an effort to invest in themselves the authority of the electorate.
So for example, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, the "defund" ringmaster, said earlier this week that while his grand idea has little chance in the Senate, "House Republicans must stand firm, hold their ground, and continue to listen to the American people." And on Fox News on Wednesday night, Cruz praised "House leadership for listening to the American people," adding that, "We've got to respond to the American people." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Cruz said, "needs to listen to" – you guessed it! – "the American people."
