President Barack Obama called it a "privilege" to swear in to his second term using a Bible that had been owned by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
But Obama didn't just swear in on the bible -- per the King family's request, he also inscribed the Bible, along with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who administered the presidential oath of office.
