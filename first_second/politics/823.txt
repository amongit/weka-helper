President Barack Obama showed a flair for comedy Thursday night when he mixed policy with a big dose of personality on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live."
It was the latest example of Obama's outreach to different groups of voters through various types of media, and it displayed the president as a down-to-earth fellow who can take a joke, even at his own expense.
