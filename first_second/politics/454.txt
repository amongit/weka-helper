WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is stepping away from the heated debate over government funding and his health care law to raise campaign cash for Democrats.
Democratic officials say about 25 people are expected at the Jefferson Hotel, a few blocks from the White House. Tickets cost up to $32,400 and benefit the Democratic National Committee, which is still retiring debt from Obama's re-election.
