Canada's Veterans Affairs Minister Erin O'Toole earned some praise this week from former soldiers after he rolled out a batch of promises, as the Conservatives try to address veterans' complaints.
Last fall, then veterans affairs minister Julian Fantino faced opposition calls for his resignation or firing over his handling of the veterans portfolio. The department had faced heated criticism from veterans over the decision to close regional offices and for the lack of support for veterans with mental illness.
