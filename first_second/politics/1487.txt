A new group is pushing for changes in the 2016 general election debates, according to Politico.
Top officials from past campaigns -- including Anita Dunn and Beth Myers, former debate-prep advisers for President Barack Obama and his opponent Mitt Romney -- make up the group, which is being sponsored by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
