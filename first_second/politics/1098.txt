Memo to House Republicans eyeing a deficit-and-debt exit from the current government shutdown: The radical right isn't going to give up its bone so easily.
The government shut down, remember, because House Republicans – spurred on by outside agitators like Heritage Action and RedState's Erick Erickson – refused to fund the government unless President Obama and the Senate agreed to defund Obamacare. It wasn't a fight the GOP leadership wanted. They preferred – and still prefer – to use the frame of a debt ceiling fight to push their spending cut agenda, which is why in the days since the government shuttered, we've heard less and less about Obamacare and more and more about the deficit and the debt.
