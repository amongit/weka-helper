Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama made his first public statement on the recent attack on police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, Thursday night, saying that despite the issues in the town, there was "no excuse for criminal acts."
"I think that what had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts," Obama said, in a sober moment during a largely light-hearted appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"
