Good morning class. It's the first Monday in October, and under the bright sun, you can feel the rustle of autumn leaves by the Supreme Court, which traditionally opens for business today. Do you hear the jubilant cheers from that direction? That's because the court did something right by five states in the country. Chief Justice John Roberts and the rest of the eight Justices declined to take a second look at lower court rulings that allowed same-sex marriages to go forward. That means a green light for a new frontier for human rights.
So in Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, Utah and Oklahoma, you can now dance at a gay marriage – be merry and gay, so to speak. Pour the champagne and celebrate like crazy. In these five states, such marriages were on ice, depending on what the court decided to do – or not do.
