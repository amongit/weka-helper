I referenced earlier House GOP Florida Rep. Ted Yoho's weird assertion on CNN yesterday that U.S. creditors will feel better if we hit the debt ceiling, but it's worth circling back to the appearance to correct some more of the misleading gibberish he spouted.
Yoho is a rising member of the default-deniers caucus â€“ people who argue that it really wouldn't be so bad if today passes without the U.S. raising the debt ceiling. " A lot of this is media hype," he told CNN's Jake Tapper, citing as evidence what he claimed to be previous instances where we survived hitting the debt ceiling.
