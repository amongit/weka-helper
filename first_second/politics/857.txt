Despite all the ballyhoo, the State of the Union address leaves President Barack Obama in the same difficult spot he was in before giving the speech: He still faces stubborn opposition from majority Republicans in Congress that will make approval of his agenda highly unlikely.
As a result, Obama is left with a three-pronged strategy for his remaining two years in office: bypassing Congress with unilateral actions to carry out his policies; using his veto on legislation when he believes the GOP goes too far, and attempting to frame the 2016 election in ways that make the Republicans look out of touch.
