The Obama administration has revamped its health care leadership and poured millions of dollars into improving the website it created for Americans to shop for government-subsidized heath plans, but a new survey shows most people still think shopping for health insurance is just as bad or worse than doing their taxes or getting a cavity filled.
The results come from the Health Insurance Pulse Survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates and released Tuesday by Bankrate.com, a personal finance publisher. Findings included health insurance spending preferences by age and income, as well as Americans' feelings on health insurance reform.
