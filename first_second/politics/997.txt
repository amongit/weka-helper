That President Barack Obama would pick the evening of Sept. 10 to give a major address to the nation in which he outlined his strategy for dealing with the Islamic State and the reign of terror it has brought to a section of the Middle East is not without irony.
As Americans, we once again face the prospect of U.S. troops being inserted – or in this case reinserted – into the region. We want to support the president, we want to rally to his side and be, as we were in the days after the 9/11 attack on New York and Washington, one nation in as much as it is possible for more than 300 million people to be. Regrettably, Obama’s actions over the last few years have made that difficult.
