Earlier this year the U.S. Senate voted 98-1 that "[c]limate change is real and not a hoax." That vote did not comfort many liberals, though, because only a third of Republicans (as opposed to two thirds of Democrats) think that human activity is causing climate change. Indeed, 42 percent of Republicans think that the climate is warming due to natural causes.
Faced with this chasm in beliefs, what should those who want serious action to address global warming do? Opponents of such action are not uneducated fools. Many are skilled at finding research and opinions that support their view. Confronting them with scientific "proof" of the human causes of climate change seems only to strengthen their resistance.
