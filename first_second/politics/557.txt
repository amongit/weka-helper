Among the events that have marked a new year full of optimism and undoubted importance in global history, is the restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, which will set a common agenda between the two countries, leading to a dismantling of a system of sanctions applied to Cuba for more than 50 years. It is also an unprecedented development opportunity for the island.
Latin American leaders greeted with surprise and excitement the resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. In fact, this was manifested by the presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, among others, through various opinions expressed in the media and at the summit of MERCOSUR held in Parana, Argentina, the day of the announcement. The advance of Obama and Castro reveals the will of the United States to mend relations with Latin America. Removing one of the main causes of tension in relations with Latin American states -- most of which viewed with disapproval the embargo and sanctions imposed on the island -- is a smart move to open the door to a new era of relations in all areas.
