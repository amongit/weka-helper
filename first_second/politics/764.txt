Here's how I picture Jeb Bush, with his father George and his big brother George, huddled around a boiling cauldron: "When shall we three meet again?/in Florida, Texas or in Maine?"
Any resemblance to the Macbeth witches in thunder, lightning or rain is, of course, intentional. The Washington buzz that Jeb Bush will follow in his brother's and his father's footsteps in running for president is a bit scary for democracy. They are not done with us yet. Good and bad things come in threes.
