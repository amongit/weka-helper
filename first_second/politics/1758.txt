"Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?" --Thomas Jefferson in his First Inaugural Address
It all worked out beautifully, and the way it was structured made it absolutely clear that the House of Representatives was not acting out of self-interest when it finally decided to fund Homeland Security and put an end to end the stalemate that threatened to defund Homeland Security, an action that would have put the whole country at risk of all manner of bad things from which it is protected by that agency. Members of Congress were acting in the best interests of the entire country, which is exactly what we have come to expect from our elected representatives. It also became obvious why it did what it did.
