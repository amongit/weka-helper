I voted early last week. I waited three hours in the sun. When I finally got to the voting booth I spent another 25 minutes on the ballot even with two cheat sheets for amendments and questions. The amendments, questions and local candidates were confusing, but who to vote for in the presidential election wasn't. I voted Obama. Sure, each candidate has his positives and negatives. Most polls say Romney took the first debate and Obama won the second two. Throughout the debates and campaign season both gave supporters plenty to be proud of and plenty of fodder for the other side. We had Big Bird, binders, bayonets and some pesky economic numbers. After fact-checking and digging into campaign points and arguments, usually both had validity, it just depended which data they chose to use.
It comes down to individual choice on what is important, what drives me, what scares me and what inspires me.
