(CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush broke from the potential Republican 2016 pack Friday in New Hampshire when instead of an eager endorsement, he said the Republican senators signed their controversial letter to Iran "out of frustration."
"There's been no dialogue, no conversation, there's been a stifling of debate about the properness of this negotiation," Bush said.
