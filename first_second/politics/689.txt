Following the release of American Alan Gross from Cuban prisons, it's likely tension between the United States and Cuba will relax, which could pave the way for trade, travel and yes, more cigars.
Many Cubans already live in the U.S. as refugees. The U.S. is the primary destination for migrants from Cuba, with over a million people born in Cuba living in the country. Spain and Italy follow far behind, with 120,000 Cubans living in Spain and 30,000 in Italy, according to data from Pew Research Center.
