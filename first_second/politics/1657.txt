WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Democrats still don't have a city for their 2016 presidential nominating convention, but they now have dates.
The Democratic National Committee on Friday said their convention would take place the week of July 25, 2016. It comes right after Republicans plan to have their convention in Cleveland the week before.
