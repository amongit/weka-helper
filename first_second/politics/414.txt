The origin of the problem that plagued Republican pollsters in 2012 (and to a lesser extent Democratic pollsters in 2010 and Republicans in 2008) is that we're really good at what has historically been the big question we've been asked to answer: How are people going to vote?
But the "dirty secret" in political polling is that neither Republican nor Democratic pollsters historically have worked much at measuring who will vote. In fact, it is standard practice among campaign pollsters and many media pollsters to impose a model of what the electorate will look like on a sample via either weighting or stratification.
