I remember it like it was yesterday. It was 2011 and I was sitting on the steps of the capital building in Madison, Wisconsin, watching history unfold. Governor Scott Walker exhibited world-class mental toughness as he took on the teacher's unions, and thousands of angry protestors. And today, Walker does it again, this time signing a bill that makes Wisconsin the 25th state to ban contracts that force all workers to pay union dues.
Governor Walker said, "This freedom-to-work legislation will give workers the freedom to choose whether or not they want to join a union, and employers another compelling reason to consider expanding or moving their business to Wisconsin."
