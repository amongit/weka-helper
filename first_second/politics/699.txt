For the first time in more than two decades, Americans have said gun rights are more important than gun control, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. The survey comes on the heels of the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and follows an upward trend for mass shootings in the U.S.
In the survey, 52 percent of respondents said it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns, and 46 percent said controlling gun ownership was more important.
