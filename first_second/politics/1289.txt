Happy TGIF, the 30th day of the year and nearly the 27th month since President Barack Obama defeated Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to win a second term in office. There were flashes of that hotly contested race when a fired-up, ready-to-go Obama addressed congressional Democrats Thursday evening in Philadelphia, reminding them to stand up for their accomplishments – health care, the economy and other stuff – and taking a poke at Romney, who’s pondering a third presidential run; more on that later. Meanwhile, it’s a decision day of sorts for Romney 3.0, who’ll discuss his intentions (after mixed reviews on his reboot) on a mid-morning conference call with supporters, then attend a private charity lunch with, of all people, Hillary Clinton’s daughter in New York.
