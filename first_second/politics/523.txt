It was supposed to be a busy week for Hillary's roll out towards her 2016 campaign. March 8 was International Women's Day. March 9 was the unveiling of the Clinton "No Ceilings" report. March 10 was meant to be Hillary reminding us all of her "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights" speech in 1995 in Beijing at the UN. Instead, all the media wanted to talk about was her email.
But this past week was also about Selma, Alabama and the 50-year anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the day that mainly Black civil rights activists were beaten crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge fighting for the right to vote. Lots of new activists from Black Lives Matter were there to commemorate the day, as was Michael Brown's mother, representing her murdered unarmed son, shot by a white police officer.
