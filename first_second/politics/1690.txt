Anyone who doubts Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's drive and ability to wield power unhindered by any sense of fair play in pursuit of plutocratic ends should read Allen Raymond's 2008 book titled: How To Rig An Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative. Raymond recounts his career as a political hatchet man for the GOP. And even as aggressive and merciless the young Raymond was as a Republican operative, he notes that Mitch McConnell's oily demeanor still scared the shit out of him.
Raymond is a rich white Republican guy with an illustrious New England pedigree who had dedicated his youth to getting other rich white Republican guys elected to office. He gained brief notoriety following the 2002 midterm elections for being at the center of a criminal enterprise that jammed the phone lines of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, which ultimately earned him a three-month stint in a federal pen.
