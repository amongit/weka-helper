A few years ago, my beloved child was kidnapped by a cult, which made a monster out of innocence. I was deprived from mourning this loss, showing off cute childhood pictures and flaunting my love. I did not dare express my tears in bright sunlight, and could not wait to hide an erupting volcano of tears in the darkness of the night.
Everyone blamed me, from pediatricians to teachers for raising a monster. All around me, stares spoke paragraphs of blame: there must have been parental neglect, passing of some corrupted genes, perhaps even purchasing toys with the wrong themes. On top of imprisoning my tears so I am not ever caught mourning, I was chained by enormous guilt.
