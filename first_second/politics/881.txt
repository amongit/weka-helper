President Barack Obama combined forces with opposition Republicans to win a narrow budget victory in the House of Representatives Thursday night, but it came at a high political cost because he alienated many liberals who opposed parts of measure.
White House aides said Obama made several last-minute phone calls to persuade wavering fellow Democrats to support the legislation. The $1.1 trillion spending package passed the Republican-controlled House on a vote of 219-206 with fewer than three hours to go until government funding expired. The measure now goes to the Senate, where its fate is unclear.
