President Barack Obama will appear at two fundraisers on Wednesday night in his hometown of Chicago to raise money for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. This is the third time the president has appeared at fundraisers for the campaign arm of the House Democrats as they seek to reclaim control of the chamber from the Republican majority in 2014.
One event will be held at the Downtown Hilton just off of Lake Michigan, and another will be held at the home of Bettylu and Paul Saltzman, major Democratic donors and longtime patrons of the president.
