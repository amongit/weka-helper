If the world’s billionaires got together to form their own super country, their $7.05 trillion combined net worth would be eclipsed only by the national economic output of China and the United States.
Forbes on Monday issued its 29th annual who’s-who list of the world’s wealthiest, and this year a record 1,826 people with at least a $1 billion fortune made the cut. Bill Gates, with the help of his $79.2 billion net worth, took home the title of world’s wealthiest man for the 16th time in the last 21 years.
