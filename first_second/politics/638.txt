More American students are graduating from high school than ever before, according to new data from the Department of Education.
The national graduation rate hit a record high of 81 percent in the 2012-13 school year, the data show. Since 2010, states have been using a uniform method of calculating graduation rates called the adjusted cohort graduation rate, which measures the number of students from an original cohort who graduated in four years with a diploma. The calculation adds students who transfer into the cohort and subtracts those who transfer out (to another state or country) or die. Before, states had varying methods for calculating graduation rates.
