If you are dreaming of a white Christmas, depending on where you are, Santa could bring snow. Based on historical records for snow on the ground from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the map shows the probability of having at least one inch of snow on the ground.
It isn't a weather forecast. This year will actually have unusually low snow for Christmas, according to The Washington Post.
