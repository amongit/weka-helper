After a record surge between 2011 and 2013, the number of abortion restrictions passed by state legislatures leveled off in 2014. However, supporters of a woman’s right to an abortion have reason to worry that the relative slowdown in state abortion restrictions won’t last long.
In 2014, 15 states enacted 26 new abortion restrictions, according to a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy analysis organization that supports abortion access. That's down from the 70 measures enacted in 2013. The report notes that many states have shortened lawmaking sessions in even-numbered years and that legislatures in four states – including North Dakota and Texas, where lawmakers tend to be among the toughest on abortion access – were not even in session in 2014.
