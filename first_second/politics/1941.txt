I am a Columbia University undergraduate, and a proud American Democrat, but I've spent the past year at Oxford. In October, I joined the Oxford student Labour Club, to learn how my British peers approach grassroots activism. The answer: with a surprising amount of efficiency. In a country that many Americans associate with endless NHS waiting lines, and sluggish bureaucracy, local election campaigns are well-oiled machines.
At 5 a.m. on election day, I gathered with a crowd of over 100 Oxford University students and the local Labour MP Andrew Smith to make a final push for a Labour party victory. Things weren't looking good. The candidate, who has held office for the past 13 years, was expected to lose by at least 700 votes.
