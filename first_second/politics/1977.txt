During his campaign swing through Washington, DC this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave two speeches. He delivered the second before a joint session of Congress and, predictably, denounced the negotiations currently going on between the United States and Iran. A "bad deal" he intoned as Republican congressmen applauded. If things don't work out for Netanyahu in his own election two weeks from now, look for him to be floated as a possible running-mate for Scott Walker.
But it was in his first speech, the one before the AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) the day before, that Netanyahu let loose."For 2000 years," Netanyahu told the cheering AIPAC crowd, "my people, the Jewish people, were stateless, defenseless, voiceless. We were utterly powerless against our enemies who swore to destroy us. We suffered relentless persecution and horrific attacks. We could never speak on our own behalf, and we could not defend ourselves." No more, no more, Netanyahu assured the gathering, "The days when the Jewish people are passive in the face of threats to annihilate us, those days are over."
