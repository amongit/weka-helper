The political atmosphere in Washington is deteriorating. Again.
The latest flashpoint was an open letter from 47 Republican senators warning leaders of Iran that any nuclear deal they make with President Barack Obama could be voided immediately by Obama’s successor. White House officials cried foul. They denounced the letter as an attempt to undermine Obama’s negotiations with Tehran and represented a “rush to war.” Vice President Joe Biden, a former Democratic senator from Delaware, seethed. In a statement to reporters, he said, “In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country – much less a longtime foreign adversary – that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them. …The decision to undercut our president and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle.”
