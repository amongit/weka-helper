Walter Isaacson, the eminent biographer, gave a dazzling public talk, the 43rd Jefferson Lecture, at the Kennedy Center last night. He seamlessly connected the creative arts and technology, just as his book subjects Benjamin Franklin, Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein did in their breakthroughs. He spoke fondly of the Southern writer he knew and admired, novelist Walker Percy, who walked right up to the edge of practicing medicine.
Almost as a surprise party for the 2,000 people in the concert hall, he related that Lord Byron's daughter, Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, was a math genius who wrote the first computer program of sorts during the Industrial Revolution. Who knew? I mean, really. At times history is what they never told you, as we shall see with Francis Scott Key.
