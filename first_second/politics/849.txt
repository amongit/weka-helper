With the exit of Mitt Romney from the 2016 presidential race, the two best-positioned remaining potential candidates, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, face similar problems as establishment leaders during a time of political ferment.
If they run, as expected, they will be prime targets for everyone else in the campaign and for the news media. They will need to reassure zealous factions in their parties that prefer more ideologically pure nominees. For Clinton, the biggest threat to her winning the Democratic nomination probably comes from the left. For Bush, the threat for the Republican nomination probably comes from the right. Both of them also will be called upon to explain why their experience, their family ties and their connections to the political establishment should outweigh the desire of many voters for new blood and fresh faces.
