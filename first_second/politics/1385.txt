Fifty years ago, on August 10, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed what is known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. It is a day that should live in infamy.
On that day, the president gave himself the power "to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed forces," to fight the spread of communism in Southeast Asia and assist our ally in South Vietnam "in defense of its freedom."
