DES MOINES, Iowa -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declined to support a federal standard that requires U.S. transportation fuels to use a minimum amount of renewable fuels like ethanol, a multibillion dollar industry in the state that kicks off the presidential campaign.
Bush and Cruz revealed their positions Saturday at an agriculture summit convened by Bruce Rastetter, a wealthy Republican campaign contributor and fierce advocate for the renewable fuel standard.
