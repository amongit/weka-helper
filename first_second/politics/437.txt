Barack Obama is now the face of the United States -- the photograph we will see when we go through customs at JFK airport, or when we go to any U.S. Embassy on earth. The impact of this image, particularly at first, will be subtle, but immeasurable and its iconographic significance is multi-layered. He might refer to himself self-deprecatingly as a "mutt," but he is in effect, Globalized Man. With parts coming from all around the earth, including Africa and Ireland, passing through Asia on the way back to America, our new President now seems inevitable -- this is the way the world is in 2008. But perhaps of even larger importance is that the leader of the world's greatest democracy was a professor of constitutional law and above all, a teacher. The Constitution -- as in, the foundation of any functioning democracy -- is his area of expertise. As such, he embodies the best possible advertisement for democracy at a time when the world needs it most and our country could benefit from, as Bill Clinton put it, the "power of example" rather than the "example of power."
Even though there are differing standards of classification for what makes a democracy, it always means rule of the people -- free and fair elections, elected representatives and freedom of all expression. But it is rule of law as provided by the Constitution which is democracy's sine qua non, and which depending on your interpretation, is either a precondition for, or is strengthened by, democracy. In the U.S., it is the Constitution that provides our basic civil liberties and political rights, allowing us, among many other things, religious freedom, due process, a guarantee that the power of the federal government is not absolute, and the clear delineation of three branches of government.
