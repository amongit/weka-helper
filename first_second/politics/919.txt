President Obama may not be welcome to campaign for vulnerable Democrats in competitive states but he remains a big hit on the fundraising circuit.
Obama has attended 55 fundraising events so far this year, including events Tuesday in New York City and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps track of such data. Democratic officials haven't yet disclosed how much Obama has raised for his party in 2014 but it's clear that the total has been many millions of dollars. He is scheduled to visit the home of actress Gwyneth Paltrow in Los Angeles Thursday for still another fundraiser. Tickets cost up to $32,400 per person.
