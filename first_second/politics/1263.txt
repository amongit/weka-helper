War is Heck: He swept into office in 2008 as the guy who spoke out against the Iraq invasion, opposing “dumb wars” and vowing to end the ones we were already in at the time.

Forty percent of the public said they’ll remember him for ending war, 44 percent said he’ll be the guy who started a new one, and a slight majority say he should get the power he needs to go after Islamic State group in Iraq and Afghanistan, irony be damned. Given how they feel about the “blank check” they say he’s asking for, it’s a good thing the pollsters didn’t ask Democrats in the Senate.
