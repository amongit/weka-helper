Hoping to reassure fearful Americans, President Barack Obama has ordered "much more aggressive" monitoring of the spread of Ebola in the United States and said the public should be confident in the government's ability to prevent an epidemic of the lethal virus.
Obama met for two hours with senior advisers Wednesday to discuss the administration's response to the Ebola threat, postponing a fundraiser in New Jersey and a campaign rally in Connecticut. He pledged that a review of the much-publicized Ebola cases in Dallas would determine why two nurses were infected with the disease after they participated in the care of a Liberian man who eventually died of the virus.
