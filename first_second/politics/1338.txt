Al Gore has alleged that Al Jazeera is wrongfully withholding millions of dollars from him because of "financially disastrous" decisions the network has made.
The former vice president and co-founder of Current TV sued Al Jazeera earlier this month, accusing the network of owing him money from the sale of his channel in 2013. Al Jazeera denied the allegations, saying that the money in dispute had actually been set aside in escrow in case the network had to fight legal charges over issues that arose during Current TV's existence.
