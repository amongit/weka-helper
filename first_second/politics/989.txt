With everything else going on in the world, President Barack Obama’s now-infamous “latte salute” to his official Marine guard, delivered coffee cup in hand, didn’t seem worthy of comment.
It’s a small thing, perhaps indicative of his true feelings about the military or his lack of concern for protocol, perhaps not – but not really the kind of thing that should inspire a robust debate among Americans of good will, especially at a time when Christians are being beheaded in the Middle East by the Islamic State group and U.S. troops are being put in harm’s way to try and stop it. There’s so much else going on in the country and the world that is important that one clumsily delivered salute shouldn’t have generated much more than a “what do you expect?” kind of shrug from people who didn’t like it.
