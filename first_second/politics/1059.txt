Today is O-Day, the last day of enrollment for new health insurance policies under Obamacare (more or less) and the key numbers to watch are seven and 9.5 – with million appended to both. In both cases, Democrats finally have some good news to relish about the embattled Affordable Care Act.
Seven million was the benchmark enrollment figure originally put out there by the Congressional Budget Office, later revised down to 6 million. But with the law having blown past the 6 million figure last Thursday and with the healthcare.gov website having fielded 2 million visits this weekend alone, there’s at least “an outside chance,” as Obamacare stats guru Charles Gaba notes today on ACASignups.net, that the 7 million threshold could be reached by day’s end. That would be an astonishing turnaround after the dismal website roll-out and could at least temporarily change the narrative surrounding the law as the media focuses more on success stories than glitches and website blackouts (of which more in a moment).
