Plato boiled political evolution down to a sequence of monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, and dictatorship. There are many illustrations of the sequence in history -- not least in the French Revolution, and what is happening in Russia today. At the same time, democracy seems to be under strain in the United States, the United (for the moment) Kingdom, and in South Africa, not to mention the European Union, where unelected bureaucrats and central bankers are dictating policy to Greece, Spain, and Portugal in a way that negates democracy.
Is democracy forever, or could it be near a tipping point where the number of truly democratic countries -- on the rise since the eighteenth century -- starts to go into reverse?
