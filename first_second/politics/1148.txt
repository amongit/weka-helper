Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, all but closed the door on another presidential run Friday after weeks of moves telegraphing he was poised to wage a third consecutive bid.
“After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the Party the opportunity to become our next nominee,” Romney told supporters, according to a statement obtained by conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.
