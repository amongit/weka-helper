Welcome to Thursday, the 71st day of the year and the eighth day since Attorney General Eric Holder issued a report detailing systemic, abusive racism within the Ferguson, Missouri, civic structure, including its police department and court system. Protesters upset at the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teenager last August were skeptical a Justice Department investigation would get results since the white cop who shot the teen wasn’t charged. But Holder’s unflinching report hit like a Floyd Mayweather uppercut: several top officials, including Ferguson’s police chief and city manager, got the boot, the start of what’s likely to be a thorough civic housecleaning. Now, however, the city is reeling after two local police officers were shot and seriously wounded during protests there early Thursday, undermining months-long protests, empowering Holder’s critics and destabilizing his moves to dismantle a corrupt system.
