It’s curious that President Barack Obama announced he wanted the Federal Communications Commission to classify the Internet as a public utility while he was in China. Though the “Bamboo Curtain” may in many respects be down, it’s still very much in place where the free flow of information – especially information critical of the government and the ruling Communist Party is concerned.
Obama may have in mind the eventual adoption of the Chinese model of Internet governance, which may also explain his administration’s continued campaign to severe the last remaining ties between the U.S. government – which, after all, created the Internet and shared it with the world – and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a U.S. chartered non-profit entity based in California charged with making most of the essential decisions about the governance of the World Wide Web.
