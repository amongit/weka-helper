The second open enrollment for plans on the health insurance marketplace mandated under the Affordable Care Act began in November. Americans have until Dec. 15 to sign up for plans that would begin on Jan. 1 and open enrollment ends on Feb. 15, 2015.
Those who signed up last year were satisfied overall with their coverage, according to a recent Gallup poll. Three-fourths said they were satisfied with the cost of coverage, but will they be as happy this year?
