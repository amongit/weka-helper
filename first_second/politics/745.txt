The Shakespeare's Globe grand tour starts here in Washington, D.C. Catch the wind at the Folger Theatre, where you'll see the "King Lear" of your life. Yes, this is like a 100-year event on the arts floodplain. It's William Shakespeare's 400th birthday year, and to celebrate the Bard properly, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London is sending players around the globe, so to speak, to perform a Shakespearean play in every country in the world.
Is that not lofty, even noble?
