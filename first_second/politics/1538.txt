Clint Eastwood spoke to his local paper following his much-discussed speech last Thursday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa and revealed that he thought of talking to an imaginary President Barack Obama in an empty chair while sitting in the green room before his speech.
"There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I wanted to sit down," he told the Carmel Pine Cone. “When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea. I’ll just put the stool out there and I’ll talk to Mr. Obama and ask him why he didn’t keep all of the promises he made to everybody."
