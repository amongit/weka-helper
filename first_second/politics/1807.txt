On January 14, 2015, the Pew Research Center released a report on Women and Leadership. It is full of both good news and bad news about women's progress, as summed up in the report's subtitle, "Public Says Women are Equally Qualified, but Barriers Persist." It explores public attitudes about gender and leadership with a particular focus on leadership in U.S. politics and business. The report illuminates differences in attitudes among four generations of adults and gives us some clues as to the work that needs to be done to reach the Vision 2020 goal of increasing women in senior leadership positions.
According to the study, about 40 percent of Americans believe that women continue to face a double standard in seeking leadership positions in both politics and business with women having to meet higher standards of performance. A similar number of people feel that the electorate and corporate America are just not ready to accept more women in top leadership.
