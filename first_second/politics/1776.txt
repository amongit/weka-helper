This week we once again came back from the brink of congressional implosion and consequent government shutdown. On March 3, after weeks of threats, hyperbole, petty tantrums, and partisan bickering, the House of Representatives voted 257 to 167 to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the end of the fiscal year 2015. DHS was mere hours away from running out of money and being forced to shut down.
It is truly stunning to witness the lengths that Congressional Republican extremists are willing to go to achieve their aims. At a time of heightened security tensions at home and across the world, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives tip-toed to the brink of letting DHS funding run out simply because they couldn't stand to see the president exercise his lawful authority on immigration enforcement policy.
