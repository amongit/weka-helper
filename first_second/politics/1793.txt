I was at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts when President Obama announced on December 17 that he would be charting a new course on Cuba. Just before he was scheduled to speak, I rushed down to the canteen where Kennedy Center employees lunch, and walked right up to the flat screen television mounted to the wall, sitting directly in front of it because the volume was unbearably low and the cashier informed me that she had no way of changing it.
No way of changing it? This is Cuba, I thought. Kennedy-era Cuba!
