If 2011 was the year of the 99%, 2012 was all about the 47%. Once the video of Mitt Romney dismissing just under half of the country leaked, that number would prove to haunt the rest of his short political career. Not only did Romney end up winning just 47% of the popular vote, but as of this week it's also his post-election approval rating.
So it only seemed fitting to look back at the 47 funniest political videos of the year. From the best political bits on late night, to web videos by Funny or Die, The Onion and other lesser-known producers, to a few unintentionally hilarious moments from the politicians themselves, 2012 was a great year to laugh at politics in America.
