A week of barnstorming that leads up to Tuesday's midterm election has become a humbling journey for President Obama.
He has been raising millions of dollars for the Democratic party but he is being shunned by many fellow party members in races for Congress. These candidates are discouraged by Obama's lowly poll numbers; only about 41 percent of voters approve of his job performance, according to Gallup. And many candidates have decided not to ask him to campaign for them in the finale of the campaign season. In fact, vulnerable Democratic candidates for the Senate are trying to distance themselves from their party leader in many states, including Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire and North Carolina.
