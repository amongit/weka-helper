The streets of Selma, Alabama, were packed on Saturday with thousands of people who traveled to the small town to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic march for voting rights.
Large crowds gathered around the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which marks the location where local activists, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were attacked by police on March 7, 1965. Officers used tear gas and billy cubs to subdue the marchers, and the day later came to be known as "Bloody Sunday."
