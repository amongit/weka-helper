President Bill Clinton enjoyed telling his speechwriters when they gathered in the Oval: "I used to give three speeches a day." The not-so-subtle message: He didn't need speechwriters. High-flown Woodrow Wilson, the last president to write his own speeches, lived and breathed in the White House one hundred years ago. Thus presidential speechwriters have been a fact of Washington political life for roughly a century. Since Peggy Noonan popularized her tale of what she saw at the Reagan Revolution, it's become one of the coolest jobs going. On the other coast, it's roughly akin to being a screenwriter on a dark cable drama, writing lines, scenes and backstory for the talent. And since so many of those shows are set in Washington, the special relationship with Hollywood is only getting closer. The distance between screenwriters and speechwriters may be narrowing as well.
In real life Washington, we have come to see the presidency as performance art since Ronald Reagan played the role so convincingly.
