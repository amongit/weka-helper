BOWIE, Md. -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) renewed his call for criminal justice reform in a wide-ranging speech Friday at Bowie State University, a historically black college in Maryland. Addressing students, local leaders, and activists as part of his minority outreach effort, Paul stressed the need to roll back civil asset forfeiture and mandatory minimum sentencing laws ahead of a likely bid for president in 2016.
"If weâ€™re for families with a mother and father around, we need to be for fixing the criminal justice system," he said, framing reform as an economic issue of interest to all Republicans.
