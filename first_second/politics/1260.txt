Happy Hump Day, the 48th day of 2015 and the 12th year since former President George W. Bush ordered U.S. troops to spearhead an invasion of Iraq, toppling despotic President Saddam Hussein but destabilizing a relatively stable region, and creating the petri dish in which Islamic State group germinated. President Barack Obama convenes a three-day White House summit aimed at countering Islamic State’s recruitment of U.S. citizens and other forms of domestic violent extremism, a problem that’s the latest long-term national security threat. It’s also the day Jeb Bush, the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender, unveils his view of the world with a big speech in Obama’s hometown, written with input from members of his big brother’s national security team (see below) – further proof, as if we need it, that the universe loves irony.

That’s just days after a North Carolina man murdered three Muslim-American University of North Carolina students, an act that’s being investigated as a hate crime.
