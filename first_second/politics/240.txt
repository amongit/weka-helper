Starbucks has 21 coffee shops in Berlin. It has 50 locations in London. In the last three months of 2014, its European and Middle Eastern sales generated $333 million in revenue. The coffee giant prides itself on being a global entity with a distinct American identity. But like other U.S. multinational corporations, Starbucks suffers from a uniquely American phenomenon: the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world.
U.S. companies pay almost 40 percent in taxes on all earnings, whether the money is made stateside or overseas. This puts them at a severe disadvantage in foreign markets. For example, Starbucks rival Costa Coffee is a British company subject to the United Kingdom's much lower corporate tax rate of 20 percent. Right out of the gate, the Costa Coffee at 200 Piccadilly in London shoulders only about half the tax burden of the Starbucks coffeehouse one-fifth of a mile away, at 171 Piccadilly. Under U.S. tax law, Starbucks pays U.K. taxes first and gets a U.S. tax credit for that amount. Then it pays the additional amount it owes in U.S. taxes, reaching nearly 40 percent.
