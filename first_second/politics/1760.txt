The following is adapted from a speech delivered by U.S. Rep. Luis V. Guti√©rrez on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, March 4, 2015.
I would like to congratulate the speaker and the Republican majority for coming to their senses and allowing the House of Representatives to pass a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security for the rest of the fiscal year.
