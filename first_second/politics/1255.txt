Three Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon):
Question Time: After two highly-publicized speeches that got meh reviews – both of which were followed by Q-and-A sessions where he really shined – Jeb Bush has made an obvious tactical decision to ditch a speech for a moderated discussion at next week’s Conservative Political Action Committee confab here in Washington. Though he’s only going for 20 minutes or so, it’s no small risk for The Smart One: The hardcore conservatives who attend CPAC think he’s a RINO (Republican In Name Only) who’s a cheerleader for Common Core (which they hate), who’s for sensible immigration reform (which they’re not) and who committed conservative heresy by suggesting that they shouldn’t be pandered to in the Republican primary (did he learn nothing from Jon Huntsman??), even if it means losing a race or two. They probably won’t greet him with pitchforks and flaming torches – emphasis on “probably” – but they’ll almost certainly turn up the heat, perhaps the first uncomfortable room Bush has faced since returning to the political arena. And it will be interesting to see what he’ll serve up from his “different Republican” cookbook to an audience whose very existence depends on a steady diet of red meat.
