Two men whose car was rear-ended last year by the chief of staff to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are suing both the congressman and his top aide for negligence, according to Legal Times.
The driver, Santos Perez, and his passenger, Adan Cajas, are seeking $100,000 in damages from Ryan and his chief of staff, Kevin Seifert, for the February 2014 accident, NBC Washington reported. Seifert was driving the vehicle along I-395 in Washington when the accident happened. The lawsuit argues that he failed to keep a safe distance and failed to drive at a safe speed. It also asserts that Perez and Cajas suffered injuries in the crash.
