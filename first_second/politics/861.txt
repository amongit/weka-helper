Day after day, week after week, President Barack Obama has been delivering his State of the Union address in dribs and drabs. Taken together, his actions and promises amount to a manifesto that he will aggressively push an activist agenda during his remaining two years in office.
He told Senate Democrats at a private retreat Thursday that he will continue to take unilateral actions to bypass the Republican majority in Congress and will veto legislation that would block his agenda. "I'm not going to spend the next two years on defense; I'm going to pay offense," Obama said, according to Politico.
