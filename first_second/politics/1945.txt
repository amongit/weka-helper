LONDON — Britain's messy, unresolved election may have created the conditions for fundamental change of a voting system that has inspired democracies from the United States to India.
The first-place Conservatives are negotiating with the Liberal Democrats in the hope of getting a majority in parliament. That gives the third-place party hope they now have enough leverage to introduce a change that would alter the face of British politics – potentially sweeping away the two-party system in favor of a European model in which coalitions are the order of the day.
