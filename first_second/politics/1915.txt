Republicans are constantly complaining that President Obama apologizes for this country. What is becoming more and more apparent is that there is a lot to apologize for -- particularly Republicans. While Republicans like to talk about American exceptionalism, the sentiment behind that statement is, in fact, unquestioned superiority. Time and time again Republicans have shown their disrespect, ignorance, and contempt for other nationalities and cultures. It's as if they've never left the country and think that the rest of the world lives in grass huts and has yet to discover indoor plumbing.
Simply stating that we as a country are exceptional, defined by Merriam-Webster as "much better than average," doesn't mean that it's true. We are behind most developed countries in education, infrastructure, standard of living, workers' rights, freedom of the press, health care, and public transportation, to name just a few areas where we fall behind. It's worth mentioning that Merriam-Webster also defines "exceptional" as mentally or physically disabled.
