President Barack Obama is pushing back against critics who say his plans to fight the deadly Ebola virus have been weak and inept.
Obama indirectly criticized governors who have required the quarantine of public health workers returning to the United States from West African countries where Ebola is prevalent if these workers have been in contact with Ebola patients. Those governors include Chris Christie of New Jersey, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2016.
