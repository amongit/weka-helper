There will be many phases in the 2016 presidential race, including the contests for raising money, framing themes, recruiting strategists, building field organizations, and establishing credibility with the media. But one phase isn’t getting the attention it deserves: the likability test. And this could be the most important of all.
Likability isn’t the only factor in determining who wins the presidency. The candidates’ stands on issues, their experience and their records will make a big difference. But presidents play such a big part in our lives, and Americans are so enamored of positive personalities in public figures that being likable has become an indispensable quality for a candidate to have.
