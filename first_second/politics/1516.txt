While the debate over Syria and whether to pursue military action is still ongoing, this 2007 clip highlighting a 2002 speech by then-Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama during the lead-up to the Iraq war is starting to get some attention online.
The video, posted by BarackObama.com almost exactly six years ago, shows 13 seconds of the original speech given on October 2, 2002, in Chicago, followed by a re-creation of select portions as recited by Obama supporters.
