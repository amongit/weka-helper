A tough stretch for Chris Christie got a little tougher: The International Business Times reports that the New Jersey governor’s office is under federal investigation, this time on allegations he or his staff used their power to quash grand jury indictments against some of the governor’s backers. From David Sirota’s report:
Two criminal investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday interviewed the man who leveled those charges, Bennett Barlyn. He was fired from the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office in August 2010, and subsequently brought a whistleblower lawsuit against the Christie administration, claiming he had been punished for objecting to the dismissal of the indictments of the governor's supporters for a range of corrupt activities.
