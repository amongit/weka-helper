I recently had lunch with Congresswoman Niki Tsongas in Washington D.C. Niki is the current U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district. She is the widow of Paul Tsongas, who was a United States Senator from Massachusetts from 1978 to 1984 and who was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1992 presidential election. Paul also previously served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts 5th congressional district from 1974-1978, the seat that would eventually be held by his wife. The Tsongas name in Lowell, Massachusetts is synonymous with progress, pride and determination as the city has been very much positively influenced by this family's ability to bring in National Park services, money and businesses to make Lowell a shining star in the Commonwealth as it once was during the industrial revolution.
During my time with Niki, I was interested in what makes her tick. As a child, she lived around the world, being the daughter of an Air Force colonel. After graduating high school in Japan, she went to college at Michigan State University, but later transferred to Smith College in Massachusetts. After college, Niki became a social worker in NYC, and later went on to become an attorney, and started the first all-female law firm in Lowell, MA. Niki has achieved huge goals. She has overcome adversity, having experienced the loss of her husband after his battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She has raised three girls, traveled the world, campaigned with her husband in his bid for the Democratic nomination for President, and has held such positions as Dean of External Affairs of Middlesex Community College, Board Member for Fallon Community Health Plan and served on the Lowell Civic Stadium and Arena Commission, which oversaw several sites, including the Tsongas Arena.
