Lawmakers in several states are considering legislation that would ban conversion therapy, a controversial practice that's sometimes touted as a gay "cure" that has proven harmful and been denounced by many, including the American Psychiatric Association.
A bipartisan effort called the “Youth Mental Health Protection Act” being pushed in West Virginia says "being lesbian, gay, or bisexual is not a disease, disorder, illness, deficiency, or shortcoming," citing the APA's findings on conversion therapy as proof a ban is needed.
