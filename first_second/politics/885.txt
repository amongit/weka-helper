Former President George W. Bush praises Hillary Clinton as a formidable politician but he says his brother Jeb would defeat her if both of them ran for president in 2016.
Bush told CNN that he and his family have developed a warm relationship with former President Bill Clinton, Hillary's husband. Bush sometimes calls his predecessor his "brother from another mother." And he told CNN this makes Hillary Clinton "my sister in law."
