When asked whether the respondent hoped there would be a female president, only 16 percent of GOP men and 20 percent of Republican women said yes. Could it be because of Sarah Palin?
Over the weekend, Sarah Palin delivered a rambling, incoherent speech at a conservative forum in Iowa, panned by conservatives as much as liberals. Some blamed it on a faulty teleprompter. But that's ironic because Sarah Palin has been making a living slamming President Barack Obama for having a teleprompter. Democrats sent her a thank you for the speech. She must have forgotten to write her speech on her hand. Those who live by the teleprompter joke die by a teleprompter fail.
