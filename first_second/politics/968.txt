Politico slugged its breaking news alert: “House Democrats on Tuesday re-elected Rep. Nancy Pelosi to serve as minority leader for another two years.”
It wasn’t exactly a surprise. Like the sun coming up, it would only really be news if it didn’t happen – this, despite Pelosi having presided over losses which saw her party reduced to the lowest number of House seats since the Truman administration.
