"Politics is too important to be left to the politicians," John F. Kennedy, Jr.
This week, President Obama participated in an MSNBC/Telemundo town hall on immigration hosted by José Díaz-Balart at Florida International University. The President made news for slamming the Republicans and their policies. He made it abundantly clear that he would do everything in his power to reform the immigration system, as it is no doubt one of the most important issues facing our nation.
