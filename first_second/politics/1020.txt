Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains one of the most creative minds on the American political scene, gave some pointed advice Wednesday to Robert McDonald, the presidentâ€™s choice to head up the beleaguered Department of Veterans Affairs.
In an open letter, Gingrich identifies a near-total transformation of the way the department conducts its affairs as the only way to resolve the issues that have led to the death of veterans who were placed on waiting lists while needing medical care.
