Washington (CNN)Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back strongly on Sunday against the outrage over Republican senators' letter to Iran, which he called a "manufactured controversy."
McConnell and 46 other Republican senators signed an open letter to Iran's leaders on Monday that became a magnet for criticism this week from President Barack Obama, Democrats and even some Republicans who rebuked the letter as an attempt to undermine negotiations.
