Which do you think is the bigger problem in America today: That the economy offers too many rewards for people at the top, or that the economy is not working well enough for people in the middle and bottom? Some would say both are serious problems with emphasis on the corrupting influence of the super-rich in the political process following the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case. However, a far larger number of Americans would say the real problem is stagnant wages for low wage and even middle class workers. Most Americans are less concerned with lowering the ceiling than raising the floor.
When Democrats use phrases like "closing the income gap" or addressing "inequality" they are not being clear whether they really mean they want to hold back income from the very rich, increase income for everyone else, or a combination of the two. These are somewhat abstract concepts that inspire many Americans but are viewed as divisive by many others. The aspirations of the majority of American workers can be addressed more concretely in terms that nearly everyone sees as offering a direct benefit to their own family: a growing economy that is providing jobs with higher pay for all income levels. "Inclusive prosperity," the goal of a growing economy where the benefits of growth are broadly shared, is a more potent economic frame for Democrats to appeal to the forgotten middle class heading into the 2016 election.
