New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday switched over to defensive mode over objections raised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over an advertisement issued on the latter's chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal.
Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who was fielded by the BJP to respond to AAP's charges, expressed dismay over AAP raising the issue. "It is extremely sad that political parties are twisting the word which was meant to do a political attack. What Kejriwal is doing is violation of Model Code of Conduct to gain political mileage."
