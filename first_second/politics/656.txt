Three weeks into the new Congress, Republicans in charge have already kept one of their major campaign promises: to reopen the regular amendment process. New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has allowed votes on 16 amendments, surpassing the 15 amendment votes his predecessor, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., allowed in all of 2014.
Does that mean Congress is getting more done â€“ or less? All but one of the amendments so far have been on a single bill to build the Keystone XL pipeline extension. And the upper chamber has passed just one bill so far this year, reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.
