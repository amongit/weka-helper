Most rapes and sexual assaults go unreported, and college students are less likely than non-students to report them, according to new data from the U.S. Justice Department. While 32 percent of non-student victims choose to report the incident to police, only 20 percent of students do.
A report from the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics looked at women ages 18 to 24, who are most at risk for rape and sexual assault. In 2013, there were 1.4 victims of rape or sexual assault for every 1,000 females ages 12 to 17 and 25 and older.
