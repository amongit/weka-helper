Leon Panetta's incisive critique of President Barack Obama--which is being widely discussed in Washington--is important for two reasons: It comes from one of the most respected public servants to work in government during the past four decades, and it confirms the doubts that many who know Obama have voiced privately about his flawed judgment and stubborn insistence on doing things his way.
I've known and respected Panetta for 20 years. And like so many others, I find Panetta's resume to be sterling and his reputation for fairness and decency unassailable. He is the son of Italian immigrants, worked in Richard Nixon's White House for a while, then switched to the Democratic party and served as a U.S. representative from California. He chaired the House Budget Committee, became Bill Clinton's budget director and was named Clinton's chief of staff. He took a break from government during George W. Bush's administration but returned to become President Obama's CIA director and then defense secretary.
