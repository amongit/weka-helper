Drinking underage and binge drinking have continued to decline in recent years, and have reached their lowest levels since data started to be collected in 1975, a new government survey shows.
The 2014 Monitoring the Future Survey, jointly released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the University of Michigan, used data from more than 41,000 students from 377 public and private schools throughout the U.S. It found alcohol consumption rates among eighth, 10th and 12th graders have continued their long-term decline, reporting past month use of 9, 23.5 and 37.4 percent respectively, compared to 10.2, 25.7, and 39.2 percent during 2013.
