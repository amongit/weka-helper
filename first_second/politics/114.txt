(CNN)Govs. Scott Walker and Jeb Bush are locked in a dead heat as the favorites for the Republican presidential nomination, according to a new poll.
With 18% and 16%, respectively, Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Bush, the former governor of Florida, lead the pack of prospective Republican presidential candidates according to a nationwide Quinnipiac poll released Thursday of Republican and Republican-leaning voters.
