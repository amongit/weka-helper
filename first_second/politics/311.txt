If you can't make a student's loan balance smaller, figure out how she might not have to pay it at all. That's the knock against President Obama's many-pronged strategy for reducing student-debt burden on borrowers. Critics say his solutions don't solve the underlying problem, which is that students are taking on too much debt in the first place. And the student-loan aid doesn't address an even deeper problem, which is that college costs too much for what these students get, particularly when they don't graduate.
These underlying problems really aren't the administration's fault, although it would be helpful for all policymakers to think about how to address them. While they are pondering those weighty questions, White House officials are simply using the executive tools at their disposal to ease a problem affecting 40 million Americans. We didn't get to $1.2 trillion in student debt overnight, and we're not going to get out of it quickly, either.
