Dear Karl Rove,
Good job injecting $300 million into the immediate economy. Don't worry about having nothing to show for it, American's are used to seeing billions of their tax dollars spent on things like stealth bombers that are a complete waste of our money. I am not shocked that the Republicans chose to use their own internal polling system to ascertain the party's strength... you guys believe in so many things that are born out of arrogance and narcissism. The truth is that the same God that you claim tells many of your candidates to run for office, decided to rain out your convention and cause havoc before the vote to remind people that Obama at least cares about people and not just the ones depicted on our currency.
