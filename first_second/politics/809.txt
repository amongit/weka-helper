So Washington had a snow day when spring was meant to be upon us. Never mind, we have other stuff on our minds. But not politics as usual.
Like, did you know the Senate had a huge slumber party Friday night going into Saturday's dawn? They broke up at 5 a.m. after an extraordinary "voting marathon" on the budget, said The Washington Post. That gave everyone a chance to know each other better, you know, with all the new faces lately. Yes, you could hear the legislators laugh as background music while the gavel was pounded for order.
