It's hard to give a shit about politics any more. It's hard to want to devote yourself to a cause, get out in the streets; let alone write your congressmen. Seriously, does anyone feel like anything gets accomplished by penning a letter to man who has more reason to listen to a K-Street lobbyist with good media connections than a constituent who is likely to forget to register to vote before his district's arbitrary filing deadline? Even the most civically devoted citizens, which I once considered myself to be, have countless reasons to be skeptical of the power of citizenship these days. But, on September 21 the People's Climate March on New York City is a reason to show what power really looks like, what it can do, and it couldn't be for a more worthy cause. Unlike picking a side during an election, debating a health care law or arguing about who should be taxed at what level, advocating for addressing climate change won't come back to bite you in the ass. It's different from what we have become accustomed to.
