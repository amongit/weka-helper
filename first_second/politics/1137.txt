Jeb Bush pinpointed Iran’s race towards nuclear weapons as the “defining foreign policy issue of our time” Wednesday, while only offering a vague policy prescription for how to confront the barbarism of the Islamic State that continues to terrorize the Middle East.
At the opening of a 25-minute speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Bush called on Congress to reinstate sanctions in advance of the Obama administration’s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear enrichment program and require approval of any deal that’s ultimately reached.
