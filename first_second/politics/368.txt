New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's oft-repeated slogan of a Congress-'mukt' Bharat has cost his own Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dear in the Delhi Assembly elections. With Delhi becoming Congress-mukt, it has gone to help Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
For the first time in Indian political history, the Congress failed to open its account in any Assembly election which it contested. The drubbing Congress got can be gauged from the fact that its face in the Delhi Assembly elections Ajay Maken, who was the party's Campaign Committee chairperson, also lost miserably from Sadar Bazar constituency. Owning responsibility for the debacle, Maken immediately resigned from the post of party's national general secretary.
