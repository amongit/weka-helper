BOCA RATON, Fla. – Republican governors suggested the best counter to President Barack Obama’s pending executive action on illegal immigration may be taking him to court.
At a GOP conference here Wednesday, at least two governors contemplating runs for the presidency in 2016 said legal action is likely the best way to stop Obama’s move to grant legal status to millions of undocumented workers.
