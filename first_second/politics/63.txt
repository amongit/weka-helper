Washington (CNN)The Republican congressman leading the House investigation into the terror attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi said the House may vote to subpoena Hillary Clinton's emails housed on her private home server.
Rep. Trey Gowdy said he hopes "it doesn't get to that point," but left the door open to action by the full House to compel Clinton to hand over her private email server to an independent, third-party auditor.
