Get out your popcorn everyone, because the Republican Civil War is starting to really get good.
As I wrote yesterday, there is growing evidence that the GOP leadership is trying to make a shutdown pivot, reframing its demands in terms of spending, the budget and entitlements rather than Obamacare (prompting NBC's First Read to ask if the GOP even knows what it wants right now). Leadership's problem is that this sends the fanatical right – the people who forced the shutdown in the first place – into new rounds of apoplexy.
