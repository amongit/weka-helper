A Massachusetts man convicted of burning down a black church out of anger over the election of President Barack Obama was sentenced to nearly 14 years in federal prison on Thursday.
According to prosecutors, in the early-morning hours after Obama's election on Nov. 4, 2008, 27-year-old Michael Jacques and several accomplices used gasoline to torch the Macedonia Church of God in Christ's nearly-completed $2.5 million worship center in Springfield, Mass. No parishioners or church staff were in the building at the time.
