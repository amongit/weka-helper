A nonprofit group backing President Barack Obama's policy and political priorities raised nearly $6 million during the first three months of 2014.
The group, Organizing for Action, was reorganized into an agenda-driving structure after the 2012 election. It said in a Friday press release that the overall average donation to the group was $38.68 and that it has received 124,637 contributions since January.
