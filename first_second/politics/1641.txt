Last week, I spent an hour at a witness table next to Shaun McCutcheon, the lead plaintiff in the eponymous Supreme Court case that dissenting Justice Stephen Breyer wrote "eviscerate[d] our campaign finance laws."
Along with Mr. McCutcheon's lawyer and two others at the table, we were five of the 30 "expert" witnesses who joined one of the panels at a day long hearing at the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
