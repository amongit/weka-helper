Eight protestors were arrested Thursday afternoon in Miami during a demonstration against the 2013 death of a local teenager and the fatal shooting last week of an unarmed black youth in Ferguson, Missouri.
Israel Hernandez, of Miami Beach, and Michael Brown, of Ferguson, were both 18 when they lost their lives in run-ins with police officers. Both were minorities. In addition, said event organizer Phil Agnew in an email, both young men are "proof that racist police departments around the country will continue to use black and brown bodies for target practice."
