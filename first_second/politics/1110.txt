Another day, another poll showing that the tea party's shutdown showdown strategy on Obamacare is a political loser.
Today's survey of public opinion comes courtesy of the United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, which asked Americans whether or not they support the idea of shutting the government down if President Obama refuses to defund his signature program, the Affordable Care Act. This defund-or-shut-down tack is the one House Republicans embarked on last week when they passed a bill that will keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 but also defunds Obamacare.
