Easter Monday in Boston and the city's great marathon is on. But you didn't need me to tell you that. It's all over the national air, the first since the fatal bombing and manhunt that took place last April. The revered former mayor, Thomas Menino, came out to mark the anniversary last week. "You are strong at this broken place," he said. Even without that element, it is the classic Boston Marathon and no other. The greatest since, well, the ancient Greek runner who dropped dead after giving the message to the king.
Ever since a silversmith in the North End made a famed midnight ride, Boston's always the standout city, the A-plus student, adept at making its story the national story. I say this as a confirmed city girl who knows her way around Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and Baltimore. As a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, I once got mugged on a rainy Easter Monday. It didn't even make the paper. Baltimore is the arch-opposite of Boston. When it does capture the national imagination, it's in a Dickensian way. You know what I mean, David Simon? The city won't live "The Wire" down for a long time to come. Not that it wasn't brilliant, David (who covered the police for the paper).
