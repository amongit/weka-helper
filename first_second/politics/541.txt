Congress does more than just fight, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) proved that Thursday when she showed up for a press conference with a sign of support for her Senate counterpart, Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who's recovering from eye surgery.
Reid, who fell and injured himself while exercising in January, had surgery on his right eye two weeks ago. He had been wearing a bandage over the eye. However, Tuesday he was spotted wearing some sweet shades that looked slightly out of place inside the Capitol.
