Members of Congress mark the fiftieth anniversary of Bloody Sunday. (All photos by Ari Berman)
This weekend marked the fifteenth year that John Lewis has led a bipartisan congressional delegation on a civil-rights pilgrimage to Alabama, under the auspices of the Faith and Politics Institute. This year 100 members of Congress joined him, the largest delegation in the pilgrimageâ€™s history. I was lucky enough to tag along.
