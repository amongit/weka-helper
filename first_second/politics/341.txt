Speaking at a press conference Thursday morning to address the earlier shooting of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar drew parallels between this incident and the December 2014 killing of two officers in Brooklyn, New York.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we were very close to having happen what happened in the NYPD with Officer Ramos and Officer Liu," Belmar said, referring to Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, two New York City policemen who were shot and killed while sitting in their patrol car a few days before Christmas. "We could have buried two police officers over this."
