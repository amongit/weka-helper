Happy Tuesday, the 41st day of 2015 and the 14th year since then-President George W. Bush signed a Congressionally approved bill granting him authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks â€“ power he then used to invade Iraq 17 months after 9/11. National security analysts say that invasion, and the instability that followed, helped create the conditions that spawned the Islamic State group. President Barack Obama, who won office by opposing the Iraq invasion, reportedly will give Congress a revamped AUMF bill that formally gives him permission to fight Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, even though U.S. forces have been bombing the insurgents there since September, and the bill could mean U.S. troops head back to Iraq (see below).
