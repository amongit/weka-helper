New Delhi: The BJP on Wednesday once again lashed out at Aam Aadmi Party and its chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal over the alleged funding and asked them to reply to the questions being asked by it.
Talking to mediapersons, Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that Kejriwal is running away from answering to their questions over the alleged money-laundering and bogus funding to AAP. He praised the media for investigating the matter.
