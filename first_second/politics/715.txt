To address the issues brought to a head with the shooting of a black teenager by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri, the White House has unveiled an initiative that includes a push for more body cameras for police. The family of Michael Brown, the black teen shot by police officer Darren Wilson, also has advocated for their use. “Join with us in our campaign to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera,” they said in a statement after Wilson was not indicted in Brown’s death.
