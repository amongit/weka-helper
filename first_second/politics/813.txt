Who was the breathtaking modern young woman, 28, who outwitted President Woodrow Wilson at the first turn in 1913 and won their battle of wills at the end of seven years?
Alice Paul was her name and the president never really had a chance against her. With fresh, defiant street tactics she learned abroad in London, Paul deftly led the "Votes for Women!" suffrage movement to victory years after the aging Susan B. Anthony died. So please don't say women were "granted" or given the vote, as men do. It was taken and won by womenâ€”Quaker women, who were born, raised, and educated as equals in their families within the Protestant Society of Friends. Paul and Anthony were Quakers. Paul is an alumna of Swarthmore College, class of 1905.
