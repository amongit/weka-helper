California Assemblyman Rocky Chavez (R-Calif.) announced Thursday that he plans to run for the U.S. Senate seat that will open up when Democrat Barbara Boxer retires.
Chavezâ€™s plans could help Republicans boost their appeal among Hispanics during an election season in which the contentious issue of immigration will likely loom large. But he will face a tough race in a decidedly blue state where Democrats currently monopolize statewide offices.
