Last week, I attended the Watermark Conference with Hillary Clinton in Silicon Valley. I, like most of the 5,000 women in attendance, was filled with pent-up excitement about the prospect of Hillary running for president again in 2016. The feeling in the air was feverish and Hillary was greeted with wild enthusiasm.
Hillary gave a great speech and cited powerful statistics about gender inequality in Silicon Valley. She was her usual brilliant self, and there is no question in my mind that she is more than qualified to be president. The notes that Hillary hit were received very positively, and it was obvious from the palpable energy in the room that we were all more excited than ever about a Clinton candidacy. She was -- in a word -- inspiring.
