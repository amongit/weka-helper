With congressional Republicans and the White House stuck in familiar disagreements after the release of President Obama's latest fiscal blueprint this week, the first step out of the impasse may be to recognize that the federal budget faces two distinct imbalances. The first is the gap between revenues and expenditures that produces unsustainable deficits and debt. Less recognized, but also threatening, is the budget's increasing tilt toward consumption over investment and toward seniors over children.
The two sides might find more common ground on that second imbalance. And addressing it could create more momentum to tackle the first. Since the 1960s, the federal budget's focus has radically shifted toward current consumption and away from investment in future generations. In 1969, the Office of Management and Budget classified 31 percent of federal spending as investments—including infrastructure, scientific research, and education and training—and an equal 31 percent as payments to individuals. By 2014, payments to individuals had soared to 72 percent of federal spending, and investments had plummeted to 13 percent, the smallest share ever recorded.
