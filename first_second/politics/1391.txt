Humiliating their leader again, House Republicans rejected Speaker John Boehner's last minute, desperate attempt to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for three weeks. Instead, in what is another sad look at how truly incapable of governing today's Republican Party is, a one week emergency extension was passed with massive Democratic Party support.
Howls from the right-wing caucus seeking a knife fight over the DHS bill could be heard across Capitol Hill. And moderates are equally outraged that the GOP has been hijacked by the "delusional wing of the party," as Rep. Pete King (R-NY) said.
