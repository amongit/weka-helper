President Barack Obama is having more trouble generating support for a controversial deal with Iran to limit Tehran's nuclear program.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declared his intention to have the Republican-controlled Congress take action on an accord, which could mean that many legislators, and perhaps a big majority, could vote to block it. "Apparently the administration is on the cusp of entering into a very bad deal with one of the worst regimes in the world that would allow them to continue to have their nuclear infrastructure," McConnell told CNN Sunday. "We're alarmed about it."
