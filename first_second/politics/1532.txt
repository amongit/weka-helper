President Obama had a lot to celebrate on Monday, so it came as no surprise when the commander-in-chief let loose during the inaugural parade.
As a jazz band passed the president's viewing booth in front of the White House during the afternoon parade, Obama was spotted standing up and dancing along to the music, smiling and waving at the musicians as their float went by. CBS News captured the moment on tape.
