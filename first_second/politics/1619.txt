Sometimes I feel that I am the last of the Mapai'niks*: a vanishing species of people who had deep convictions about identifying with the Jewish people, about taking responsibility for the destiny of the Jews; about mending themselves as part of a universal movement aimed at making the world a better place, taking care of the weak in society, striving for a more egalitarian society. This dual goal combined national redemption and world redemption, but it was never stated in absolute terms -- it was always qualified: not the absolute redemption, either of the Jews or of the world. Mapai'niks were always wary of all-encompassing utopianism.
