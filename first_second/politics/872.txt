President Barack Obama sees 2015 as a year of likely confrontation with Republicans who will control Congress starting in January.
His recent remarks suggest that Obama is eager to draw contrasts with his opposition in order to cast Republicans in a bad light and underscore his argument that he and fellow Democrats are on the side of the middle class. His ultimate goal is to frame the political debate for the 2016 national election in a way that enhances prospects for the next Democratic presidential nominee and the party's other candidates, Democratic strategists say.
