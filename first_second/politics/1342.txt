Here are some headlines appearing in major newspapers recently: • "A Deeply Divided Supreme Court . . ."; • "Divided Congress is Deeply Fractionalized . . ."; • "The Deep Divide in Congress . . ."; • "Obama Warns a Divided Congress . . ."; • "The Sharp Political Divide in America . . ."; • "The Most Divided Congress Ever . . ."
These stories all suggest that the United States today is so divided along political lines that the politicians are unable to pass meaningful legislation and that judges (even in the Supreme Court) are unable to make unbiased legal decisions. But does a sharply divided America necessarily mean that no meaningful legislation can emerge from our political leaders on both sides of the aisle? I don't think so! What many people describe as the greatest political agreement in the history of the world came out of a deeply divided America in November 1787 -- the United States Constitution.
