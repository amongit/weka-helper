LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan’s public records law allows anyone to request information that can help shine a light on what government is doing, but not all of government is subject to those disclosure requirements.
Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act does not cover the governor, lieutenant governor, their offices or legislators. It does, however, cover state departments, local governments and schools.
