President Barack Obama is struggling with two national security issues that could have serious consequences for the country and could make or break his second termâ€“the potential for an epidemic of the Ebola virus, and the military gains being made by Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria despite a U.S.-led bombing campaign against them.
White House officials are trying to put the best spin on recent setbacks in the war against the extremists, also known as ISIS or ISIL. "This is going to be a long-term campaign, and there will not be any quick fixes involved," Obama said Tuesday. He gave this assessment during a meeting with military leaders from 20 allied countries near Washington. Obama conceded that there have been "periods of setback" but added: "Our coalition is united behind this long-term effort."
