When I became the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee more than a year ago, I made it my mission to bring more Americans into the budget process by listening to their ideas, and by giving them a voice at the table. The reason was simple: I believe our government works best when Congress acts on the priorities and values of the people we represent.
The voices of people across the country guided me as I worked with Republicans last year to get a two-year budget deal that rolled back automatic budget cuts from sequestration, invested more in jobs and economic growth, and prevented another government shutdown. And now, I'm hoping you'll continue to help me as we work to build on that two-year deal this year.
