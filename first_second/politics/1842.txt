Historically low turnout. Last minute changes to voter ID laws. Reductions to early voting just before voters should have been able to cast a ballot. 2014 was a watershed year for restrictive voting laws and court battles that caused confusion for voters and certainly did not drive them to vote. We cannot precisely calculate the impact these changes had on voters but the potential negative impact cannot be swept under the rug. One thing is certain: 2015 must be a year for progressive electoral reform.
The story in the wake of the 2014 midterm election was the historically low turnout nationwide. Yet, in just two years, the country will experience a presidential election, which no doubt will garner massive interest and result in much higher voter turnout rates. If states continue to turn a blind eye to the adverse effects of restrictive voting laws currently being implemented across the country, many more voters will bear the brunt of these, and potentially other, harmful changes in the 2016 presidential election. Do we really want to see a continuing trend toward less participation in voting, undermining the very essence of our democracy?
