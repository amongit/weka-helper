MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - With one major provision dropped and two others trimmed, a hotly debated gun control bill heads to the Vermont Senate this week.
The original legislation included language calling for background checks on all private gun sales, except those between immediately family members. That was strongly opposed by gun-rights groups and is no longer part of the bill.
