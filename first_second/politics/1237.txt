Three Things You Should Know (and a Cartoon)
Exit Strategy: On Friday, after Democrats helped Speaker John Boehner use his final timeout on the Department of Homeland Security shutdown countdown, Boehner’s team scrambled through the House rule book for something – anything – that resembled an escape clause. And they found it: an obscure, arcane rule that could fund DHS for a full year and let Boehner plausibly argue that he didn’t cave in to the saner wing of the GOP caucus, or logic, or functional government. Because Obama’s immigration tyranny must be fought with the paychecks of airport security agents! The precise wording of the rule is too complicated to explain here, but the net effect is kind of like pretending the cable’s out instead of punishing the sugar-addicted brats threatening to trash your living room unless they get to watch “Despicable Me 2.”
