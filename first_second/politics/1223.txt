Why We Can’t Have Nice Things: The Republican-majority Congress has been in session for three months and change, and already the record’s not looking so good for the party in charge, what with the stumbling, bumbling and shutdown-threatening. For those wondering why, another example dropped this week when a bipartisan, no-brainer bill designed to prevent human trafficking – principally, the kidnapping or coercing of young women and girls usually for the underground sex trade – got bogged down in the Senate when Democrats noticed the GOP had slipped in an anti-abortion language when no one was looking. Not a particularly good look for Republicans: putting an anti-abortion rider into a bill that punishes human trafficking, even though sexual abuse is the leading reason human trafficking – the crime they’re trying to punish – exists in the first place. What should have been a win-win, where the GOP gets credit for passing actual legislation and Dems get traction on a gender issue, doesn’t happen because of the siren song of party ideology.
