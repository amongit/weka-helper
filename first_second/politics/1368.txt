WASHINGTON -- Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chair of the Senate Budget Committee, sent a strongly worded letter to her colleagues on Friday urging them to address climate change as an economic imperative.
"Climate change is real and its impacts pose serious threats to our country," Murray writes in the opening line of her missive. "But this is not just an environmental issue," she continues. "Climate change will also have serious ramifications for our economy and the federal budget, and failure to confront it will make it harder to meet our nation's long-term fiscal challenges."
