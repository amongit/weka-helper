Always in late November, there is a somber moment when Americans return to the day John F. Kennedy was slain in Dallas in 1963. Except this November 22, the date will hit a knell of 50 years ago.
America wept. Shattered, the nation lost its innocence with two rifle shots ripping through the air at a parade, aimed at the bronzed president with ocean blue eyes. The Thousand Days of the JFK presidency, with compliments to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (my editor's wise father) vanished yonder in the big Texas sky. Like a legend, the king was dead in broad daylight, for all Americans to witness such an act of violence for the first time ever, in black and white television. We'd never be the same.
