WASHINGTON -- In recent days, multiple news outlets -- from the Washington Post to the Chicago Sun-Times to Bloomberg -- have reported that Chicago businesswoman and Obama fundraiser Penny Pritzker is a top candidate to become the president's next secretary of commerce.
Although it remains little more than chatter at this point, the prospect of a Pritzker Department of Commerce has already caught the attention of a core progressive constituency that's backed the president: unions and labor activists.
