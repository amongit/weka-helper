A venerable academic survey confirms the dramatic rise in support for same-sex marriage. Reports of Scott Walker's electability may be overstated. And Americans support pay equity, but is it a voting issue? This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 6, 2015.
GSS SHOWS MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR SAME SEX MARRIAGE - Emily Swanson: "In the late 1980s, support for gay marriage was essentially unheard of in America. Just a quarter century later, it's now favored by clear majority of Americans. That dramatic shift in opinion is among the fastest changes ever measured by the General Social Survey, a comprehensive and widely respected survey that has measured trends on a huge array of American attitudes for more than four decades. Support for a right of same-sex couples to marry has risen 8 percentage points in the past two years and jumped 45 points since the question was first asked in 1988, when only 11 percent of Americans said they agreed with the idea. The survey now finds that only a third of Americans are opposed to gay marriage. The largest shift in support since 2012 has come among Republicans, just under half of whom — 45 percent — now support marriage rights for same-sex couples. That's a jump of 14 percentage points since 2012." [AP]
