Washington works in mysterious ways, if it is working at all. Henry Paulson, the former treasury secretary in the George W. Bush White House, has been so kind as to grace us with his position on climate change, which is that it's real, and something serious must be done about it. Paulson, a.k.a. "Hank," recommends a tax on carbon emissions.
Sorry, but it's too late in the game for Paulson to get involved. He could have made a difference by taking a courageous stand in the corridors of power, when he was a cabinet policymaker at the highest level and had the president's ear. Right now, the Republican party is so swept away by the tea party tempest that an allegedly wise man like Paulson sadly won't change anyone's stance or behavior. It's nice for Hank that he gets to feel he did the right thing. His old-guard tennis friends will rib him good-naturedly across the net. He'll figure, over a gin and tonic, that there are some principled Republicans left in Washington after all, and he's one of them.
