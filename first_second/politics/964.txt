1863. The nation is divided by a bloody civil war pitting father against son and brother against brother. Few people had much to be thankful for. In the midst of all this, President Abraham Lincoln took the extraordinary step of declaring a national day of Thanksgiving, an annual holiday to observe the blessing the Almighty had seen fit to bestow upon a fractured people.
It was not the first time a call for such a celebration had been issued. The pilgrims who populated the Plymouth Colony undertook the first of such events after a particularly harsh winter had brought with it nearly unbearable hardships that threatened the survival of all. When Lincoln put pen to paper he created a tradition honored up to this day.
