"Can we all get along?"
That famous plea, uttered by Rodney King in the aftermath of his infamous pounding by police, is a persistent theme in a Washington beset by bickering, demonizing, and poisonous relationships. Recently, The Washington Post had two columns, by Dana Milbank and Ruth Marcus, that were interesting takes on the meme. Milbank drew on the Discovery Channel pairing of Republican Sen. Jeff Flake and Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich on a barren Pacific Island, where survival depended on teamwork, trust, and cooperation. Flake said of Senate party leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, "If they would spend six days and nights on an island, we could move legislation forward here." He added slyly, "And if they didn't survive, we could still move legislation here." Heinrich underscored the importance of a lack of trust among lawmakers, the loss of a glue that worked in an earlier era to cement agreement among individuals with very different philosophies.
