Sounds like the start of a bad joke: three immigration opponents, dressed like supporters, and a Catholic bishop walk into a Republican House subcommittee hearing…
Only it happened Wednesday at the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Enforcement, and Democrats weren’t laughing, reports U.S. News’ Gabrielle Levy. Neither was the Southern Poverty Law Center, which slammed the hearing – headed by Rep.Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican – as a farce and called out three of the four witnesses as anti-immigrant supporters in hard-line clothing.
