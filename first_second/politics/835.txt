President Barack Obama is ratcheting up the pressure on majority Republicans in Congress over the immigration issue, portraying the GOP as behind the times and on the wrong side of history.
Obama urged Republicans to renew financing for the Department of Homeland Security and end their attempt to link that funding with a rollback of Obama's executive actions to limit deportations. The department is in charge of carrying out the president's immigration policies.
