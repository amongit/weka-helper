Senate Democrats have been trying to find a carrot sufficient to induce one more Republican to support an extension of emergency federal long-term unemployment benefits, expressing optimism this week that they can reach a deal. Now one of the big outside progressive groups working on this issue is bringing the stick to the effort with a new TV ad targeting one of the Republican lawmakers.
Americans United for Change is set to run a brutal ad saying that Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk is “personally responsible” for Illinoisans losing their unemployment benefits and “can get them restored.” The logic is simple: One more Republican vote is needed to pass an extension and Kirk can be that vote.
