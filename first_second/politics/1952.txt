(AP) LONDON â€” A light aircraft carrying a candidate for a minor party in Britain's election crashed Thursday, but officials said the pilot and passenger escaped with minor injuries.
The plane was towing a banner for the euroskeptic UK Independence Party when it crashed at a small airfield about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of London. Nigel Farage, a former leader of the party and its candidate in the area, was on board.
