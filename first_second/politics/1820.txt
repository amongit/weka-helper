I know the stats. And they are depressing: the gender gap both in compensation (good karma notwithstanding) and participation in executive roles is alive and well. I have spoken on this topic on many panels and will continue to carry this message forward. Among the depressing numbers: for S&P 500 companies, women represent only five percent of CEOs, 15 percent of C-suite roles, and 17 percent of board positions.
At the same time, I feel something big and positive is happening for women now, something that may change that underrepresentation. What used to feel like a collection of dots of voices for empowering women, now feels increasingly connected, like an unstoppable force for social change; it is becoming shameful NOT to change. As a result, I believe we are going to look back at this coming decade as a time of the most profound change in cultural and economic attitudes toward women in my lifetime.
