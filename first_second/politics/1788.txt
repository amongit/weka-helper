WASHINGTON -- A federal judge's ruling halting the president's executive actions on immigration did little to persuade either party in Congress to publicly back down from a budget standoff.
Republicans professed they remained resolved not to fund the Department of Homeland Security without provisions reversing President Barack Obama's expansion of deferred action immigration programs that would allow up to 4.7 million potential recipients to stay and receive work authorization. Democrats, meanwhile, showed no willingness to soften their insistence on "clean" DHS funding, arguing that Republicans could now pursue their case against Obama in court instead of in Congress.
