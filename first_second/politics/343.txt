Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has built a name for himself as a foreign policy guru on Capitol Hill, a reputation that will bode well for the freshman senator if he chooses to go ahead and jump into the 2016 presidential fray in a cycle where ISIS and Iran are at the forefront.
During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday focused on the president's request for the Authorization to Use Military Force against ISIS, Secretary of State John Kerry, however, made it clear he still thinks Rubio has a thing or two to learn.
