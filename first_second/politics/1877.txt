Today is National Voter Registration Day (NVRD), the day for eligible Americans everywhere to register to vote! Voting is our chance to stand up for our families and communities by letting politicians know what matters to us. Voting is our duty and responsibility as citizens. With Election Day, November 4, just around the corner, now is the time for all of us to get ready to participate and to help our friends and family get ready too!
