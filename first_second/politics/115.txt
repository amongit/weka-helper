(CNN)A new CNN/ORC poll shows nearly 8 of 10 Americans believe parents should be required to vaccinate their healthy children against preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and polio. If the children are not vaccinated, most agree the child should not be allowed to attend public school or day care.
These results come as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting a total of 154 cases of measles in the country, from January 1, 2015 to February 20, 2015. That's an additional 13 cases in the last week.
