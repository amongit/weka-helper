With the exception of some token “Happy anniversary healthcare.gov!” stuff from the GOP, Obamacare has largely faded as a cutting political issue in the 2014 congressional midterm elections. But we can probably expect for it to make a surprise last-minute comeback, a top Republican pollster said this morning, as GOP candidates try to goose their base one more time.
“I think you’ll see some candidates come back to it late,” Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies said at an appearance with Charlie Cook and Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg, which was sponsored by National Journal. “Obamacare is shorthand for big government bureaucracy, government takeover of health care” so it is a handy way to wave the proverbial bloody shirt in front of the base.
