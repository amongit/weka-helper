I spoke on February 5th at a symposium of the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development, held this year on the topic, "The Achievement Gap: Why Executive Function Matters." My charge was to connect the science of what is called "executive function," which Phil Zelazo, a leader in the field, defines as "brain processes involved in...goal-directed modulation of attention, thought, emotion, motivation and action," akin to self-control and self-direction, and civic science, a movement launched with support of the National Science Foundation last October in which Zelazo participated. Civic science seeks to revitalize scientific values and practices such as cooperation, open inquiry, and the test of ideas in practice as wellsprings of a democratic culture.
The timing of the symposium dramatized wider implications. "Executive function" can be a powerful strand of the democracy movement which is stirring - and a resource for countering a growing attack.
