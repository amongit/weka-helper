After following the 2012 presidential elections for the past three months, I have noticed how the media covers politics -- and I am not exactly liking what I am seeing.
The 24-hour coverage of politics has become a staple in our everyday lives. People can turn on the TV at any time of day or night and watch discussions about the elections, live-coverage of events or public debates over the issues. After experiencing this with the eyes of a first time voter, I discovered that constant news is really something we could live without and even be better for it.
