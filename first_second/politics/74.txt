Washington (CNN)Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee that oversees the Secret Service, warned that the mismanagement at the Secret Service is putting President Barack Obama and his family "in jeopardy."
Speaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Chaffetz said that "we should" be worried about the safety of the first family following the news that the administration is investigating an incident in which two Secret Service agents, who were allegedly drunk, drove into a barrier on White House grounds, and then were allowed to drive off with no repercussions by a supervisor.
