Welcome to Monday, the 59th day of 2015 and the start of a big week in Washington: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives his big speech to Congress, the Supreme Court hears arguments in a big Obamacare case, and the clock is ticking on the Department of Homeland Security fight. That last one – keyed by House Speaker John Boehner, who can’t seem to control Republican radicals dead set on teaching that imperialist, President Barack Obama, a lesson – doesn’t look like it’s going to get resolved before the last minute (see below). That leaves Boehner with a Hobson’s choice: ask Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to name her price, or wring some GOP arms and risk losing his prized speaker’s gavel in a coup. Here’s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:
Warmup Act: Ahead of his big speech on Tuesday, Netanyahu shows up at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington. It’ll be a friendly audience – AIPAC is hawkish in its defense of Israel and tilts right – so Bibi, previewing his congressional speech, should feel at home, and get a lot of validation for slamming the White House over Iran.
