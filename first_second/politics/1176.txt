Ready For Warren -- a group attempting to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., into the 2016 presidential race -- is seeking to obtain 100,000 signatures for its cause by Presidents' Day.
"It's really our way of saying that this is our intense period of organizing. We want to show Warren that now is the time for her," said Erica Sagrans, the group's campaign manager, on a conference call with supporters Sunday night.
