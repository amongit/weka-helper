WASHINGTON -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) has been locking down donors in anticipation of a 2016 presidential run, he's already awash in cash, and he's seen as his party's frontrunner. But Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) has been creeping up in early polling, and he's starting to make the case for why Bush may not be the best choice.
In the March issue of radio host Rush Limbaugh's newsletter, "The Limbaugh Letter," Walker acknowledged that the pull of electing the first female president will be strong for many people. Although he never named Bush, he argued that the best way to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is to offer a fresh face from the Republican Party.
