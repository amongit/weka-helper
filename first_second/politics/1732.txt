Throughout his career, Dr. George Tiller was threatened, harassed, attacked, and finally murdered because he offered compassionate abortion care. His medical center was firebombed in June 1986. He was shot five times in his arms in August 1993. He was shot in the head in May 2009 while serving as an usher at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kan., his home congregation. He died for his faith that God loves those of us who have abortions. He died a martyr.
Dr. Tiller was vilified for his beliefs for decades, and he remained true to his calling. He didn't see a division between his faith and his vocation. He was serving on the board of directors of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice at the time of his murder; the American flag that draped his coffin adorns RCRC's conference room as a holy relic. Dr. Tiller worked tirelessly to ensure abortion-seekers knew they were safe in the deep love God has for them.
