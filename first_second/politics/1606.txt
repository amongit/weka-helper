This piece has been brewing for years. It is not a reaction to the well-organized Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions effort that in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 struck the Bay Area (my hometown of Berkeley in particular). It is a processing of my experiences over the last five years as a Rabbi, a Jew, and a Zionist in the Bay Area.
The Zionism I embrace is Theodor Herzl's two-fold vision: 1) securing international legitimacy for the right of the Jewish people to a state of our own, and 2) actually building our national home. This mission remains incomplete, and it is both everyone's and no one's fault. "Hawks" delegitimize internal critics. "Lefties" denounce rightist campaigns. Both distract the Jewish people from the greatest project in our collective history: The State of Israel.
