Narc Alert: As expected, attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch and Senate Republicans did the Confirmation Tango over immigration during the first full day of hearings: they pushed her on the (somewhat irrelevant) legality of President Barack Obama’s executive action to prevent some deportations, and she simultaneously defended the president’s move, albeit at arm’s length. Perhaps the biggest news out of the hearing, though, was Lynch’s position on pot, which could be a buzzkill for legal-weed voters in Alaska, Oregon, Colorado, Washington state and the District of Columbia: "I can tell you that not only do I not support the legalization of marijuana, it is not the position of the Department of Justice currently to support the legalization," she said. "Nor will it be the position should I be confirmed as attorney general."
