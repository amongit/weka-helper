One of the most striking – and entertaining – things about the spate of polls released this week sketching the post-government-shutdown political landscape is the contrast in public standing between the congressional Republicans and their white whale, Obamacare. In short, people may not like Obamacare, but they really hate Republicans.
So, for example, the CBS News poll released yesterday found that 43 percent of Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare's formal name) and 51 percent disapprove (alas, they didn't drill deeper and get a breakdown of people opposing it because the law goes too far and those opposing it because it doesn't go far enough). But those figures are sterling compared to the public's view of the GOP, which gets 18 percent approval and 78 percent disapproval.
