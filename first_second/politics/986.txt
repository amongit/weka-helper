With just about a month to go, it is not yet clear which party will emerge from the November 2014 election with a majority in the U.S. Senate. At one point, the Republicans were heavily favored to win control of the chamber, but of late the party has seemed unable to close the deal in several key contested races.
One reason is unforeseen trouble in Kansas, where incumbent GOP Sen. Pat Roberts cannot seem to catch a break. The threat to his re-election comes not from a Democrat but from Greg Orman, a multimillionaire investor running as an independent who has been dodging questions about issues important to Kansas like the Keystone XL pipeline. Orman wonâ€™t say which party he would caucus with if he wins, and he positions himself as all things to all voters. Roberts is still in the race, but the uncertainty of the outcome has some longtime election observers believing this is the seat that will determine who controls the Senate for the next two years.
