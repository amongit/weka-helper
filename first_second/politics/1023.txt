Several years ago when I told my wife Francesca that instead of looking for a job (I was freelancing, which is to say underemployed), I should write a book on presidential speechwriters, she looked more than a little alarmed but said with great equanimity: OK, if that's what you think you should do, then you should do it. (This is characteristic, by the way, of why my wife is awesome.) Then she added one condition: But you have to get on "The Daily Show."
Flash forward three years to the spring of 2008 and the publication of my tome, "White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters." (It's a fun read and makes a great Valentine's Day present.) I had told the Simon & Schuster publicist of my "Daily Show" quest and to my great delight she came through. I can forevermore say that Jon Stewart saved my marriage.
