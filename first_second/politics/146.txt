Washington (CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush acknowledged on Wednesday that "there were mistakes made in Iraq" under his brother's watch â€” but he's hired a number of the same policy advisers that shaped that very policy, and were complicit some of those very mistakes.
During a question-and-answer session following his speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Bush said, "There were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure," under President George W. Bush's watch.
