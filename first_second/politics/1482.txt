The president has arguably the most stressful job in America. The pressure of a presidency is immense -- meetings, traveling, lawmaking and diplomacy only begin to scratch the surface. But while running a country leaves little room for downtime, America's leaders, past and present, still try to make some room for recharging.
Finding that time to relax --whether you're the president or climbing the corporate ladder -- isn't only a perk, it's crucial. Mental fatigue and workplace burnout threaten numerous professionals in high-pressure, high-strung jobs, causing serious stress and health risks.
