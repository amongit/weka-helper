Religion must help us reverse climate change.
That was the message in New York from local and global faith leaders who gathered around the UN sessions on climate change. I was in New York, along with hundreds of thousands of other people -- the biggest march against climate change in the world so far -- trying to bring the energy of morality, values, faith, and especially, a commitment to children and grandchildren. The march was marked by its diversity of people and groups and its passion, with many hopeful images of a different future beyond our fossil fuels past and present.
