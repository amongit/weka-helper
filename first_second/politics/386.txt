New Delhi: On a star-studded Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal addressed public meetings in the national capital and came down heavily on each other. While Modi hit out at AAP and accused it of interested only in getting media attention, Kejriwal retorted to Modi's earlier charge and said he was not a 'Naxal'. Sonia slammed Modi and Kejriwal, saying one was a "pracharak" and the other a "dharnebaaj".
Addressing an election rally at Dwarka in West Delhi, Modi said, "If you give a government that believes in agitations, they won't have time to discuss your issues. They only need space in media."
