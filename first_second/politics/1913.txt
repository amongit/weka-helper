WASHINGTON -- A pair of Democratic senators has introduced legislation to reform the nation's chemical safety laws, two days after a bipartisan group of senators released their own chemical legislation.
Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act on Thursday. The senators said their bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate whether chemicals are safe before they are brought to market, would speed up the EPA's process for reviewing chemicals, and would force the agency to review all chemicals already on the market.
