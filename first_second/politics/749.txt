As an American who needs to know more about Africa, like almost all of us, I was lucky enough to meet Amini Kajunju while the historic U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit was going on. It's a huge gesture by President Barack Obama's administration, bringing together heads of state, business leaders and policymakers. A dinner will be given tonight at the White House, but the events are going on all over town.
I asked Kajunju to speak to me – and readers – in a conversational tone as I asked her elementary questions. As the president and CEO of the Africa-America Institute in New York, she graciously complied. She's winning and crisp, age 43, in the swim of the summit.
