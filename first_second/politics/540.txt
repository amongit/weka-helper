Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for failing to “defend our ambassador” during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack, saying this "preclude[s] her from even being considered for the higher office.”
“The biggest mistake Hillary Clinton made, and think this will be an albatross over her neck for the rest of the campaign, I don’t think she’ll be able to overcome this, is that when she was asked to provide security for Benghazi, she didn’t do it,” Paul said in an interview with Yahoo’s Katie Couric.
