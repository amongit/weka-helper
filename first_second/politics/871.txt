President Barack Obama is ending the year on a upswing.
The latest positive sign is that his job approval rating is higher than it's been since August 2013. The latest Gallup poll, conducted over the span of three days, Dec. 27-29, finds that 48 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, and 48 percent disapprove. Obama's job approval rating averaged only 44 percent last week; it had hovered at 42 percent for many months. "Some of this uptick is due to higher ratings among Hispanics, who reacted favorably to Obama's actions on immigration announced in November," said Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief. Newport was referring to Obama's decision to stop deporting millions of people who entered the United States illegally. "Some of it may reflect his recent announcement concerning the restoration of relations with Cuba," Newport added in an analysis released to reporters.
