Wednesday turned out to be pretty busy for the blogosphere. It was one of those days where, rather than being too little to write on, there was almost too much. Congress is gone, leaving a lot of business on the table, including the critically important issue of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act reauthorization. But it also accomplished a great deal by approving the so-called "cromnibus" that keeps federal discretionary spending on the downward trajectory that started with last year’s sequester.
The GOP claimed an additional congressional seat in Arizona as a state court determined that Republican Martha McSally had won a recount in the state’s 2nd congressional district. This gives the party its largest majority in the U.S. House of Representatives since the 1920s. So much for the analysis that the election of President Barack Obama marked the birth of a new and enduring liberal-left coalition that would realign American politics.
