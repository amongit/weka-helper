President Barack Obama got what he was hoping for when he announced a new policy to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation: a surge in support from Latinos, many of whom stand to benefit from the new initiative.
The latest Gallup poll finds that Obama's approval rating among Hispanics increased by 14 points, to 68 percent, during the past two weeks. During that time, Obama announced he was taking executive action on immigration and bypassing Congress, where Republicans have blocked his proposals.
