The Latino Victory Project hasn't decided whether to push for a Latino victory in the Chicago mayoral race.
The nonpartisan political action committee formed to help Latinos win election to local, state and federal offices told The Huffington Post that it hasn’t gotten involved in the Chicago race, where Jesus “Chuy” Garcia is running a campaign against incumbent Rahm Emanuel. Some in the national media have described the contest as one that's pitting the Democratic Party’s grassroots base against its establishment.
