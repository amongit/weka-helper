Fourteen years ago this week, on Dec. 13, 2000, George W. Bush declared victory as the 43rd president of the United States, 36 days after the November election.
In a head-to-head matchup with then-Vice President Al Gore (D), Bush was elected president "by one of the tightest margins in history, crowning a spectacular and exceptionally brisk political rise only eight years after his own father was turned out of the White House," The New York Times wrote in a piece this November.
