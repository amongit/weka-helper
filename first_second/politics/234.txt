Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's bid for reelection in an April runoff just got tougher.
On Thursday, the third-place finisher in the February election, Willie Wilson, endorsed Emanuel rival, Jesus "Chuy" Garcia. Wilson, a businessman who won slightly over 10 percent of the vote, is black and hopes to convert his supporters to Garcia's cause.
