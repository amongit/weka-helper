President Barack Obama is scheduled to leave Washington for Hawaii Friday to spend his annual Christmas vacation in the islands where he grew up. Criticism is sure to follow.
Presidents, regardless of party, tend to get pilloried for taking too much time off during their holidays. The political opposition has a tradition of saying the commander in chief goofs off when he leaves Washington because there is always important public business to be done. White House aides respond by saying a president can't escape his duties no matter where he is. They argue that he still receives official briefings and makes decisions, especially if a crisis occurs, so the commander in chief is never completely off the job.
