There are two new debt-ceiling-related surveys out this morning, one scientific and one anecdotal, and I'm not sure which is more depressing in terms of illustrating our national – and dangerous – ignorance.
First, take the latest polling data from United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, which shows that, as National Journal's Shane Goldmacher puts it, " Americans broadly do not understand how the debt ceiling works." Specifically, 62 percent of Americans believe that raising the debt ceiling means borrowing for "future expenditures" – it doesn't – while 28 percent believe it means "paying off debts [the federal government] has already accumulated," which is correct. That breaks down to 73 percent of Republicans, 62 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats not understanding the debt ceiling. At last, something that can bring the country together: blighted ignorance.
