An economic barometer known as the Misery Index shows the U.S. is in its best financial shape since May 1959.
The index, which is calculated by adding monthly inflationary and unemployment rates, dipped to 5.61 percent in January, marking a seventh consecutive month of decline. January's 5.7 percent unemployment rate and -0.09 percent inflation rate suggest that the country is in the least miserable economic situation it's seen in the better part of a century.
