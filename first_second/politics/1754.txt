Republican lawmakers opposing President Barack Obama's immigration actions risk alienating potential GOP supporters and may be jeopardizing the party's future, according to a study released Wednesday by the University of Southern California.
The USC Dornsife Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration evaluated the demographics of children whose parents would benefit from Obamaâ€™s expansion of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, which would allow parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for deportation deferrals and work permits. The program is part of Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration, which a Texas judge put on hold last month until he makes a permanent decision March 19.
