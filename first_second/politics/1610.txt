The following column is part of a series. For more, go to Liberal Zionists Speak Out.
Some people are born Zionists. Some achieve Zionism. And some have Zionism thrust upon them. Of the three, I think I'm primarily the native variety, as, on some level, I've been a Zionist all my life. Not that my parents were card-carrying Zionists (they weren't). Not that I ever attended a Zionist camp (I didn't). Nor did I read Hebrew novels (never have). Nor did I participate in a Zionist youth movement (except for a brief and marginal tie to Young Judaea in 1966). In fact, before May 1967, I never had a serious conversation about Israel.
