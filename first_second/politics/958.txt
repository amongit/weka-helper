The Christmas season is again upon us.
It is a time for bonhomie, glad tidings and good wishes, a time to share the joy that comes from being brothers and sisters created in the image of the author of the universe. It is not a time for division, insult and offense but, unfortunately, thatâ€™s what the so-called "War on Christmas" all too often brings.
