The world has witnessed several tragic events in recent months: ongoing violence by the extremist group ISIS in the Middle East and Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Charlie Hebdo shooting and hostage-taking at a kosher grocery store in suburban Paris on January 7th, and the desecration of the Sarre-Union Jewish cemetery in France on February 14th, among others. The vast majority of the American people have condemned these horrific acts and lamented the conditions in other countries that led to them.
Tragically, America is not immune from such violence. There have been a series of disturbing attacks against religious minorities lately: the beating of Sureshbhai Patel in Alabama on February 6th; the tragic murders of Yusor Mohammad Abu-Sal, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, and Deah Barakat in Chapel Hill on February 10th; the arson of the Quba Islamic Institute in Houston on February 13th; the Islamophobic defacement of the Islamic School of Rhode Island on February 14th; the anti-Hindu vandalism of the Hindu Temple Cultural Center in Bothell, Washington. When a hateful crime is committed against someone who practices Islam, Sikhism, Judaism, Hinduism, or Christianity, we must remember that the faiths themselves are not the victims--the religions do not become less important or lose their practitioners. The real victims of these crimes are just regular, everyday people. The victims are American.
