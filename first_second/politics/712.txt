Just over a third of people who have severe depression report having contact with a mental health professional during the past year, even though medication and therapy is known to be the most effective treatment against the condition, a new government report shows.
Released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the report looked at depression rates from 2009 to 2012, finding that percentages of treatment remain low, and that the treatment received often is inadequate. In collecting data, depressive symptoms were evaluated as lasting more than two weeks. According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 20 million people in the United States have depression. Its symptoms go beyond feeling sad for a few days, and interfere with people's daily lives, causing energy loss, feelings of worthlessness, problems with sleeping, or thoughts of death or suicide. It is considered a disorder of the brain that is due to a variety of causes, whether genetic, environmental, psychological or biochemical.
