President Barack Obama is scheduled to jump back into the pop culture world Thursday night with an interview on the quirky ABC show "Jimmy Kimmel Live."
It will be Obama's latest foray into the entertainment world as he continues to appear in venues that his predecessors disdained, such as on late-night comedy programs. Other presidents felt that appearing on such shows would have lowered the stature of their office. Obama doesn't.
