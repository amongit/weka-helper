On Thursday, House Democrats sought to apply the principle of “speak softly and carry a big stick” with Speaker John Boehner, urging him to put off an upcoming, highly controversial congressional speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu until after the deadline for the White House to reach a deal with Iran, Israel’s blood enemy.
Judging by the letter they sent to Boehner, the Democrats got the “speak softly” part just right: the letter expresses strong concern that, by making an end-run around President Barack Obama to invite Netanyahu, Boehner appears (“appears”?) to be using Netanyahu as the monkey wrench to throw into White House negotiations with Iran to curb Tehran’s appetite for a nuclear weapon.
