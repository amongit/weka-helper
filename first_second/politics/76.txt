Washington (CNN)Sen. Tom Cotton said he has "no regrets at all" about his controversial letter to Iranian leaders warning them that any nuclear deal they reach with President Barack Obama could be modified or abandoned by a future president and must be approved by Congress.
"In fact, if the president and the secretary of State were intent on driving a hard bargain, they would be able to point to this letter and say, 'They're right...any lasting deal needs to be approved by Congress,'" the Arkansas Republican said on CBS' "Face the Nation" this weekend.
