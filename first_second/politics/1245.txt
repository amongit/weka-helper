Day One of CPAC, the annual right-wing confab and Republican presidential cattle call, is in full swing, with about all you’d expect – grassroots right-wing activists, two rows of conservative-media chat-show booths, and a guy in Revolution-era garb and tricorn hat, toting a Gadsden flag (he’s a regular).
Like any large-scale conference, there are plenty of panel discussions, plenary sessions and breakouts. Judging by the titles and subjects, however, the Obama Era that brought Hope and Change on the left ushered in an era of Doom and Gloom on the right. There’s a lot of fear, paranoia and anger out here, and Big Government is (mostly) responsible.
