Republicans will try to find their footing anew on national security this week, looking to try to overcome last week’s ill-received letter to Iran’s leaders and instead focus on President Obama’s negotiations, and on Congress‘ role in approving whatever deal he strikes with Tehran.
Senate Republicans vehemently denied Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s claim that Congress won’t — and shouldn’t — have a role in a final agreement. A legal report last week said any lasting deal that includes the permanent lifting of sanctions will have to go through Congress.
