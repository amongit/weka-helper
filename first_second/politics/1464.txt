On Monday, February 16th, our nation will pause to celebrate President's Day and remember all the Presidents who served our nation. I would like to take this occasion to share an experience in which President Reagan (for whom I had not voted) taught me something powerful and lasting regarding the value -- and importance -- of loving (yes I mean loving) our country.
