My colleagues David Catanese and Gabrielle Levy are largely correct: The State of the Union address has lost its luster and relevance and I would be very surprised if the viewership totals don’t reflect that, to President Barack Obama’s undoubted dismay. But even a relatively trivialized address to the nation carries with it loads of, well, trivia. Here, with the aid of both U.C. Santa Barbara’s invaluable American Presidency Project and my own (also invaluable, really!) “ White House Ghosts: Presidents and Their Speechwriters” are some firsts, mosts and onlies regarding the nation’s annual political dog-and-pony show.
First “State of the Union” address: While George Washington had, not surprisingly, been the first president to deliver an annual report to Congress, it wasn’t until Franklin Roosevelt’s 1934 address that the speech was formally called a “State of the Union” address; prior to that it was simply the president’s annual message – and for a long time it wasn’t even spoken. Many people don’t realize it, but the Constitution mandates neither a speech nor a time-frame. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution mandates that the president “shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Washington set the practice all of his successors have followed, delivering the message annually. And both he and John Adams, our nation’s second president, gave their messages orally; but Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Adams, worried that lecturing Congress would seem too kingly and sent his messages over in writing, as did every president until Woodrow Wilson started making them speeches again in 1913. Overall, only 81 of 225 of these messages have been delivered as a speech, not including tonight’s.
