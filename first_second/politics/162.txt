Both the Democratic and Republican parties are below 40 percent favorability for the first time since Gallup started measuring the two partiesâ€™ images that way in 1992, a new survey said.
Favorability of the Republican party has dipped 5 points since just after the midterm elections last year to 37 percent, and the 39 percent favorability rating for the Democratic party is near a record low of 36 percent recorded just after the 2014 midterms.
