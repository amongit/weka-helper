@josephbraude - The following is a translation of my latest weekly column in Arabic, (Risalat New York), in the Moroccan daily Al-Ahdath al-Maghrebiya.
Reports emerged in the American media Thursday that President Obama may propose a resolution to the UN Security Council calling for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran, if an agreement is reached by the "P5+1" negotiating team over the country's nuclear program. The possibility angered members of the Republican Congress, who have been fiercely critical of the emerging Iranian deal, citing concerns that it will enable Iran to gradually achieve its nuclear aspirations, as well as free its hand to further empower its Shi'ite Islamist Arab proxies.
