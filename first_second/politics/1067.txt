We published a sharp op-ed yesterday by the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Matthew Rojansky on how what Ukraine fundamentally needs is to stand on its own and determine its own fate with a widespread, grassroots commitment to engage in representative democracy – that calls for “more proactive engagement from the United States and Europe … are well intentioned but not realistic.” Clearly the ceasefire compromise President Viktor Yanukovych signed is a step in the right direction. Rojansky makes good points and the piece is worth a read in full, but it also called to mind the extent to which the West has already quietly influenced Ukraine’s course. I’m not talking about diplomacy or aid, but straight politics.
U.S. political consultants have been involved in Ukrainian politics for years, including in the 2010 election that brought Yanukovych to power. In addition, both the pro-government and opposition parties in Ukraine have poured more cash into Washington hiring an battalion of D.C. lobbying firms to argue their cases over here.
