Texas Democrats weren’t too fond of a cake-eating celebration Republicans held to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the state’s same-sex marriage ban, so they responded this week with some treats of their own.
Last month, Texas Republicans held a cake-cutting ceremony with the conservative group Texas Values to commemorate Texas Faith and Family Day, along with the state's constitutional amendment against gay marriage, the Advocate reported. The dessert was a white and pink sheet cake decorated with the words "10th Anniversary of 2005 Marriage Act."
