I normally discuss women's issues here, but I have a different concern this time.
My failure to adequately manage my health, while putting in long hours to get my startup off the ground, landed me in the hospital three weeks ago. I'm fine now, I'm back to work, and I'm grateful for the doctors' care I received. But my experience was a wake-up call to how a prestigious medical institution can ignore one of the primary contributors to long-term health.
