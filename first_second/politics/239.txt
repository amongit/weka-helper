These are boom times for congressional caucuses—the groups lawmakers form to support an industry or cause. The number of officially registered "congressional member organizations" and informal analogues has mushroomed in recent decades, from roughly 100 in the early 1990s to 350 in the mid-2000s to 739 in the last Congress. And, as of then, no one belonged to more of them than Rep. Loretta Sanchez.
The Democrat from Orange County, California—who was unaware of her status until I called her office earlier this month—was a member of 140 caucuses by the close of last session, according to the Congressional Yellow Book, the directory of lawmakers and staff that I used to perform my unofficial tally of affiliations. Sanchez's legislative portfolio is heavy on foreign affairs, and to some extent, her memberships reflect that: For example, she tells me, she belongs to the caucus on Romania "because it's a NATO ally." Her geopolitical pursuits also explain her association with the Kurdish-American Caucus, the Korea Caucus, and the Friends of Scotland Caucus (which she cochairs out of interest in the cache of nuclear weapons there). In addition, she goes to weekly meetings of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. Other affiliations include the Wine Caucus (where members hear from the industry while tasting its Pinots and Cabernets), the Oral Health Caucus (dedicated to dental research, and, of course, flossing), and the Electromagnetic Pulse Caucus (which raises awareness about the risk of an infrastructure apocalypse). The Diabetes Caucus—the most popular of the groups on the Hill—counts Sanchez among its 316 members, as does the Women in the Military Caucus, which she founded. In general, if a colleague approaches her, Sanchez says, "I'm like, 'Oh, yeah. Yeah, put me on that caucus—it just meets once a year.' "
