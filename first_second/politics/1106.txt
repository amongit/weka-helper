I have to admit that the conservative narrative regarding Obamacare has got me a little bit confused. The problem is that the critics of the Affordable Care Act keep making contradictory arguments about the law.
So we learned yesterday from Heritage Foundation chieftain Jim DeMint that, in his view, President Obama's comfortable re-election can't be seen as the electorate signaling acceptance of the law. DeMint essentially said voters didn't know what they were doing when they re-elected Obama. "Because of Romney and Romneycare, we did not litigate the Obamacare issue," DeMint told Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green. Never mind that GOP nominee Mitt Romney talked about repealing Obamacare at virtually every opportunity and even ran ads promising to do so on his first day in office.
