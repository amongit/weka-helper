Washington (CNN)Senate Republican leaders ditched plans Thursday to take up a bill next week that would have given Congress an up-or-down vote on any agreement international negotiators -- led by the United States -- make with Iran on its nuclear program, an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN.
The move comes after Democrats, who were upset GOP leaders decided to fast-track the legislation, threatened to block taking up the bill. Democrats fear immediate consideration could disrupt the sensitive talks with Iran that face an important March 24 deadline.
