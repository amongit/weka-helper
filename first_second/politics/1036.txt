One hundred years ago this week – on July 11, 1914 to be precise – a 19-year old rookie made his major league debut for the Boston Red Sox, pitching seven strong innings for the win over the Cleveland Indians in front of a scant Fenway Park crowd. “He has natural delivery, great command and a curve ball that is tough for opposing hitters,” the Boston Globe’s T.H. Murname wrote in the next day’s edition. “However, there’s still room for improvement for him but he will undoubtedly progress with the help of Manager Bill Carrigan.”
This was an understatement: The pitcher’s name was George Herman “Babe” Ruth. But you wouldn’t know that centennial is approaching, as Major League Baseball is whiffing on a big opportunity to honor its own history and, oh yeah, market itself.
