AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Maine’s future governor and lawmakers could get a pay boost under a bill before the Legislature.
The State and Local Government Committee will hold a public hearing on Democratic Rep. John Martin’s bill on Monday. It would increase the governor’s salary in 2019 from $70,000 a year to $120,000 a year. Lawmakers’ salaries would also go up from about $24,000 over two years to $41,000.
