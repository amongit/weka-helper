As I noted in my exhaustive "State of the Union" trivia roundup, the tradition of a responding speech has evolved from a group of opposition party leaders giving a unified response to the president to a group of individuals giving numerous uncoordinated responses. If, like my bloleague Peter Fenn, you don't like this trend, get used to it – it only figures to get worse.
For the fourth year running there will not only be an official GOP response (from Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers) but also an "official" – as official as is possible for a movement without a single formal organization – tea party response (from Utah Sen. Mike Lee), not to mention an official Rand Paul response (from, you guessed it, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul).
