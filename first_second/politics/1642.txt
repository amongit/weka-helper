As much as I typically disagree with the Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass, his description of Chicago as a "City of Tribes" is apt. I grew up in a small town, Woodstock, Ill., that was mostly homogenous and people had differences, but the commonalities ruled the day.
In Chicago, you can easily identify with five or more groups, whether you like it or not. Your race, ethnicity, income, neighborhood, school and block. I live in an area where I can associate with three different neighborhoods, each having their own festival. In the neighborhood where I work, personal identities can fracture 10 different ways, from the street to the block.
