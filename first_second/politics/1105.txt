There will be, among my media colleagues, an instinct to blame the current government shutdown on both sides. A pox on both their houses is popular because it's easy – everyone's to blame for gridlock, so we're not blaming anyone! – and attracts fewer charges of media bias. The double pox caucus likes to strike a post-partisan pose because it gives them a sense of superior enlightenment; they get the joke of the two party system, they think, in a way that grubby true believers don't.
Don't buy it. Both sides aren't to blame. The GOP – specifically the fringe right that is currently calling the party's shots – craved this shutdown and owns it.
