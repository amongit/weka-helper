The Independent Women’s Forum yesterday released a poll reinforcing what had – with good reason – already become conventional wisdom: that Sen. Thad Cochran held onto the GOP nomination for his seat because African-American voters crossed party lines and saved him.
Cochran’s opponent, state Sen. Chris McDaniel was, of course, the first person to suggest this, thundering against “liberal Democrats” in his concession speech and repeatedly warning that he wants to “be absolutely certain that our Republican primary was won by Republican voters.”
