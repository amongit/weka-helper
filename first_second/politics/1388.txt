This past week the U.S. House of Representatives' Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), released a document titled "Fairness in Tax Policy." Not surprisingly, conservative pundits like Forbes contributor Robert W. Wood fell all over themselves to misrepresent the information in this document with statements like "The 1% Makes 19% Of All Income, Pays 49% Of All Taxes."
The reality is that this number is just a projection for 2015 tax returns, not the actual data. According to a Fox News op-ed, the most recent release by the IRS shows the top 1 percent making 19 percent of the adjusted gross income while paying 35 percent of the taxes.
