Nicole Hemmer has a typically thoughtful post up on the Jeb Bush presidential boomlet, putting the immigration debate into historical context and teasing out the philosophical implications of Bush’s comments on the matter. It’s a smart piece and worth a read in full. But I have to quibble with one comment she makes. She writes:
She’s absolutely right in a sense: America isn’t an aristocracy, and for that reason neither Jeb Bush’s nor Hillary Clinton’s pedigrees give them special claims to the Oval Office. But by the same token neither should their last names raise special barriers for them.
