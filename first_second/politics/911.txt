Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is doing everything possible to pave the way for a presidential run in 2016 short of actually announcing her candidacy, and fellow Democrats mostly like what they see.
When Clinton started doing more campaign-like events earlier this year, she seemed rusty and off her game. Now she is showing considerable skill on the stump, and she is putting it to good use in urging support for Democratic candidates across the country. She made an enthusiastic pitch for women's votes in Colorado this week, arguing that Democrats are pushing for pay equality and making other efforts to help women while Republicans are blocking such moves. And she said Democrats have Middle America's interests at heart. "We need votes for people who believe in you, who worry about you and do everything in their power to give you and your families opportunities," she told a Democratic crowd in Aurora, Colorado.
