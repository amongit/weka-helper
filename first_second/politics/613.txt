President Obama's decision to cut short his historic trip to India in January to fly to Saudi Arabia can be attributed to two reasons. The first involves diplomatic courtesy and international respect: paying our nation's respects upon the passing of 90-year-old Saudi King Abdullah, cherished ally in times of turmoil in the Middle East.
The other reason involves an increasingly hazy future in the Middle East: cementing ties with King Abdullah's successor and half-brother, Salman bin Abdul Aziz. The urgency of the Obama visit reflects not only the sprawling region's chaotic state -- instability in Yemen, Iran's ongoing negotiations with the West, conquest by ISIS, civil war in Syria, upheavals in Libya and Egypt -- but court intrigue as King Salman manages a crisis of succession.
