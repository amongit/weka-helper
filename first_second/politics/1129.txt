Ben Carson, the African-American neurosurgeon who has never held public office, on Tuesday became the second major Republican to form a presidential exploratory committee.
“I’ve decided to explore a potential run for the office of president because I believe my values, life experience, and willingness to speak the truth and seek solutions, prepares me well to lead our nation toward more prosperity, security, and freedom for every American,” Carson wrote in a statement to his supporters.
