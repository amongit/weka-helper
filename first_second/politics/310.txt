If there's one thing that lawmakers like to talk about, it's flying. They do it a lot, and like the rest of the public, they all have war stories of inconveniences. This will make for a fun scene as the acting administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, Melvin Carraway, appears before the Senate Commerce Committee's Aviation Subcommittee to testify this week.
The committee is examining TSA's Pre-Check program, designed to allow travelers who have paid a fee and passed a background check to bypass some screening steps like removing shoes before passing through a metal detector. Pre-Check passengers also have dedicated lines for TSA screening, speeding up what most people consider the most tedious part of the airport experience. What's not to like?
