By attempting to repeal President Obama's executive action through both the courts and the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, Republicans are taking the wrong approach to immigration reform. While these actions have spurred immense political debate, grassroots supporters and detractors and Sunday talk show fodder, it has also fueled harmful court cases and led Republicans to clog the pipeline of legislation in an already inactive Congress. The time has come for the political theatre to stop and for both sides to come to a bipartisan solution that leaves the President's executive actions in place.
In November, the Latino Victory Project applauded President Obama's decision to provide the opportunity for millions of Latinos and their families to come out of the shadows. The sensible fixes outlined in his executive action include laudable efforts to allow immigrants to stay in the country, contribute the economy and have access to a good education and a shot at the American dream. Yet following the President's announcement, the national dialogue on immigration reform began to spin out of control. Without a clear vision forward, many Republican state and federal officials chose to support unhelpful actions that only move our country backward. Look no further than a suit out of Texas. In what seems more like a political statement than a significant attempt at real reform, Governor Greg Abbott is leading a coalition of 26 states in a suit against President Obama and his plan to expand the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals plan (DACA). Latinos will remember the officials with large Latino populations in states like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Texas who are supporting action that could result in millions of immigrants being forced back into hiding and states losing out on millions of dollars in tax revenue.
