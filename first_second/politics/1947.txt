As I write this, the UK looks certain to proceed with a hung parliament; no clear result has emerged from the election.
As parties scratch around to make uneasy coalitions and alliances, I believe that green jobs and technology could provide a unifying theme that will draw together uneasy political allies - and benefit the UK in the long run. It would be a good news story in a sea of gloom; and could lead to talk of an economic revival.
