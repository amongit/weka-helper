Boris Nemtsov has been dead for less than three days. During this time, the media and blogsosphere have understandably gone into overdrive in the attempt to figure out exactly what happened. Journalists are trained to answer the key questions "who, what, when, where, how, and why", but the most important ones in this case (who and why) are obviously at the center of the most intense speculation.
We will never really know.
