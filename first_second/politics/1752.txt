WASHINGTON -- As a lawsuit from 26 states continues to stall President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, officials from other states are becoming increasingly fiery in the president's defense.
California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) told reporters on Friday that the states that sued the federal government to halt relief for undocumented immigrants are "declaring war" on those immigrants and the people who support them.
