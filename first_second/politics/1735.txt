It's not the first time ISIL has released a video featuring their now trademark brutality and disregard for human life. Each one has left us more breathless in horror and disbelief than the last--and the thought that we haven't seen the final one is desperately tragic. "Savages" we whisper to ourselves when our breath begins to return. And we are right. They lined 21 young men in bright orange jumpsuits against the organic line of a blue coast with the aesthetic precision of a Christo and Jean-Claude installation and summarily beheaded each and every of them. These are savages. That word gets a lot of second-guessing these days--and often for good reason--but that doesn't mean it's never appropriate. Of course it's appropriate; at times like this, it's the only word we can physiologically voice.
There is an argument that we shouldn't call them Savages or Extremists or any of our lexicon's most heinous descriptors because it only encourages them. These savages, the logic goes, take great pride in being savages, and having their savagery called out as such is a kind of accomplishment or reward. I don't know. That may be true, but, in our hearts, we know real savagery when we see it.
