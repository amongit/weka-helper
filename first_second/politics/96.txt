Washington (CNN)House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz will likely send the State Department a letter on Friday requesting former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton's emails, and could subpoena them if necessary.
"Subpoenaing Hillary Clinton is not the chairman's initial preference but the committee retains the authority to do so if necessary," Chaffetz spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin told CNN.
