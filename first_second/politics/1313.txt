To Beltway insiders, John Podesta needs no introduction; when two presidents -- and a woman who wants to be the next one -- know your name, everyone else in this town probably does, too.

To anyone who’s Ready For Hillary, the news that a heavyweight, dyed-in-the-wool Clintonista was coming aboard might as well have been her "I'm running" campaign announcement.
