The London–based Legatum Institute came to Washington with a mission: To show the city of think tanks how it's done – not just differently, but in a way that soars out of the paradigm.
Arts and culture are the components the Legatum Institute adds to the usual array of think tank topics, in a rigorous yet exuberant spirit. In a gorgeous choral concert at the Washington National Cathedral yesterday, a newly commissioned work by the English composer, Sir John Tavener, had its world premiere– and guess what? There was Sir John himself to hear his "Three Hymns of George Herbert," performed for the first time by the City Choir of Washington.
