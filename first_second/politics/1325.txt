President Barack Obama made some progress on his agenda in his passage to India. But events in the Middle East and Washington demonstrated again how hamstrung his administration continues to be.
With Republicans stronger in Congress now than they have been since the first election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, Obama's domestic utterances are important mainly for how they help frame the 2016 elections Which makes Obama's geopolitical agenda and international travels and statements all the more important for his remaining presidency.
