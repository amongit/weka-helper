ANDERSON, S.C. — Marco Rubio seemed to sense his speech to a gathering of conservative activists would lure detractors. So like any smart politician, he sought to preempt their plot with a dash of humor.
“If there are any hecklers here tonight, if you could wait until about 10 minutes into the speech, because that’ll give me time to go for water,” quipped the freshman Republican Florida senator, invoking memories of his now famed grab for a water bottle that took him jarringly out of the television frame during his 2013 State of the Union response.
