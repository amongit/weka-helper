Each year at this time we celebrate the births of two of our nation's greatest leaders, Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. The points of similarity and difference between them are many and obvious. One was known as the father of his country and led an inexperienced army to an unexpected victory against the foremost military power in the world; the other was a kind of second father, leading the nation through a war of unprecedented devastation that brought about what he famously called a "new birth of freedom." Yet one is credited with the end of slavery; the other owned slaves, even though he wished and planned to free them.
This year, I want to offer a different comparison -- not between Washington and Lincoln but between Washington and a more recent father of his nation: the late Nelson Mandela. This time, the points of contrast are especially obvious, even glaring. George Washington belonged to a landed gentry that depended for its wealth on the uncompensated labor of Africans brought to his country through a massive and horrific system of abduction, imprisonment, and forced transportation; Nelson Mandela, a proud descendant of African royalty, spent much of his life in prison for his role in a decades-long struggle to overturn the legal and economic imprisonment of those who shared his heritage. Yet both were leaders of liberation movements that eventually prevailed against daunting odds, giving birth in each case to a new democracy that, for all the turbulence and uncertainty of its beginnings, would stand as a model for other nations to emulate.
