(CNN)Four in 10 Americans say race relations in the United States have gotten worse under the nation's first black president, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. And 50 years after the Bloody Sunday march marked a turning point in the civil rights movement, many still see discrimination in the nation's voting practices and criminal justice system.
As Barack Obama prepares to mark the march's anniversary in Selma, Alabama, 39% of Americans say relations between blacks and whites have worsened since he took office, including 45% of whites and 26% of blacks. Just 15% of Americans say race relations have improved under Obama, while 45% say they have stayed about the same.
