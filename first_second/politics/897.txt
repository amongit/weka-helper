President Barack Obama has denied that his controversial health care law was falsely presented to the public in order to insure its passage, as congressional Republicans expressed outrage at the deceptions described by a former academic adviser to the administration.
"The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run," Obama said.
