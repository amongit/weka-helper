Nearly half of Republicans want their party to move farther to the right, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. Democrats mostly want their party to stay the same.
Forty-six percent of Americans who either identify as Republicans or lean toward the party said they'd like the GOP and its candidates to become more conservative, while 32 percent said it should stay the same.
