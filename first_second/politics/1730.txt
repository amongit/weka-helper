Walking the halls of Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma, Alabama history surrounds you. Each step is a living testament to the miraculous work that happened here 50 years ago. There is the hallway of photos honoring local heros that marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday. In the sanctuary there is a plaque naming the martyrs -- Jonathan M. Daniels, Jimmy Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo, and James J. Reeb -- who gave their lives fighting for the voting rights of African Americans in 1965.
