Those who avidly follow politics always seek clarity and understanding, simply to figure out what is likely to happen. At this point, at least on the Republican side, we're all going to have to accept that this presidential nomination fight is going last a very long time with no clarity on the horizon.
Despite the best efforts of Republican National Committee members and Chairman Reince Priebus to shorten a process that just about everyone acknowledged went way too long in 2012, this contest is likely to go very long as well. It may not take on the appearance of The Gong Show—the wacky late-1970's TV game show populated by contestants with dubious, if any, talent—as much as 2012 did, but it is very difficult to see anyone emerging early as a clear favorite for the Republican nomination.
