Now that we've managed to – again – reset the clock on the economic time bomb known as the debt ceiling, how about defusing it entirely? Let's get rid of the thing, or at the very least rewire it so that an explosion must come from action rather than inaction.
Debt ceiling proponents say that it has the virtue of requiring the country to assess and earnestly discuss our fiscal situation. But most economists agree that failing to raise the debt ceiling would have catastrophic consequences. So the "conversation" logic is akin to saying that keeping a ticking firebomb in your house is a good idea because the occasion of pushing back the time it will explode forces you to have serious discussions about fire safety.
