With his latest trip to New Hampshire on Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is now knotted with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for conducting the most travel to early presidential nominating states over the past two years.
Each freshman GOP senator has made a total of 16 trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to the U.S. News Presidential Tracker. It's a leading signal that both Paul and Cruz will wage 2016 presidential bids.
