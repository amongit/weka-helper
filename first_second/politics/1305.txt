Like most landmark cases, the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision evoked a strong reaction to the politically astute: protesters disrupted the high court’s Wednesday session, more than a few pundits condemned the decision in online think-pieces and the hashtag #CitizensUnited verged on going viral -- and not in a good way.
Even President Barack Obama -- who on Tuesday bashed the decision in his State of the Union speech, with the justices in the front row -- took another swing in a press release Wednesday. The Citizens United decision, according to the statement, “was wrong, and it has caused real harm to our democracy. With each new campaign season, this dark money floods our airwaves with more and more political ads that pull our politics into the gutter. It’s time to reverse this trend.”
