Singapore celebrates 50 years of independence this year. In that half-a-century, the country has made significant progress especially on the economic front.
In the past, the economic prowess of the country was attributed to a highly disciplined workforce, aided by a populace that (purportedly) preferred economic growth over democratic rights, and enabled by a no-nonsense, autocratic style of governance. Ironically, such a regimented approach is undoing much of what has been accomplished.
