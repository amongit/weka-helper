It's such a disappointment when our favorite writer or entertainer says or does something that not only disappoints or confuses us, but offends us. His or her personal philosophy shouldn't enter into it, but it does. Intellectually, we know we shouldn't mix the artistic with the personal, but we do it anyway.
Take the playwright David Mamet, for example. His stage plays and Hollywood screenplays are absolutely brilliant. He's a genius. Say what you will about his material being "too masculine" or "sexist," there's no denying the man knows how to put together a script. He's a master of his craft. I'm an unabashed fan and admirer.
