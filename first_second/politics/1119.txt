Well, the good news is that we're not on the verge of restarting the Cold War. The bad news, no surprise, is that U.S. relations with Russia are "tenser than usual," and "not in good shape." All of this according to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Meeting with reporters and other foreign policy experts at the Center for the National Interest this morning, Kislyak said that while he's concerned that U.S.-Russia relations "are not in good shape, I'm concerned about where they are going, but certainly I am still of the opinion that there is no basis for Cold War resumption."
