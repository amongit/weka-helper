WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Monday that President Barack Obama's major failure in office has been an inability to recognize quickly enough that congressional Republicans were never good-faith partners in governance.
"If you were to ask me what his major mistake has been, it's that he thought that after putting together this extraordinary grassroots movement of young people, minorities and working-class people and getting elected to the presidency, then he thought he could sit down with the Republicans and negotiate all these agreements. He was mistaken," Sanders told a gathering at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
