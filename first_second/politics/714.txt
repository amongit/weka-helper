Key markets to watch in 2015 for robust housing activity are mostly on the East Coast, the South and the West Coast, according to projections released Wednesday from real estate firm Trulia. And in those metro areas, post-recession investor behavior no longer drives growth; rather, Trulia says, it’s the healthier labor market, especially for young adults.
Trulia’s top 10 markets – which include Boston, Dallas and Fresno, California – have strong "fundamentals" that will stimulate housing activity, including strong job growth, which drives housing demand, and low vacancy rates, which in turn encourages more construction.
