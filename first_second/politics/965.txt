As unhappy as some people may be about the grand jury’s decision in the Michael Brown case, there is absolutely no excuse for those who have chosen to riot, to burn, to loot and to otherwise destroy businesses.
Given an enormous push from the media – and almost no prior sanction from national or state political officials – those who burned down two auto parts stores and other commercial establishments did so with all the zeal of college students lighting a bonfire before the big game. They weren’t articulating their rage; they were having fun.
