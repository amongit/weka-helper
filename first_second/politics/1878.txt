The modern United States is less hopeful than ever. We live in a time when cynicism about government is at an all-time high, when lack of trust in our most sacred institutions is the norm rather than the exception. Our knowledge has made us wary of politics; our modern pace of life has made us hard and unkind. Charlie Chaplin's famous quote -- that "we think too much and feel too little" -- rings true now more than ever. Every day we are told to reason, to think, to be rational; this is at the heart of what our nation's elite universities teach future leaders: Be rational and -- troublingly -- use your head, not your heart. Behind these flawed exhortations is another: Be realistic; do not hope for anything better. Emotional thought and rational thought are perceived as incompatible.
This cynicism is problematic -- not only because of its inaccuracy, but also because it is contrary to the philosophy that made America great. It is the sort of perspective a country adopts when it has lost its vigor and resigned itself to decline. No leader has ever inspired by speaking only to the mind. No one has ever felt with his fellow man without using his heart. Our unique American history has been marked by visionaries who used reason and passion in tandem -- reason like the tiller that guides a sailboat's course, passion like the wind that propels it forward. Although reason can reveal the means to an end, it cannot motivate us to get there.
