Americans, tired of the winter cold, will have an easier time vacationing in warmer climates in 2015 thanks to strong jobs growth, dropping oil prices and moves by regulators in the U.S. and Europe that may continue the dollarâ€™s rising value against the euro.
The U.S. dollar on Friday was worth 0.84 euros, a rise in the exchange rate compared with a value of 0.73 euros on the same day in 2014, giving Americans more spending power when they travel to Europe. That trend is likely to continue in 2015, and is quite a reversal of fortunes for the euro that once enjoyed a much higher value against the dollar, says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
