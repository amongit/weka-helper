New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential aspirations were badly damaged by the misconduct of aides who thought it would be a neat idea to close the approaches to the George Washington Bridge in order to teach a lesson to a local elected official who wouldn’t play ball during Christie's re-election bid.
Though the story has died down it hasn’t completely gone away. It remains a point on which Christie (who is also head of the Republican Governors’ Association) is vulnerable – as New York‘s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Westchester County executive Rob Astorino, reminded everyone earlier this week.
