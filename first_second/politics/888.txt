President Barack Obama is under increasing pressure to take more aggressive actions aimed at helping African Americans, especially in dealing with police, but so far he is adopting an incremental approach.
A case in point came at his meetings at the White House Monday with civil-rights leaders, law enforcement officers and others. The sessions were designed to be the president's response to the rioting and anger that followed a recent grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri not to indict a white police officer for killing an unarmed African American teenager last summer.
