Americans have traditionally been optimistic about the future and confident in their ability to succeed. Today, not so much.
Sixty-four percent of Americans still believe in the American dream, but that's the lowest level in two decades, according to the latest New York Times poll. Even during the financial crisis of 2009, 72 percent of Americans still believed that hard work could result in financial success. More than 80 percent believed in the American dream in 2011 and 2000.
