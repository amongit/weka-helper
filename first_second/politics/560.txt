On November 26, a group of Venezuela's State Political Police (SEBIN) came to the private home of pro-democracy campaigner Maria Corina Machado to inform her that she was going to be charged with conspiring to assassinate thep of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. The penalty, if found guilty, would be a maximum of 28 years in prison.
Yet this was only the culmination of a several months' long campaign against Machado. She was first alleged to have planned to kill the president and carry off a coup d'Ã©tat by the "High Political Command of the Revolution," a group of five top political associates of Maduro, during a national television broadcast on May 28. During that same broadcast, Machado's personal email address and phone number were also made public -- a gross violation of privacy, and a clear incitement to violence. Indeed, she has received numerous death threats since, as have the rest of her family.
