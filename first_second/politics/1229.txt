For a party that says it wants to sing in harmony with minorities, Republicans have shown a knack for hitting the wrong notes, especially with African-Americans. Add this weekend’s events in Selma, Alabama, to the list of tone-deaf GOP performances.

Bush and more than two dozen lawmakers will be at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, commemorating an important civil rights American history milestone, the GOP’s entire Capitol Hill leadership team – including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy – decided to skip it.
