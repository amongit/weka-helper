The dominant political story of the 2014 cycle has been the battle for control of the United States Senate because, like football, it’s compelling and at the same time easy to explain. Reporters covering Senate races don’t have to know too much about policy questions, voter blocs or election history to write about who is ahead, who is behind and how it all adds up in each party’s effort to get to 51 seats.
This means, of course, that other races that should get attention don’t. In particular, there are three gubernatorial contests where the Democrats and their allies in the public employee unions and so-called social welfare organizations are out for blood because failure means the eventual destruction of their political coalition.
