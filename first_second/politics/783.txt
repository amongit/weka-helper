The new book with all the buzz is "Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House," by Peter Baker. It is a magisterial study of the way these men influenced each other, waxing and then waning, during the fateful eight-year presidency of George W. Bush.
Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, does not miss much about Bush in 653 pages, down to his dog Spot's death. Bush took it hard. Baker paints a nuanced and sympathetic portrait of the 43rd president, which I came to appreciate as I turned the pages.
