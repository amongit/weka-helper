No 2016 presidential hopeful has had a better two-week run than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
He made them swoon in Iowa. He slung-shot to the top of a caucus poll there. He's signing up staff at a swift clip. He's dominating Beltway buzz. Taken together, this surge will boost his immediate fundraising efforts and elevate his profile, opening doors of support that would've been tough to crack before.
