WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State John Kerry told lawmakers Wednesday that if they can't pass President Barack Obama's war authorization request with a broad, bipartisan vote, it's better that they don't pass one at all.
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry was asked about the usefulness of Congress passing an Authorization for Use of Military Force if it only has GOP votes. As it stands, neither party is thrilled with the president's proposal for fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also called ISIS. But Republicans control both chambers, so they are tasked with moving it forward.
