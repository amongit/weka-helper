President Barack Obama has found another way to infuriate his Republican opponents in Congress. This time, it's his plan to declare 12 million acres of public land in Alaska off limits to development, including oil and gas production.
Environmentalists and some liberal-oriented organizations such as the Center for American Progress hailed the decision, but it prompted a furious response from Alaska legislators led by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Republican chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She said Monday that the Obama administration "had effectively declared war on Alaska" and would damage the state's oil-dependent economy. She added in a statement: "It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory ... I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska. But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal."
