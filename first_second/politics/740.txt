Good pick, Mr. President. Ron Klain, designated as the new Ebola czar by President Barack Obama, is the right man for the job. In a White House of breaking bad news, this "Master of Disaster" appointment showed some hardheaded sense.
Yes, there are grumbles from the usual Republican suspects that Klain has no medical knowledge, and I say unto them: Who cares? He'll have people with M.D.s for the expertise he needs to stop this fatal beast in its tracks. Reality is one thing, and public perception is another. And yes, sometimes style matters as much as substance in our city on a hill.
