The Obama administration's college ratings proposal has riled the higher education community since it was announced in 2013, generating a backlash that has grabbed headlines for months. But most high school and college students are unaware the plan even exists, a new survey shows.
Fewer than 1 in 7 high school or college students — 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively — said they had heard of the administration's plan to rate colleges on measures of affordability, quality and access, the online textbook rental company Chegg found in a survey released Wednesday. Chegg surveyed 922 college students attending two-year and four-year schools and 446 high school students.
