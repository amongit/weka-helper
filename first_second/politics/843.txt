Official Washington is debating the use of force against Islamic extremists, but most Americans are still befuddled about exactly how President Barack Obama plans to defeat these violent, ruthless fighters in the Mideast and around the world.
Seventy-three percent of voters say the White House doesn't have a clear strategy for defeating the Islamic extremists, known as ISIS, an increase from 64 percent who felt that way last September, according to the latest Fox News poll. Only 19 percent of voters believe Obama has a clear plan for defeating ISIS, down from 26 percent in September.
