A lot of people are giggling and guffawing over the information made public by the recent hack of the computers at Sony Pictures. The view of Hollywood “beneath the tinsel” has exposed some remarkably un-politically correct sentiments emanating from some of the rich and power inhabitants of the nation’s PC capital.
It’s all well and good to poke fun at studio executives who may now be in fear for their jobs because of private thoughts they shared about the president of the United States, bankable box office stars and other aspects of life in “Washington on the West Coast.” Except that what happened at Sony goes much farther than that.
