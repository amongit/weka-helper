Amy Webb, you're no Elizabeth Bennet.
In a world of woe, Amy Webb's Internet dating fraud will not make it into the State of the Union address tonight. But she is a creature of the culture, a ruthless character that would make Jane Austen drop her pen if she only knew how far our fall is since the novel Pride and Prejudice was published 200 years ago. You see, Austen's favorite heroine Elizabeth Bennet actually has to compete as she is for Mr. Darcyâ€”Fitzwilliam to his closest friends.

Her bright spirit and confession that she dearly loves to laugh, combined with "a pair of fine eyes," as he himself put it, proved matchless.
