For some out to prove a point, America is a fundamentally perhaps even fatally flawed concept that cannot be redeemed. To them the country we are today – this citadel of freedom and democracy – was stolen from the people already on the continent when the Europeans first arrived and brought to economic greatness on the backs of black slaves.
That this is a severely distorted, even one-sided view of history that ignores very real, sometimes unpleasant truths that those who want to rechristen the holiday just celebrated as “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” –as Seattle and Minneapolis, for example, have – choose to ignore.
