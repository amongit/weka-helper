"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. MY promise... is to help you and your family." - Mitt Romney, acceptance speech.
That line from Mitt Romney's acceptance speech has been gnawing at me. It implies a false choice -- worse, a choice that Romney has never believed in himself. It suggests that the American present can only thrive at the expense of the American future. But it also violates every lesson about the environment in the conservative message manual. Recall most spectacularly Frank Luntz, who told Republicans, "Assure the public of your values and intentions. Use strong, active words: 'preserving and protecting'."
