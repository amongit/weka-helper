So sorry, Rolling Stone has brought journalism to a hard pass: how to cover stories of rape, especially those that happen on college campuses? The magazine's sensational account of a gang rape scene at a fraternity house crumbled under close scrutiny. The story relied on the alleged victim identified only as "Jackie." The writer did not contact any of the young men that she accused as her attackers. The case never went to court. The editors apologized (twice) for poor journalistic judgment after they concluded (too late) that Jackie's account was not credible.
But look at it this way. Even with its flaws, her story struck a chord. As Julia Horowitz, the assistant managing editor of The Cavalier Daily, wrote in Politico Magazine: "Yes, the story was sensational. But even the most sensational story, it seems, can contain frightening elements of truth." As badly as the editors botched this story, the sense of urgency over sexual assault was and is real. The time is right and ripe to confront and perhaps change the fusty way journalists handle sexual assault. There is a mounting sense of crisis among young people, a churn and a debate that we in the news profession need to keep up with. Sexual assault is also high in the military, which recorded roughly 19,000 reports this year, a decrease from a whopping 26,000 in 2012. Many of these cases involve young women as well who may feel reluctant, deployed in a fort far from home or out on a ship, to report an abuser, especially if he's in her chain of command.
