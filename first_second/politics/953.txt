In the 1980’s, the soundbite set liked to say that “one man’s terrorist was another man’s freedom fighter.” At the time, rebel groups on the left and right were being used to play out a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The inference, of course, is that the groups were morally equivalent as to tactics even if they differed in their objectives.
Various conflicts, political and otherwise, have emerged in the decades since the Berlin Wall finally came down. The debate about what constitutes a terrorist is being revived, especially in the context of establishing “legitimacy.” It’s not just North Korean-sponsored hackers who are stepping up their efforts to destabilize the global status quo; non-governmental actors like terrorists groups are just as busy.
