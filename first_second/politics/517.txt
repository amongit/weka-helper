Former Massachusetts governor and 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney (R) said President Barack Obama could boost former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's chances in the 2016 election if he strikes a nuclear deal with Iran.
In a USA Today op-ed published Friday, Romney expressed his disapproval for a potential deal, but said a deal would appear to be a "political home run."
