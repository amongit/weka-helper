To put a negative story about her private email account behind her, Hillary Clinton did what most highly-skilled, well-disciplined and battle-tested politicians do in situations that require damage control: she summoned the media, presented her script, and then stuck to it.
Clinton, taking on her first live-fire, no-softballs press conference in at least two years, told reporters in New York that she set up a private email account, and used it for official State Department business, “for convenience,” mostly to avoid carrying two smartphones: one for work and another for her personal communications.
