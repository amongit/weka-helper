As to the ongoing troubles in Ferguson, Missouri – part of an area more commonly referred to by residents as simply “North County” – something seems to be missing from the equation.
First, we have the interaction of an unarmed black teen with a white police officer that ended in a fatality.

The police officer, identified as Darren Wilson, may have used excessive force and may be totally responsible for the death of an innocent man.
