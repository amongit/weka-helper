Hillary Clinton is putting together an economic message for the presidential campaign of 2016, and it's turning out to be a distinctively Clintonian brand of quasi-populism.
Many liberal activists have been urging Clinton to take a more aggressive, confrontational approach by damning the rich and big corporations--a message popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Warren says the nation's economy is rigged against the middle class. She is being urged to run for president as a passionate populist but has declined so far.
