On his “The Fix” blog yesterday, the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza noted that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has been “purposely poking the Republican base in the eye,” and wondered why. Chris produces three sound reasons, but I think there’s a fourth he’s missing: that Bush is positioning himself for a 2016 presidential run as the GOP establishment candidate.
Cillizza notes that over the weekend Bush had deliberately described some illegal immigration as “an act of love,” and had previously defended the Common Core education standards. These aren’t gaffes, Chris concludes, but deliberate jabs at the tea party base on issues that wind them up. He offers three possible reasons: genuine belief on Bush’s part; that the comments are trial balloons designed to measure what he can get away with in a GOP primary; and that they are attempts at inoculation, making his positions on controversial (on the right) issues known so that they’ll be old news come primary time.
