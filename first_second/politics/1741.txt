With the presidential election looming on February 14, Nigeria is at a crossroads.
The outcome of the election will have serious implications both for the country itself and for how it is viewed around the world. This election is taking place at a very difficult time, when after almost 14 years of rule by the country's dominant party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria faces frightening challenges on many fronts: the recent precipitous decline in oil revenue, the growing lack of confidence by the general public, and the ongoing menace of the militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
