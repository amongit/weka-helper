Americans say the relationship between President Obama and Congress was more frayed than usual in 2013â€”and, if anything, only likely to get worse next year.
The first year of Obama's second term has been marked by a government shutdown, no significant legislative achievements, and incessant bickering between the administration and Capitol Hill, prompting 57 percent of Americans to say the White House and Congress are cooperating less than usual, according to the latest United Technologies/ Congressional Connection Poll.
