Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri does not regret signing the open letter to Iran’s leaders warning of the limits of a nuclear deal with the Obama administration, unlike some of his Republican Senate colleagues.
“I really don’t,” Blunt told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” today when asked whether he had any second thoughts on the letter.
