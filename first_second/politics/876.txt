The killing of two New York City police officers this past weekend has created a backlash against critics of law enforcement, including President Barack Obama, and have made efforts to improve the nation's racial climate more difficult.
In the aftermath of the execution-style murders, some political figures are assailing Obama's recent criticism of law enforcement's treatment of African-Americans, especially the racial profiling of young black men. The critics say Obama has made it seem that he is deeply unhappy with police conduct, and some are even saying his comments about improper police practices have added to anti-police attitudes across the country.
