La libreta, the Cuba ration booklet, encapsulates the debate about Cuba's socialist experiment. Detractors say that the fact that food is still rationed after 50 years, and that over 60 percent of the island's food is still imported, proves the failure of a bureaucratic, state-run economy sapping the entrepreneurial spirit of workers and farmers. Supporters say the ration book exemplifies the Cuban government's commitment to the health and welfare of its people in the face of a relentless U.S. blockade. They say that thanks to Cuba's guaranteed food basket and free health care, the poor island nation has one of the lowest infant mortality rates and highest life expectancy rates in the world.
