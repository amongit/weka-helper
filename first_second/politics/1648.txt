Much has been made of Brian Williams's inaccurate statements regarding events that he experienced as a reporter in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, while covering Hurricane Katrina. There's no question that there are significant discrepancies between what Williams has said happened and what actually happened. In particular, it is now clear he was not riding in a helicopter that was damaged by ground fire and forced to land. Still unclear is whether Williams deliberately lied about these events or "misremembered" them.
In any event, NBC has decided that Williams's credibility has suffered sufficient damage that he needs to be removed from his post as lead anchor for six months. NBC executives explained their decision stating, "By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News."
