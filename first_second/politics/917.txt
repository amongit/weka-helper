President Barack Obama and key U.S. officials are ratcheting up their efforts to show how seriously they take the possibility of a deadly Ebola epidemic in the United States.
White House officials announced that Obama received an update from health and national security advisers Monday on the latest developments regarding the spread of Ebola in Texas. The president also spoke with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and with French President Francois Hollande about the need for other nations to work with the United States to stop Ebola in West Africa.
