Four years ago, when president Obama was elected, the feeling amongst his supporters was one of exhilaration and they were exuberant about the possibilities that lay ahead. This year, the prevailing feeling is one of relief. An election that has been fuelled by fear and cynicism means that Obama's supporters are not so much elated to have won but more relieved not to have lost. The turmoil and frustrations of his first term mean that his supporters also have had their expectations tempered for a second time around. They will need to be patient as given the state of Congress, it will be another two years before he can really start getting things done. However, a steadily improving economy should give him the chance to set his stamp on his second term.
What he faces internationally will be markedly different from the time when he took office. He will hope that winding down the two wars will decrease the tension in the Middle East but this is a very different region from 2008. On one hand, sanctions imposed against Iran have led to a diminishing of its threat and the country is further away from developing nuclear capability. On the other, the Arab Spring has radically changed both the personnel in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, and also the nature of the region. Those now in charge after the revolutions do not feel that they need to toe the American line or be dictated to by those in Washington. Hilary Clinton's replacement as secretary of state will have to be adept at balancing the different interests and personalities found in the region.
