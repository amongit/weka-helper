WASHINGTON -- The Iowa-based conservative nonprofit group American Future Fund released new advertisements nearly every week from the spring of 2012 through Election Day that year, hitting President Barack Obama or Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races. By mid-September, the group had spent $9.5 million. It went on to spend north of $30 million on federal races after receiving massive funding from the network operated by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
This year, with eight weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, American Future Fund advertising is nowhere to be seen on the air. The nonprofit, which does not disclose donors, has spent less than $250,000 in federal campaigns and has announced little in the way of issue advocacy targeting candidates.
