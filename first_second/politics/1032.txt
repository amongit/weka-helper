One of the entertaining, if very insider, side stories of the 2012 presidential elections was the politico-cultural civil war that went on in the world of punditry. On one side was the traditional pundit class, accustomed to using its prophetic special sauce – varying parts gut, experience, reporting and data – to inform news consumers of the state of play; on the other side were political science nerds – “quants” for their quantitative mindset – who lacked years of shoe-leather campaign-coverage experience, didn’t bother with their guts and insisted that data alone could give a more accurate view of the election.
The old school pundits swore that the election was on a knife’s edge (or, hilariously, that Romney was surging to victory – “ All the vibrations are right.” – polling data be damned). The quants said that Obama was strongly favored to win. He did, and so did they.
