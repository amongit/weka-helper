Secretary of State John Kerry pushed back Thursday against reports that Florida Gov. Rick Scott had barred state officials from talking about "climate change," saying that future generations would judge inaction on the issue as a "moral failure."
In a speech at the Atlantic Council, Kerry didn't specifically name Scott or Florida, but he made reference to reports that state officials had been told not to use terms such as "climate change" or "global warming" in official documents. He blasted those who were "not willing to face the facts," saying it was time for climate action, not discussion.
