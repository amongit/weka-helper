In 2008, like many young progressives, I supported President Obama with the fervor of the converted. He was so magnanimous in his support for all the right causes, so captivating with his prose, and so fresh in his perspective that I believed that his election would actually catalyze a new dawn in American politics, one of justified hope and substantiated change.
The jubilation of his 2008 election will forever live with me, like so many others in my generation. But for me, that memory will serve not as a reminder of the history we made that night -- but of the silly emotions of a na√Øve young man who didn't understand that hope and change required more than flowery prose and a winning smile.
