The joy and excitement of being part of the Religions for the Earth and World Council of Churches (WCC) and Religions for Peace's Interfaith Summit on Climate Change, the People's Climate March and other climate change meetings was amazing for me and beyond the expectations of many people who attended.
Many of the climate change events in New York City were mountaintop experiences. There were so many events and opportunities for listening to legends, leaders, and politicians concerned about saving the planet. Among the special speakers were Bill McKibben (co-founder of 350.org), Chris Hedges (American journalist), former Vice-President Al Gore, Jan Eliasson (Deputy Secretary-General at the UN), Iriama Margaret Lokawua (Indigenous Women Environmental Conservation Project), James Forbes (Senior Minister Emeritus of the Riverside Church), Vandana Shiva (board member of the International Forum on Globalization), Serene Jones (president of Union Theological Seminary), and Jim Wallis (founder and editor of Sojourners magazine). All these people were prophetic in their call to change our ways, live lovingly and think about saving the planet.
