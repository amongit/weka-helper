Washington (CNN)U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power on Monday sought to quash any doubts over the United States' continued commitment to a strong alliance with Israel, amid tensions over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress on Tuesday.
Power directly addressed the controversy swirling around Netanyahu's visit to Washington, downplaying talk of tensions between the U.S and Israel and insisting that the U.S.-Israel relationship "transcends politics." Her remarks came at the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual, high-profile conference, just moments before Netanyahu took over the podium.
