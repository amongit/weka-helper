Speaking in Barrington, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told a young girl that yes, her world is indeed on fire — but that other people were there to make it better.
“The Obama economy is a disaster. Obamacare is a train wreck, and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind — the whole world’s on fire,” Mr. Cruz said, according to video captured by Raw Story.
