We are hearing a lot about the need for a new "Pecora Commission," to conduct a comprehensive investigation of all the Wall Street abuses that led to the financial collapse and the general recession that has followed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for such a commission. A House floor vote on a bill sponsored by Rep. John Dingell is expected this week. The bill would establish an investigative panel with full subpoena powers. A companion bill, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, has bipartisan Senate sponsors, including Senators McCain and Grassley as well as several progressive Democrats. These efforts are an implicit rebuke to the Obama administration's economic team.
The original Pecora committee was not a commission, but the Senate Banking committee operating in investigative mode. Its chief counsel beginning in late 1932 was a former New York City prosecutor named Ferdinand Pecora. The committee began its work in March 1932, and Pecora became chief counsel later that year. It continued throughout 1933 into early 1934. The new Democratic chairman, Sen. Duncan Fletcher, who took office when the Democrats began the majority party after the 1932 election, kept Pecora in the job. Today, Fletcher is a footnote; Pecora is the name people remember. (As a former chief investigator of the Senate Banking Committee, I love to see Senate staffers make good.)
