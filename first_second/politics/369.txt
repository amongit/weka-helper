New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi has apologised to the party leadership and the workers for not delivering what they expected of her.
Speaking to mediapersons after it was obvious that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would register a record victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, Bedi said, "I apologise to the BJP party leadership and the workers for not delivering what they trusted me with. I want to aplogise to them as I could not live upto their expectations."
