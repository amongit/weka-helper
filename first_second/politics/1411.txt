Last week the New York Times released the results of a survey it conducted with about 1000 Americans. The headline read: "Many Feel American Dream Is Out of Reach, Poll Shows."
Despite the recent spate of good economic news, the Times explained, Americans feel generally discouraged about the state of the nation and their own future in it. The survey created a bit of a buzz and commentators rushed to offer explanations for the apparent contradiction of good numbers and bad vibrations.
