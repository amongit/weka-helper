It’s Tuesday, the 62nd day of 2015, the day everyone’s been waiting for, and not because Hillary Clinton might announce she’s running for some office somewhere in 2016. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steps to the podium in the House chamber. He’s come not to praise President Barack Obama, but to bury Obama’s anti-nuclear negotiations with Iran, in perhaps the most polarizing speech in Washington’s recent history. Obama, however, made a few moves too, increasing the pressure on a high-stakes speech. And given another bad news cycle (see below), Clinton’s probably happy to let Netanyahu grab the spotlight for a day or two. Here’s your Three-Minute Briefing, Bibi Edition, all the News You Can Use about Netanyahu (and other stuff) in 180 seconds or less.
A Little Chin Music: After House Republicans invited him to the metaphorical dinner, Bibi set the table on Monday with a toned-down but defiant speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Conference, criticizing the Obama administration for endangering Israel through peaceful negotiations instead of doing the talking with a few fighter jets over Tehran. While Netanyahu was warming up, though, Obama threw a couple high, hard fastballs at Bibi in an exclusive sit-down with Reuters news service. Obama criticized Netanyahu’s assertion that the White House is about to sell out Israel in Iran negotiations, and suggested Netanyahu - who complained about the side deals that got Tehran to the bargaining table - doesn’t know what he’s talking about: “[He’s] made all sorts of claims: ‘This was going to be a terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting 50 billion dollars worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the agreement.’ None of that has come true.” Watch the full interview here.
