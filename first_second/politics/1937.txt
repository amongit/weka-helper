LONDON (AP) - Church of England bishops appealed to Christians on Tuesday to take part in the politics ahead of upcoming elections, calling for a fresh moral vision for Britain at time of disillusionment.
The bishops said in a 52-page letter that it is the duty of every Christian to vote May 7. The letter, the first of its kind before a vote, touches on topics such as the concept of a living wage and Britain's relationship with the European Union.
