Welcome to Thursday, the 50th day of 2015, the first day of the Lunar New Year (it’s the Year of the Sheep) and the 73rd year since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, allowing the U.S. military to relocate and intern Japanese-Americans during World War II, in the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing. It took 36 more years before President Gerald Ford officially rescinded the order, calling its signing “a sad day” in American history and blaming it on xenophobia, prejudice and fear. Today, the day after a speech warning against blaming all Muslims for the actions of extremists, President Barack Obama hits Chicago and designates several national monuments, including a former internment camp in his native Hawaii.

Hope We Get Change: A new Quinnipiac poll shows voters in several presidential swing states are going thumbs-down on Obama’s plan to make community college free for everyone; on its face, not a big deal given it’s probably a non-starter with Congress. But consider: seven years ago, then-Sen. Barack Obama could do little wrong as swept through Iowa, Virginia and Colorado on his way to the presidency, the same states that are booing the college plan. Not a good sign for Hillary Clinton, who (if she runs) likely would have to find a way to refute the argument that she represents Obama’s third term.
