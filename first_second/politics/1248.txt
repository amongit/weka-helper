Just when you thought the bad romance between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Obama administration couldn’t get uglier, Secretary of State John Kerry upped the ante with a verbal smackdown of Netanyahu on Wednesday.
Kerry told the House that Netanyahu’s meddling in the sensitive negotiations with Iran makes it seem like he’s spoiling for a war he wants the U.S. to fight – the same position he took when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003.
