Marvin Kalb's new book, "The Road to War: Presidential Commitments Honored and Betrayed" (Brookings Institution Press), is an elegant synthesis of how easy, too easy, it has become for an American president, any American president, to go to war. Just ask George W. Bush. Not to mention how hard it is for one president to end a war – just ask the ghosts of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon about Vietnam.
Congress has ceded its rightful role in declaring war and tends to go along with the man in the White House. That we know. This book – which mixes reporting, reflections and scholarly analysis – draws a map for how we reached this point. It is superb in explaining the machinations of Nixon's Secretary of State, one Henry Kissinger, in China, Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
