Today, Conor Oberst and The Mystic Valley band release their documentary "One of a Kind," which chronicles their journey as they record and create two albums over the course of the past year. What makes this different than other music films is that it's available for free here in a project with Causecast, in hopes that's you'll donate a few bucks to a nonprofit of your choice. So yeah, it's tax day, and you're sending off your money to a government maybe you support, or maybe you don't - either way, what better day to actually help out a charity or cause you know moves you, where you control where the funds go? And, hey, catch up with a great band along the way...
