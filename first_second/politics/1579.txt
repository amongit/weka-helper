WASHINGTON -- The fate of what should have been noncontroversial legislation to crack down on human trafficking is uncertain after Democrats discovered that Republicans had slipped anti-abortion language into the bill.
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), creates a fund to help victims by using fees charged to traffickers. It easily passed the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support late last month.
