Barack Obama has called "growing inequality and lack of upward mobility... the defining challenge of our time." That was in Dec. 2013, before Thomas Piketty's book on this topic (Capital in the 21st Century) became a bestseller. Inequality is now a major concern of many people around the world. The World Values Survey reveals that the percentage of respondents considering that they endorse the statement "incomes should be made more equal" more than the statement "we need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort" rose from 37 percent to 48 percent in the USA between the 2005-2009 wave and the 2010-2014 wave of the survey, from 34 percent to 62 percent in China, from 36 percent to 59 percent in Sweden, and from 65 percent to 75 percent in Germany.
