WASHINGTON -- With their first act in full control of the new Congress, Republicans tried to push through a bill to delay the Volcker Rule, which limits risky trades by banks. The plan failed as Democrats rallied a majority of their caucus to oppose the measure.
Just weeks earlier, Republicans had placed a rider granting taxpayer support to other risky financial trades into a comprehensive budget bill. That measure passed, but not before bruising last-minute opposition from Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).
