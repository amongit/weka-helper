Hillary Clinton's loyalists want Americans to take away a particular perception from her ongoing battle over private emails: resilience.
Clinton allies and advisers say the furor shows that Clinton is and will remain a magnet for endless media scrutiny and the target of attacks by Republicans. "This whole thing is a lesson that there is an enormous amount of hyper-ventilation that goes on around Hillary Clinton," says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, a former adviser to Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. But those who know her say they have seen some positive signs in the way Clinton has handled the email eruption â€“ not taking criticism as personally as she used to, and demonstrating that she is tough and can bounce back from adversity, valuable qualities in a candidate and in a president.
