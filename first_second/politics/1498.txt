Soon the election will be over, and so will all of the obsessive fact checking.
Throughout the election both candidates have made gaffes and misstated facts and figures when talking about a variety of issues. In some cases, the statements have been retracted or edited, but both Obama and Romney have stood by false statements to this day. With the debates in the past, hopefully there will be making egregious errors -- but we're not holding our breath.
