Hillary Clinton has always played by the rules and worked hard for people, especially those who don't have a voice of their own. She grew up in a Republican home in Park Ridge, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Her mother taught her she should stand on her own two feet and as a woman she could accomplish anything she wanted. So she applied herself and graduated from Wellesley College with honors being chosen to speak for the students at her graduation in 1969. She spoke in response to a speech by Senator Edward Brooke (R-MA), the Wellesley graduation speaker, and talked about the right of people to stand up for what they believe and protest to change the world. That was the first time the press took notice of her.
From that day forward the media has had a fascination with her life and her work. Her every word has been dissected and often attacked. In a time of strong feminism in the '60s and '70s, it was often women who criticized her because she was willing to work for her husband's advancement over her own. I remember some women friends saying, "How can Hillary Rodham who has begun a promising career in Washington, DC be willing to move to Arkansas?"
