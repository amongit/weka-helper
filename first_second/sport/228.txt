LONDON (AP) -- The head of world cycling urged Lance Armstrong on Tuesday to abandon ''disrespectful'' plans to ride part of the Tour de France route a day before the professional peloton. The disgraced cyclist responded by insisting he was ''honored and humbled'' to be invited on the unofficial charity ride.
Armstrong, a testicular cancer survivor, was approached to join the ride by a former English soccer player, who is trying to raise $1.5 million for the fight against blood cancer.
