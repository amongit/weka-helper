It all began with roadkill. Banff, the crown jewel of the Canadian national parks, is a paradox. Big, primeval wildness and all it embodies -- peaks, waterfalls, and glaciers -- surround the townsite, the antithesis of wildness with its bustling boutiques and hotels. Highway 1, one of the busiest Canadian roadways, slices through the park via the Bow Valley. It vectors millions of people and their vehicles through this iconic landscape, creating a lethal corridor for wildlife. Indeed, in the 1970s animals died so frequently here that people called the highway the "meat maker."
To reduce roadkill, the federal government and Parks Canada created the Banff Wildlife Crossings Project. This ambitious project involved fencing the 50-mile corridor between Canmore and Lake Louise along Highway 1 and building many wildlife crossing structures. The fencing prevents wildlife mortality on the highway, and the crossing structures create a connected landscape for animals.
