In an effort to make the 2012 Olympic Games run smoothly, more than 10,000 volunteers donated their time to take part in London's massive Opening Ceremony. Now, thanks to a bit of creative thinking, one volunteer just may help ease your post-Olympics blues.
According to the video's description on YouTube, one volunteer created a time-lapse video to capture all of the atmosphere and excitement that enveloped Olympic Park throughout the Games' opening day. Incredibly, this was done, according to the description on YouTube, with only an iPhone and a specialized app.
