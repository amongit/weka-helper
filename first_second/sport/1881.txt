MANCHESTER, England -- Substitute Nicolas Lodeiro scored in the second half to give Uruguay a 2-1 victory over the United Arab Emirates in men's Olympic soccer Thursday.
Playing in front of a near capacity crowd at Old Trafford Stadium, the Emirates took the lead in the 23rd minute and looked like the better side for much of the first half of its Olympic soccer debut. Emirates captain Ismaeil Matar scored when he got around the goalkeeper after controlling a through ball.
