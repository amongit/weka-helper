That Johny Hendricks lost his welterweight championship to Robbie Lawler at UFC 181 in Las Vegas in December is no great shock. They'd had an extremely close fight the first time they'd met, nine months earlier at UFC 171, when Hendricks won a taut decision for the vacant belt, and Lawler is widely acknowledged as an elite opponent.
