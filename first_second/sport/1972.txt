The mood inside the Dog & Duck Pub here in Austin, Texas, is somber to say the least. The topic of conversation, even among the half-way followers, verges on the existential: Game 6 and the 20 seconds to an almost-championship, Game 7 and Timmy's bunny hop that almost went in to tie the game in the final seconds, Kawhi Leonard's missed free-throw that almost dropped and could have ended the series once and for all. Almost is the word that haunts today and more than likely, the entirety of next season for the Spurs and their fans. But almost is something to consider too, especially for a team many considered, as recent as this year, to be beyond their prime. Only five Game 7s have been forced in the last quarter century. Most of them have been grueling to watch, this one being no exception. But in this series there are some things we learned about the Spurs and a few things to look forward to. Here's the silver (and black) lining:
1. The Spurs Can Go the Distance While there were definitely signs of aging, particularly evident in the later games of this series with the Heat, there were also displays of incredible endurance from the likes of Tony Parker, who scored an average of 20.6 points per game while playing an average of 36.4 minutes on a tight hamstring (which doctors said could rip at any moment) and Tim Duncan whose performance was especially notable in these Finals, having scored an average of 18.1 points on 35.0 minutes. The Big Fundamental's reliance on, well, the fundamentals, have allowed him to age gracefully thus far. He's expressed no interest in premature retirement and Tony Parker has expressed no interest in leaving San Antonio. Couple the resilience of those core players in a physical series with the toughness of Boris Diaw and Kawhi Leonard, and the Spurs have a decent shot at another run in the not too distant future.
