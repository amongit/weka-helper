I know a youth league football coach who once duct-taped his 10-year-old son's wrists together for an entire practice to stop the aspiring quarterback from separating his palms when taking the snap from the center. I know another coach who admonished his crying, belly-aching 8-year-old boy by shouting, "Unless there's throw-up dripping from your face mask, get back in the huddle!"
And I can recall dozens of pee wee coaches and fathers downplaying a head injury sustained by a child on the football field by saying something akin to this age-old gem: "You'll be fine. You just got your bell rung."
