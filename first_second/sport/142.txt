STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Stanford ace Cal Quantrill, a top prospect for the 2016 baseball draft, needs Tommy John surgery and will miss the remainder of this season.
The son of former major league reliever Paul Quantrill was 2-0 with a 1.93 ERA in three starts. The sophomore right-hander threw seven innings in a 5-3 win at Rice on Feb. 27, but then missed his last start with what Cardinal coach Mark Marquess called ''soreness.''
