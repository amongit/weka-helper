-- Discus gold medalist Robert Harting of Germany put on two shows Tuesday night, one during his event and another after. His second was quite possibly the victory celebration of the London Games.
Harting ripped his shirt to shreds following his win - much like the Incredible Hulk - flexed his muscles and then took to the track to make a pass on the women's 100-meter hurdles.
