PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Yankees center fielder Jose Pirela sustained a concussion after crashing into the wall on Juan Lagares' inside-the-park home run, the first of three long balls off CC Sabathia, and the New York Mets beat their crosstown rivals 6-0 behind a dominant effort from Matt Harvey.
David Wright and Lucas Duda also connected off Sabathia, in his second start after having major knee surgery last year.
