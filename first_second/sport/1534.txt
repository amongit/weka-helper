Great Britain's WBA light-welterweight champion Amir Khan says he wants to move on to "bigger and better fights" following his fifth-round stoppage of IBF champion Zab Judah.
The 24-year-old is delighted with his all-round performance in Las Vegas, claiming his "speed and power" were too much for the US veteran.
