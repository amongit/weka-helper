Southern California's Narbonne High School girls' basketball team made the headlines last week, not for winning the state championship but for forfeiting a playoff game and being disqualified from further tournament play because they violated the conference uniform policy.
Showing solidarity with Women's Basketball Coaches Association "Play 4 Kay" cancer awareness program, the Narbonne Gauchos wore pink numerals and lettering on their white jerseys in a city playoff game. Professional and college teams were praised for doing the very same thing earlier in the month. Yet the conference rules state that teams must wear only their official school colors, green, gold and black, unless prior approval is received for alternative colors. Conference Commissioner John Aguire defended his ruling: "That's what the rule tells me. I am going to be consistent." Aguire explained that Narbonne was under probation for having played a disqualified player the previous year. "Administrators are responsible for making sure their teams and kids are doing the right things," Aguirre said.
