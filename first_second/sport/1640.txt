Lately the term "Christian minority" has been floating out of the mouths of politicians and political pundits alike. The term refers to Christians who oppose homosexuality and who are subsequently labeled as bigots because of it. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) at a Tea Party conference last year noted, "The greatest minority under assault today are Christians." Recently, CNN published an article, "When Christians Become the Hated Minority," where writer John Blake quotes the identification by Peter Spriggs, spokesman for The Family Research Council, of a new victim: Christians who believe the Bible condemns homosexuality but are afraid to voice this belief for fear of public backlash.
Is there any truth to the "Christian minority" label? I argue that it is a myth.
