The union representing NFL players, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), put out an alert yesterday letting players know they have a little more than 30 days left before they can be randomly tested for banned substances.
Marijuana can stay in someone's system for up to 30 days, so it's really aimed at players who use marijuana. If they stop using marijuana now they should be ok if they get tested (beginning on 4/20, coincidentally). While it's great to see the NFLPA looking out for the players, the NFL needs to do a better job looking out for player safety.
