PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Less than five years ago, Rick Tonge was riding a chairlift at Sugarloaf ski resort in Maine when five chairs - including his - plummeted 30 feet to the snowy ground below, injuring him and his son.
Then over the weekend, another chairlift at Sugarloaf malfunctioned by going backward, prompting some frightened skiers to bail out and raising questions about the safety of aging infrastructure at New England's ski resorts.
