Entering the NBA Finals, Oklahoma City was scoring at such an electric rate it seemed that its Game 1 effort of 105 points on 24 transition points seemed par for the course. Russell Westbrook flew through the lane with reckless abandon, Kevin Durant proved unstoppable and the Miami Heat appeared vulnerable. But then the adjustments happened, and now the Heat has won two straight while containing the vaunted OKC fast-break.
The Thunder is not a team that relies solely on its running game -- it ranked second in the league in half-court efficiency (per Synergy Sports) -- but its uptempo attack is a juggernaut that feeds the rest of its offense. Scoring a combined 23 transition points over the past two games, OKC has failed to eclipse the 100-point mark for the first time in back-to-back games since Games 2 and 3 of its conference semifinal series with the Lakers.
