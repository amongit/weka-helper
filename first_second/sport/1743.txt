After enduring John Idzik's reign of blunder and Rex Ryan's reign of bluster, New York Jets fans now stand assured that the reins of the franchise are finally in the hands of grownups. Through his brilliant offseason moves, general manager Mike Maccagnan has brought back excitement and hope to a long suffering fan base that was left despondent after a catastrophic season. Equally important, he is apparently working harmoniously with head coach Todd Bowles, who was characterized by Brandon Marshall as "a man's man" and a "leader" (they had worked together in Miami).
In effect, the New York Jets have gone from no secondary to speak of, to one that is potentially elite. The key move was the return of Darrelle Revis. It rectified a mistake of historic proportions that will demonstrate to eternity how clueless Idzik was and why he should be a perennial candidate for worse GM ever. Maccagnan managed to bring back the best cornerback in the league, address the most glaring weakness in the team's roster, weakened the arch divisional rivals New England Patriots and ensured that Rex and the Buffalo Bills stay away. He also gave the franchise a face, (crucial in NY and everywhere really) and allowed many fans to start rummaging their closets to retrieve their Revis jerseys. Add to all of the above that the deal is brilliantly structured: the 30-year-old Revis gets $16 million guaranteed the first year, $17 million the second and only $6 million guaranteed in the third. Translation: top dollars for a top player while he should still be near his prime.
