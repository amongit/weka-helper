(Reuters) - Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao have agreed to take part in a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) Olympic-style testing program ahead of their May 2 mega-bout in Las Vegas, USADA said on Friday.
Drug testing had long been a major stumbling block in bringing together the biggest drawcards of their generation, but USADA confirmed both fighters have consented to rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned-substance list.
