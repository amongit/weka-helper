MONTREAL (AP) -- Russia's Sergey Kovalev stopped Canada's Jean Pascal early in the eighth round Saturday night to retain his three world light heavyweight titles.
The large Bell Centre crowd booed when referee Luis Pabon stopped the fight, with the dazed Pascal (29-3-1) against the ropes from a series of blows from Kovalev (27-0-1).
