As the oldest (and only girl) in a household with four younger brothers, people automatically assume that I grew up with Sports Center just as much as I grew up with Disney. False. While I -- like every Atlanta resident -- can't help but love the Atlanta Braves, you would never find me glued to a TV or screaming until my throat hurts. That was until I met my unexpected love, college basketball.
I'll never forget my first basketball game at Indiana University. Crowds poured into Assembly Hall, decked out in cream and crimson and full of exhilarating energy and pride. Earlier that evening, I decided to go "all out," too, rocking my red and white shirt and my new IU face stickers. Little did I know that I would stand in the same stadium as a senior with candy striped overalls on, yelling until my voice was completely gone. The IU Kentucky game was one of the best nights of my life. Yes, non-sports loving me had one of the best nights of her life at a basketball game. We beat the Wildcats right as the buzzer went off, and the entire stadium stormed the court. The thought of that sight still makes chills run up and down my spine.
