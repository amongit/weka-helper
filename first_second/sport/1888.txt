Olympic gold medalist Camille Muffat was killed on Monday in a helicopter crash while filming a reality TV show in Argentina. She was 25.
The versatile French swimmer first hit the pool when she was just 7 years old. By the time she was 12, Muffat was training under Fabrice Pellerin, head coach of Olympic Nice Natation, a top training facility for champion swimmers.
