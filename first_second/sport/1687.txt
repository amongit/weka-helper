The way the body's natural circadian rhythms work could give West Coast NFL teams an advantage when they play night games against East Coast teams, a new study suggests.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School, Stanford University and the University of California, San Diego, analyzed 106 games played after 8 p.m. ET between West Coast and East Coast NFL teams from 1970 to 2011, and compared the outcomes of these games with 293 daytime games played by East and West Coast teams.
