LONDON (AP) -- Andy Murray is testing out retired Swedish tennis player Jonas Bjorkman, with a view to adding the doubles specialist to his coaching team.
The fourth-ranked Murray has been looking for a second coach to work alongside Amelie Mauresmo since splitting from long-time team member Dani Vallverdu in November.
