Amanda Bird's quest to adopt a stray dog who was among those rounded up during the Sochi Olympics continues to be a challenge.
Bird, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, drew worldwide attention during the Olympics by deciding to rescue and adopt a dog she named Sochi. Many people Bird had never met, even actress Katherine Heigl and her family's foundation for rescue animals, began providing assistance after hearing her story, which took another turn Saturday when the dog was diagnosed with distemper.
