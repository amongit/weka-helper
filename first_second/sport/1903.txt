I have just arrived at The NZ Festival of Tennis, and the atmosphere here, rather than the games, is what I would like to write about. Because by just discussing the games, you do not take into account the natural and cultural environment of the event. Or you only do so to an extent, because obviously if the court temperature is really hot, then some players can get affected by it worse than some others. But tennis events are obviously about more than just the players, they are also about the crowd, the organizers and the volunteers. So in this article I am going to have a look at these groups and how they are operating at this event.
Obviously there are two distinct types of crowd; on the one hand there is the general spectators, and on the other hand are the corporate bunch. I will start with the general spectators, who are right now it seems, baking in the heat of the stands, waving their fans or whatever they can in their face to cool down. The on-court temperature at the tennis in Auckland is reguarly around 30 degrees Celsius. And so it is always a must to have a lot of sunblock on hand, and a hat. It is also noticeable in the crowd that a lot of people have a cold drink on hand. This combination of sunblock, hats, and cold drinks is the ingredient that cuts to the core of New Zealand's annual tennis event. The tennis events Down-Under at the beginning of every year are all about the unbearable heat. This heat ingredient is much more prevalent in Australia than in neighboring New Zealand. But the heat in NZ is still a factor at the tennis. And for the crowd it is mostly a factor that adds to the events enjoyment. Spectating at the ASB Classic and Heineken Open is now seen as an important part of the Kiwi summer, and baking in the sun is all part of the fun of the event. On the most part the crowd laps it up, and loves it in the process.
