TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Talladega Superspeedway will add SAFER barriers in three places before NASCAR visits in May.
Talladega chairman Grant Lynch says the decision comes after an extensive safety review by track owner International Speedway Corp., NASCAR and ARCA. All tracks are being looked at in the wake of Kyle Busch's crash into a concrete wall last month at Daytona.
