VILLA CASTELLI, Argentina (Reuters) - French and Argentine investigators scoured the charred wreckage of two helicopters in a rugged region of western Argentina on Thursday for clues to what caused an in-flight collision that killed 10 people, including three French sports stars.
The head of Argentina's investigation team promised a meticulous investigation into Monday evening's accident, which killed Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat, yachtswoman Florence Arthaud and boxer Alexis Vastine.
