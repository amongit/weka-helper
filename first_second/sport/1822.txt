Amanda and Elaine Dai are sisters and competitive rhythmic gymnasts who train at Rhythmic Dreams in Newton, Massachusetts. "Rhythmic Diaries" is their account of balancing training and competing in this rigorous sport with being normal high school students. The cauldron ablaze and tensions high, the 2012 London Games are officially underway. Already they are marked by extraordinary triumph and poignant heartbreak (for instance, in the case of our women's artistic gymnastics team), yet they will also be riddled with controversy.
Many have pointed out there are two women-only Olympic sports: rhythmic gymnastics and synchronized swimming. An article titled "It's Time to Kick Out Some Olympic Sports" and the like have surfaced within recent years and target the two sports, galvanizing an incendiary response. Regarding rhythmic, critics are not as concerned about the lack of a male Olympic counterpart as they are about the outward image it projects: young women sporting crystal-covered leotards and colorful cosmetics.
