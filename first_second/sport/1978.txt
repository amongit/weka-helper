According to Tim Duncan, it was a bunny. By any name, the short right-handed hook shot is the type that the four-time NBA champion has made throughout his career. In the final minute of Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals, he missed it.
"Game 7, missing a layâ€‘up to tie the game," Duncan told reporters after the game when asked what will stick with him longest about the series. "Making a bad decision down the stretch. Just unable to stop Dwyane and LeBron. Probably for me Game 7 is always going to haunt me."
