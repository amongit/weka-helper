For the next few weeks, one thing in the world of sports is certain. Sportscasters will spend hours upon hours explaining why the Heat beat the Spurs in Thursday's' NBA Finals.
Sportscasters will haphazardly spit out theories about LeBron James' determination, Tim Duncan's emotionally cracking, or maybe even the "destiny" of the Miami Heat. Who knows, they might even credit rapper Pitbull's "Feel This Moment" Miami Heat remix as an inspiring source of the Heat win.
