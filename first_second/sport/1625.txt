Former New York Jets running back Curtis Martin didn't always wear the jersey number 28. But when he did adopt the number, he did so for religious reasons, according to a recent interview on NBCSN's Pro Football Talk.
The 41-year-old Hall of Famer told the interviewer that when the number became available he sought consultation from a pastor on whether to adopt it or not.
