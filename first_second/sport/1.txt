(CNN)World number one Novak Djokovic withstood a second set rally from Roger Federer to claim his fourth ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells Sunday.
Djokovic appeared to be cruising to victory when he led by a set and a break, but the Swiss maestro broke back to force a second set tiebreaker, which he won to force a decider.
