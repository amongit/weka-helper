Geno Auriemma and his UConn Huskies are ready to begin their quest for a third straight national championship.
The Huskies earned the first overall in the women's NCAA Tournament and placed in the Albany Region. They are looking for their 10th overall title, which would tie Auriemma with UCLA men's coach John Wooden for most all-time.
