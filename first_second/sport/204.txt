(Reuters) - The San Jose Earthquakes became the latest team in Major League Soccer to move into their own purpose-built venue and they celebrated the opening game at the Avaya stadium on Sunday with a 2-1 win over the Chicago Fire.
A capacity crowd of 18,000 only had to wait until the fifth minute for the opening goal to San Jose's rookie Fatai Alashe, who headed home from close range after Chicago failed to clear a corner.
