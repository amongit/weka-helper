LeBron James and the Miami Heat produced plenty of high-flying highlights en route to winning the 2012 NBA championship, but one of the best plays of the postseason may have come from a team that they eliminated way back in the first round.
A few games before the New York Knicks were sent packing by Miami in the first round, J.R. Smith threw down a wild, acrobatic double-pump slam in Game 3 that seemed like it shook Madison Square Garden. Down by 10 early in the fourth quarter, the Knicks guard drove to his right past LeBron, found some open space underneath the hoop before soaring across the lane for the emphatic dunk.
