College football season is almost over... hard to believe huh?! How'd your team do? The Wolverines had a pretty terrible year... but now we've got coach Harbaugh so GO BLUE! All you Buckeye fans, I'm sorry, I had to say it... For the past 8 years whenever I'm in Ohio I always hear, "You went to Michigan?! Ugh that's awful!" Or I'd be in Michigan and hear, "You're from Columbus Ohio?! I hate that place!" You see, I grew up in Buckeye land but became a Wolverine, which means I get crapped on from both sides. If I'm in Ohio everyone hates my Michigan gear, if I'm in Michigan I can never mention I'm from Ohio. Not the best! Why is any of this relevant? Well, it got me thinking about the word "competition" and how it plays out in our lives. Is it possible to be competitive and collaborative? Could Brutus ever snuggle up to a Wolverine? What if we could all compete as one? That would be pretty cool huh?! Yeah it would! And I'll show you how in this first episode of Kip TV (ahhh the first episode... sorry I got excited)! Check it out below, you'll never think about competition in the same way...
Competition has been woven into the fabric of our existence. Ed Macauley once said, "When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win." True! And so often we're taught that competiveness=strength. That we should only be looking out for own interests. That it's a win lose game and there's only one winner.
