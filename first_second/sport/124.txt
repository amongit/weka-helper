SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame didn't let the pressure get to it.
The top-seeded Fighting Irish were flustered briefly by DePaul's press and fell behind early, turning the ball over four times in five possessions. But once Notre Dame settled down and Michaela Mabrey started hitting 3-pointers, the Irish took control and beat No. 9 seed DePaul 79-67 on Sunday night in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
