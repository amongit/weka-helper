There are a few really great food feuds that will never die: New York pizza vs. Chicago pizza, whether it's a hoagie or a grinder, whose barbecue is the best and whether or not beans are allowed in chili. NOW EVERYONE CALM DOWN. Since football food season is now on, we want to tackle the age old question of which chili recipe is the best chili recipe.
The answer, really, is kind of a cop out so please don't yell at us -- all chili is good chili and we can live in peace and harmony when it comes to beans. Really, seriously, Texas. We see you getting red in the face over there. Your meat-and-chile-only chili (also known as a bowl of red) is one of your greatest contributions to American culinary history. But if someone wants to put beans in it, they should totally be allowed to. Because beans are delicious, cheap and good for you. For goodness' sake, Cincinnati puts cocoa powder in their chili and it still tastes good, so we've decided that chili really cannot be screwed up. In case it wasn't clear, we are giving beans in chili our blessing.
