MERIBEL, France (AP) -- Marcel Hirscher of Austria became the first skier to win the men's World Cup overall title for a fourth straight year on Saturday.
His only rival for the title, Kjetil Jansrud, trailed by 60 points but the Norwegian speed specialist decided not to start in Sunday's slalom, the final race of the season.
