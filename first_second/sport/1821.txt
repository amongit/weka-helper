LONDON (AP) - Aliya Mustafina couldn't take her eyes off the scoreboard, staring it with pride and delight.
She capped an impressive comeback from a serious knee injury with the gold on uneven bars Monday, while Beth Tweddle finally got an Olympic medal, winning the bronze. It was Russia's first gold in women's gymnastics, and gave Mustafina a complete set after her silver in the team competition and bronze in the all-around.
