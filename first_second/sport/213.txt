MERIBEL, France (AP) -- Anna Fenninger overcame her nerves and a strong challenge from Tina Maze to clinch her second straight World Cup title in style Sunday, joining Marcel Hirscher on the winners' podium as he celebrated a record fourth straight men's title.
Both won their races, with Hirscher winning the men's slalom to capture his third straight globe in that discipline, and Fenninger making it a great day for the Austrians as she held off Maze to win the women's giant slalom, also defending that title in the process.
