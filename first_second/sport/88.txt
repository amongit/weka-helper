UFC president Dana White had his opinion on which direction he'd like to see veteran heavyweight Alistair Overeem go toward after "The Reem" delivered a beatdown to fellow vet Roy Nelson on Saturday night.
It was suggested that Overeem, the former Strikeforce and Dream champion, should meet up with former UFC champion Junior dos Santos, a bout that was originally slated as a title fight in 2012 before it fell out.
