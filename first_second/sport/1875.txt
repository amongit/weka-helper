LONDON -- FIFA has imposed a two-match ban on Colombia player Lady Andrade after U.S. forward Abby Wambach said she was "sucker-punched" by her opponent in an Olympic soccer match.
FIFA says its disciplinary committee suspended Andrade for a group match against France on Tuesday, and for the quarterfinals if Colombia advances.
