Home runs are on the rise early on in the Southeastern Conference and Florida coach Kevin O'Sullivan believes that should lead to more exciting games around the league.
''It used to be a three-run deficit felt like a huge hole,'' O'Sullivan said. ''Now you feel like with a couple good swings, you can get back into the game. Every game, you better play all nine innings.''
