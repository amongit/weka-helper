I began looking into the ice-bucket challenge because I was thinking of launching a challenge of my own. It turns out that it originated as the Cold Water Challenge. It was to donate to cancer research or jump into cold water. In Indiana, money was raised for a child with an inoperable brain tumor. In Auckland, it was used to raise money for the Cancer Society of New Zealand. In New Jersey, a fire department posted a video on YouTube using fire hoses. (They were later sanctioned for using department equipment without permission.)
