When I was a kid, I was ice skating and remember going really fast. Next thing I recall I was being tended to in the changing room by my sister and employees of the skating center. Apparently I had been going so fast that I lost control, hit my head, and knocked myself unconscious. That incident rendered me fearful of the ice. Fast forward to 2012 when I was discussing this incident with 1994 Olympic speed skating Gold medalist Dan Jansen. He told me, "throw a helmet on and get back out on that ice." His advice was spot on. In the face of fear one must face it rather than avoid it. To ignore that which we're afraid of only gives the fear more power, while facing it will diminish it. This ice skating incident is perhaps a metaphor for other things in life.
What do you do when you feel like you have no control over a situation? Maybe you've had your own ice skating incident or perhaps you've been a passenger in a car with an inexperienced driver. If so, then you know just how out of control it feels when a driver doesn't brake quickly enough as a red light or an obstacle approaches.
