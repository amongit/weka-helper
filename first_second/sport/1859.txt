LONDON -- FIFA officials say Mexico forward Oribe Peralta's goal 29 seconds into the gold medal game against Brazil is the fastest score since the organization started keeping Olympic records in 1976.
Peralta got the Mexicans on the board on Saturday after a turnover by Rafael deep in Brazil territory. His right-footed kick hit the net just inside the left post for a 1-0 lead.
