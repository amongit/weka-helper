Men's Table Tennis: The men's singles gold medal match goes down at 10 a.m. and with top seed Jike Zhang and No. 2 Hao Wang in the finals, China will sweep men's and women's singles no matter what. If this match is anything like the women's singles match, we're in for a show. We may even see another yellow or red card. ONLINE
Men's Basketball: LeBron James and Kobe Bryant combined for only nine points against Tunisia. It could easily be a different story against Nigeria at 5 p.m. ET. After LeBron spent his day off watching the women's basketball team dominate and Kevin Durant rooted on U.S. beach volleyball, they may be relaxed and ready to put on another show. Or, the they might get even more time to relax on the bench while other stars like Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook entertain the crowd. It's really a win-win.
