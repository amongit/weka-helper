Ninety million people worldwide watched me step onto the tennis court to defeat Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of Sexes" 41 years ago. Looking back, my victory was more than a point of athletic pride -- it was about social change, part of a growing movement that showed women were equal to men.
Four decades later I'm proud of the progress that has been made -- not only in sports but in politics, in the workplace, in corporate board rooms, in pay equity and in our daily lives. However, so much more remains to be done. The match for equality that was started on that day in 1973 still in many ways continues today.
