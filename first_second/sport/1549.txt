Paula Radcliffe tells BBC Sport's Mike Costello she is planning to race in the marathon at London 2012 and is hoping to be in medal contention.
The marathon world record holder will be 38 when the Olympics begin in July, and tells Costello she feels an Olympic medal is "the thing that's missing" from her career, a feeling enhanced by media criticism of her performances at previous Games in Athens and Beijing.
