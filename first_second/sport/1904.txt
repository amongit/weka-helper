It has been over four decades since I anxiously turned the dial on my parents' black and white TV to watch the "Battle of the Sexes", the heavily-hyped, historic tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. But the female vs. male match between Grand Slam winner King and self-proclaimed male-chauvinist Riggs reflected more than what simply took place on the court. "I was playing for all women," King said at the time, "and I knew that it would have set (women) back 50 years if I didn't win." Fortunately, she did, thereby furthering the cause of women's struggle for equality in the 1970s. It had such a huge impact on society, in fact, that in 1990 King was named one of the 100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century by Life magazine.
