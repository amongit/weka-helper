I stopped following NFL football when Steve Young retired in 1999 after a string of debilitating concussions left him with "post-concussion syndrome," but I began to question my interest in the game long before that. Over the years, football appears to have evolved into blood sport, where part of the objective of the game is to see how many of your opponents you can get to leave the field on a stretcher. Ironically enough, some of the players are beginning to feel the same way.
Chris Borland's recent retirement after one spectacular season with the San Francisco 49ers has confirmed the obvious: NFL football has become too dangerous. The NFL tacitly agreed when they reached a $765 million settlement with 4,500 former players who claimed they should have been warned about the potential for crippling brain trauma. Even the new rule "barring players from forcibly initiating contact with the crown of their helmet outside the tackle box," (i.e. using the head as a battering ram) isn't enough to allay the fear of serious brain trauma among the players.
