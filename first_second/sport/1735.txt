In addition to walking away from what many expected would be a successful career in the NFL, Chris Borland said Sunday that he's giving back some of his money too.
"To play to one year is not a cash grab, as I've been accused of. I'm paying back three-fourths of my signing bonus, I'm only taking the money I've earned," Borland said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
