GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Alexander Edler's shot glanced off the post and bounced off goaltender Mike Smith's back and in with 3:13 left to snap a tie, and the Vancouver Canucks avoided a second tough loss to Arizona with a 3-1 victory Sunday.
A day after a stirring win in Los Angeles, the Canucks had hit the post four previous times while Smith stopped 41 shots in a remarkable performance a day after inadvertently banking a clearance pass off Brandon Sutter's backside and into his own net.
