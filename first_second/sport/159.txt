BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- IndyCar rookie Sage Karam's scheduled two days of testing at Barber Motorsports Park ended with an early accident.
Karam left with a sore right hand after hitting a wall Monday morning on Turn 14. He says he'll use it as a learning experience ''and make sure it doesn't happen again.''
