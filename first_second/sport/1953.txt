The Miami Heat finally assembled a legitimate half-court offensive scheme for 48 minutes, and the result was its most impressive total team effort of the NBA Finals. After escaping in Oklahoma City with an impressive 1-1 split, the Heat relied on a bevy of ball movement, floor spacing and unselfishness to capture Game 3 91-85 against a Thunder team that prides itself on all of the same.
Game 3 was a pivotal opportunity for the Heat to continue its momentum and not allow OKC to regain home-court advantage in the 2-3-2 format. After each superstar provided Miami with stellar Game 2 performances, LeBron James (29 points, 14 rebounds) and Dwyane Wade (25 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists) came out once again Sunday night in ultra attack mode, determined to make plays for themselves or for teammates.
