BERLIN, March 22 (Reuters) - Relegation-threatened Hamburg SV parted ways with coach Joe Zinnbauer on Sunday and have appointed sports director Peter Knaebel as his successor until the end of the season.
Zinnbauer, who took over from Mirko Slomka in September, was a surprise appointment but failed to drag them from the depths of the Bundesliga.
