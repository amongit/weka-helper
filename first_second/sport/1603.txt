Since retiring from the NBA, John Salley has only gotten betta. He's just launched target BettaLifechallenge, an inspiring, energizing jumpstart into the vegan world.
The goal is to "initiate you into this healthy way of life, to try it out for 22 days," he says, "to give people small, easily digested information to live a better life all the time." In addition to little bites, BettaLifechallenge offers bigger ones, with a 22-day detox meal delivery service through organic, plant-based DL revAMP and has plans to launch regional detox programs and retreats.
