While LeBron James' fourth-quarter disappearance in Game 1 of the NBA Finals was surely alarming for the Miami Heat, perhaps just as notable was Dwyane Wade's. Wade, of course, has long been one of the league's premier big-game players. Even when he struggled in the Eastern finals versus Boston, he seemed to come on in clutch moments, particularly when he closed out Game 7 with a barrage of buckets.
The great thing about Wade's game has always been his aggressive attack and the pressure it puts on opposing defenses. Not unlike Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook, Wade is most dangerous on the move. An explosive first step, along with a cadre of mid-range moves and fakes, forced Thunder head coach to use Thabo Sefolosha on him for most of Game 1; the strategy seemed to be that the Thunder would concede LeBron's inevitable 30 points, but that they would not be beaten by Wade. The question now is whether Wade's 7-19 Game 1 performance will prove to be a fluke or a trend.
