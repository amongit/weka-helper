FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The German bobsled federation has banned driver Manuel Machata from racing for one year for lending his bobsled to Russia's Vladimir Zubkov, who won two gold medals at the Sochi Olympics.
Machata did not qualify for the Olympics. He lent his private bobsled to Zubkov for a fee.
