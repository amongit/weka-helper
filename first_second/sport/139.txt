CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Drew Rasmussen tossed the first perfect game in Oregon State history, striking out 10 in a 3-0 victory over Washington State on Saturday.
It was the fourth perfect game in Pac-12 history, and first since Washington State's Joe McIntosh hurled one in 1973. The performance also marked the sixth no-hitter for Oregon State (17-5), and first since Jace Fry shut down Northern Illinois last season.
