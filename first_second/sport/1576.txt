The recent scandal involving Syracuse University's basketball team came as a personal disappointment to me since I've followed Syracuse varsity sports for almost 40 years in upstate New York. It is an area where Syracuse University sports are the high-profile collegiate event. I taught at SUNY, Cortland which has an outstanding Division Three sports program. But though a loyal follower of the Red Dragons of Cortland, I could also cheer for the Syracuse Orange on television and at "The Dome" and enjoyed watching them in the National Tournament almost every March.
I have highly regarded Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim from the time he first coached the team in the 1970's and became one of the winningest coaches in Division 1 basketball. I always admired him for his intelligence, resourcefulness and low-key style. With remarkable consistency he produced winning teams even at times when there were few outstanding players for him to work with. His teams won a national championship and came within a minute of winning a second.
