One lazy Sunday afternoon in March, more than a decade ago, light cascaded through our living room window and landed on a child-sized basketball hoop. It was illuminated in a way that held my attention -- like a scene from a suspense movie.
My family sat captivated by the fervor of lights and sounds emanating from the TV. An NBA announcer belted out, "Now introducing your Sacramento Kings!" The anticipation mounted as each of us waited to cheer our "favorite" player. Like most die-hard sports fans, we interact exuberantly with the television.
