Tennis is often overlooked as a good sport for children who may be busy with the more popular children's pastimes of soccer and softball. But, tennis has great benefits for children and can be a nice complement to sports children already play and love. With no team necessary, plentiful public tennis courts, and children's rackets and balls that can be purchased for a total of under $15.00, tennis is an affordable sport that can be played just about any time your child is ready.
