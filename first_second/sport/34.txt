OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The best part of Russell Westbrook's game on Sunday might have been his defense on Dwyane Wade. And that says a lot about his work on Wade.
Westbrook had 12 points, 10 rebounds and 17 assists for his second consecutive triple-double, leading the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 93-75 victory over the Miami Heat.
