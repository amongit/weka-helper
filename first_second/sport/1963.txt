In a new segment with Noah Coslov of CineSport, I break down why LeBron James was so dominant in Game 6 over Boston. Specifically, his ability to get to the elbow and operate within 16-feet and attack was a stark contrast from previous moments in this series where he started his move from 30-feet.
We also consider why James doesn't in fact viciously drive the paint more often because he can be so dominant. The Celtics failed to show up Thursday night and tried to defend James with a bundle of different looks; will LeBron come out in Game 7 with the same mindset? Or, will he fall to 0-3 all-time in Game 7s?
