Thank you to the lesbians who were our core strength and voices, who came to our sides and helped us do the dirty work while we were in shock. At that time morgues wouldn't even take away the bodies of loved ones and friends that passed over.
Me, I am sure I was exposed in the early '80s, and diagnosed in '88, six months prior to the Olympic Games.
