COVENTRY, England â€” Diana Matheson scored in injury time Thursday to give Canada the Olympic bronze medal in women's soccer with a 1-0 victory over France.
In the second minute of injury time, Matheson passed inside the penalty area to midfielder Sophie Schmidt, who turned, dribbled and took a shot. The ball deflected off defender Sonia Bompastor and landed at the feet of Matheson, who volleyed in the game-winner past goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi.
