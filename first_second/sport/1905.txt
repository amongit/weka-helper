All through his youth and early adulthood, David Wheaton built his identity in tennis, a savagely self-reliant sport. As a pro, Wheaton was a heavyweight contender, his career highlighted by a run to the Wimbledon semifinals, a ranking of number 12 in the world and victories over such Hall of Famers as Andre Agassi and Jimmy Connors.
It would have been easy for Wheaton to parlay the equity he accrued as a player and build a second career that continued in tennis. As a coach, as a broadcaster, as a guest legend instructor at corporate events; each of these paths was plausible.
