The world may never reach a consensus on who’s the better soccer player: Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. But for soccer legend Pelé, the answer is obvious.
"At the moment, people always try to compare Ronaldo with Messi [but] it's a different style," Pelé -- who, along with Diego Maradona, was named “Player of the Century” by FIFA in 2000 -- told BBC’s Sportsweek. “They are two great players, but in the past 10 years, the best in the world was Messi.”
