LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A top anti-doping official says Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao face far more severe penalties for a prefight positive test for a banned substance than a $5 million fine unsuccessfully pushed by a Pacquiao adviser.
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said a positive test would kill the May 2 fight, where the total purse likely will be more than $200 million. It also would subject the fighter who tested positive to a potentially career-ending ban of four years from competition.
