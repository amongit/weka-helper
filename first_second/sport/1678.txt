Scuba organizations say recreational divers shouldn't go below about 130 feet, but one Egyptian diver recently ventured a bit deeper -- going more than 1,000 feet below the ocean surface and setting a world record in the process.
The record-breaking dive took place last week, when Ahmed Gabr plunged about 1,090 feet into the Red Sea off the coast of Dahab, Egypt. According to Guinness World Records, that descent -- about as deep as New York City's Chrysler Building is tall -- is the deepest scuba dive ever.
