Move over, Ryan Lochte. You're no longer the cutest Ryan at the Olympics. The Internet's new pick? He's not an athlete, but he's supporting Team USA all the way. It's Ryan Wieber, gymnast Jordyn Wieber's big brother. We love that he roots for his little sis in a big way -- but his good looks, winning smile and talent on the football field don't hurt, either.
Ryan, who graduated from DeWitt High School in Michigan this past spring, filmed Jordyn around the house in the months leading up to the Olympics. The resulting video captures their adorable dynamic perfectly, brotherly teasing and all.
