When we compiled our favorite party dip recipes for football season recently, we thought we'd gotten everything we needed. Then, shortly after publishing, we realized we'd made a glaring omission. We had all the onion dips, loaded baked potato dips, gooey baked cheese dips and crazy layered dips we needed. What were we missing? Chili cheese dog dip.
Yes, you read that correctly. This is every ingredient in a perfect chili cheese dog made into a dip for chips. This stroke of genius comes to us from Host The Toast, and we will be forever grateful. See for yourself.
