The Detroit Lions have been eliminated from the NFL playoffs thanks to a controversial call by referees during a wild-card game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.
Detroit was leading 20-17 with 8:25 left in the fourth quarter when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a pass to tight end Brandon Pettigrew. The ball bounced off Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens' back, a flag was thrown and referee Pete Morelli initially announced a pass interference penalty.
