FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Brian Vickers will be sidelined for at least three months while the NASCAR driver is taking blood thinners to treat clots in his lungs.
Before Brett Moffitt drove his No. 55 Toyota in Sunday's race at Fontana, Vickers said he still hopes to resume his racing career after his latest medical setback.
