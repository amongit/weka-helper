BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A Bloomsburg University baseball player has been dismissed from the team for an offensive Twitter post about Little League World Series star Mo'ne Davis.
The user account belonging to Joey Casselberry had been deactivated as of Saturday night, but screen captures of the tweet show that the player used an offensive word while criticizing news that a Disney Channel movie was being made about Davis.
