SURPRISE, Ariz. (AP) -- Texas Rangers ace Yu Darvish says he's ''feeling great'' after season-ending surgery on his right elbow and looks forward to coming back stronger than before.
Darvish is back in Arizona with the team and spoke Sunday for the first time since the elbow ligament-replacement procedure five days earlier in Florida.
