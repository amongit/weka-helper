SAN BENEDETTO DEL TRONTO, Italy (AP) -- Nairo Quintana won the Tirreno-Adriatico on Tuesday despite finishing well off the pace in the seventh and final stage, an individual time trial.
Quintana, who was runner-up last year, finished 51st, 55 seconds behind stage winner Fabian Cancellara on the 10-kilometer (six-mile) course, but it was enough to take overall victory, 18 seconds ahead of Bauke Mollema.
