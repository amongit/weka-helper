The Tim Tebow drama begins again: Tebow has officially signed with the New England Patriots, his third NFL team in four years. And the real surprise is that he was reportedly signed to play not halfback, not tight end, not even a gunner on the punt team -- but quarterback.
Drama, after all, goes hand in hand with enigmatic 25 year old, and the media will blow the signing way out of proportion. Tom Brady is the starter, which means that unless some crazy, unforeseen thing happens, Tebow will never get on the field. Honestly, what other backup (most likely third-string) quarterback could generate any editorial buzz in June? June! Yet the strange and rare reality of Tebow -- whom the New York Jets quite literally could not give away -- is that the media love to cover him, to criticize him, but perhaps most importantly, to try to make sense of him.
