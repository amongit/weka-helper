When Lana Shields, 68, came across a local newspaper article highlighting her once-rival high school in 2011, she paid particularly close attention. As she read about the school's new rugby team and the giving coach that made it all happen, she knew she had to share that story with the world.
Shields teamed up with professional friends Nancy Fletcher, 57, and Cindy Ware, 55, and is now working to produce "Try," a feature film that tells the story of the inner-city students at Roosevelt High School in Fresno, California, whose lives were changed by an unlikely sport and the unconditional kindness, generosity and encouragement of their Irish-American coach, Herb Breen.
