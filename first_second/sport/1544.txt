Former sports minister Richard Caborn is delighted London have won the right to host the World Athletics Championships in 2017, describing it as a "fantastic benchmark" at which to develop a national legacy within the sport.
London, which failed with bids to host the 2001 and 2015 Worlds, will use the Olympic Stadium to host the event and Caborn believes this will help stabilise the future of athletics post-London 2012.
