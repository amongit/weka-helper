MANCHESTER, England -- In 1921, England's Football Association banned women from playing soccer on Football League grounds because the game was deemed "quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged."
The ban stood for 50 years. It was lifted the year of the first women's FA Cup final, when Southampton beat Stewarton and Thistle 4-1 in 1971.
