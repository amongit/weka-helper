As expected, the 2012 NBA Draft began with the New Orleans Hornets selecting Anthony Davis out of the University of Kentucky. The prized pivot returns to the city where the Wildcats cut down the nets at the conclusion of the 2012 NCAA Tournament.
Also as expected, the drama began shortly after Davis pulled that draft cap down over his famed unibrow. Despite rampant trade rumors before the draft began, the Charlotte Bobcats held on to the No. 2 pick, selecting Davis' former teammate Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.
