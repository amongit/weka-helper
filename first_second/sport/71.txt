NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- All the New York Islanders needed to get back on track was a playoff atmosphere and Jaroslav Halak back in goal.
Halak made 26 saves in his return to the lineup, and the Islanders snapped a season-high, four-game losing streak with a 3-0 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Saturday night.
