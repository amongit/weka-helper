By Matt Yoder, Awful Announcing Andres Cantor is one of the world's most famous soccer announcers for his legendary GOOOOOOL calls. So you can bet the Telemundo play by play man was going to give it his all for Mexico's stunning upset of Brazil in the Olympic soccer gold medal match.
Mexico's 2-1 victory in the Olymipcs (although the tournament amounts to a U-23 competition) can't be downplayed as they are arriving as a force in world soccer at the top level. What better way to announce that arrival than this call of Oribe Peralta's 1st minute opener.
