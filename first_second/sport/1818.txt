Aly Raisman understands. Better than most, the U.S. gymnast should comprehend how Catalina Ponor feels after losing out on an Olympic medal in the women's balance beam final due to a tiebreak rule. Earlier during the London Olympics, Raisman lost out on a bronze medal in the individual all-around final in similar fashion.
In the balance beam final, the 18-year-old Raisman was on the right side of the rulebook and won the individual medal that had eluded her thus far in London. Adding further drama to the event's conclusion, Raisman needed her score raised after an official inquiry just to bring the tiebreak rule into play.
