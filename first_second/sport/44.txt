SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- In a surprise move, Colorado released right-hander Jhoulys Chacin after the former Rockies' ace struggled this spring.
After going 1-7 with a 5.40 ERA last year, Chacin had a 6.52 ERA in four appearances in Cactus League games, two starts. He walked four and struck out five in 9 2-3 innings.
