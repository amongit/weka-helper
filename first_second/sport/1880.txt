By Charlie Scott, Goal.com Japan ran out shock a 1-0 winner over 10-man Spain in the Olympic Group D fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow, courtesy of a goal in the 34th minute from Yuki Otsu following some questionable defending from Martin Montoya.
Kensuke Nagai and Hiroshi Kiyotake could have made it a more comfortable win for Takashi Sekizuka's side as both wasted good chances either side of halftime, but Spain struggled to trouble Shuichi Gonda in the Japan goal, particularly after Inigo Martinez's sending-off at the end of the first half.
