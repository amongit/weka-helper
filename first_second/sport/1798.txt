If you have been paying any attention at all to the Olympics coverage, and even if you haven't been, there's a good chance you have at least heard Gabby's name. She's quickly become an American gem, a household name, and one who's name we will be hearing a lot more about. But why? With all those who are competing in London this year, what is it about Gabby that has made her rise to the surface and get noticed? A lot!
Gabrielle "Gabby" Douglas is only 16 years old, yet she's on a career path that most could only dream of. According to her bio, her first brush with gymnastics came at the age of three, when her older sister introduced her to cartwheels. It was apparently one of those things that just clicked for her, because that got her off to a rapid start that lead to where we are today. Her path to London has included officially starting gymnastics at age 6, leaving home at age 14 to live with a white host family in Iowa to train with her current coach.
