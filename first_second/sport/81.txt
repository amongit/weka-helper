(Reuters) - A frustrated Henrik Stenson fired a verbal broadside at rules officials and blamed them for his poor putting after he was put 'on the clock' on the way to a runner-up finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Sunday.
The Swede led eventual winner Matt Every with four holes left at Bay Hill, but three-putted the 15th and 16th holes after he and Morgan Hoffman, with whom he was paired with, were timed for failing to get through their holes quick enough.
