Ronnie 'the Rocket' O'Sullivan hits the 660th century break of his career in the fifth frame of his second round match with Judd Trump at this year's UK Snooker Championship in York.
However, the break was not enough to secure the 36-year-old a place in the next round as Trump went on to win the match 6-5.
