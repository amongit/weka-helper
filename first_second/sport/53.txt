LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An NFL team owner has designed a Los Angeles-area stadium for two clubs - with two home locker rooms, identical sets of office space and two owners' suites.
The Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1bluJSd ) says St. Louis Rams' owner Stan Kroenke doesn't need to partner with another NFL team to finance the $1.86-billion venue in Inglewood but that the league wants a stadium for two teams.
