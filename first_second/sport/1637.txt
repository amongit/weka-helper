When I was a little boy, I wanted to be a professional wrestler. It was the 1980s -- the height of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and pre-reality TV Hulk Hogan. True masculine theater of the absurd, complete with gargantuan men in tights who inspired the awe of children with physical mass and acrobatics.
That changed a few years later when I attended several wrestling matches in person, marking the beginning of the end of my affection for this kind of masculinity. With my evolving pre-adolescent mind, live attendance betrayed the illusions television could hide. From home, I had the benefit of cameramen angling to conceal faux jabs and slaps, and I was insulated from the kinds of people who go to wrestling matches alone -- drunk, smelly, Hulk-a-Mania T-Shirt-sporting 40-year-olds, offering beer to children and swearing that "This shit is real!" And television somehow protected me from the unsettling sense that wrestlers are more caricatures than men, often with features downright peculiar and grotesque.
