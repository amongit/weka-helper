Everybody has a Saturday ritual. Some people sleep off their hangovers from the night before. Others catch up with the morning paper over coffee. My Saturday ritual? Every Saturday I wake up early to surf with a group of kids locked up in a juvenile detention center in my hometown of Valparaiso, Chile. It's by far the best day of my week.
The first time I went surfing with the Valpo Surf Project I was 15 years old and scared out of my mind. It wasn't that the waves were big or dangerous, but the whole experience was totally foreign to me. Getting into my wetsuit for the first time made me feel like I was wearing a skin tight super hero costume without any of the super hero muscle to back it up. As a city kid splayed out on the beach, practicing popping up on a surfboard for the first time, I knew that I was out of my element.
