As a vast and geographically varied continent, Africa and its cultural practices have long provoked interest throughout the world. Africa is celebrated for its imagery of lush jungles, diverse tribes with unique customs, exotic wildlife, and archeological wonders such as the pyramids of Egypt, Timbuktu, and the Walls of Great Zimbabwe. Turbulence is also part of the mythology, with wars for independence through secessionist and separatist conflicts, famine and health crises. And then there are the visionaries who have fought for freedom, equality, and tradition, making a positive impact on history that will never be forgotten.
As individuals around the world have become increasingly familiar with the rich traditions of Africa, sports culture has also risen to play a pivotal part in the fascination of our continent. There is a saying that goes, "You'll know when an important soccer match is being played in Africa because the continent will literally come to a standstill." And it is true; everywhere you go, there are young boys kicking around a ball. As long as that ball can be kicked around, there will be a game.
