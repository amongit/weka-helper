SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Madison Bumgarner allowed only one hit, an Albert Pujols home run, over six innings, but the Los Angeles Angels rallied Sunday for a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
Matt Duffy and Justin Maxwell each had a homer against Angels' starter C.J. Wilson, who allowed three hits over 4 1/3 innings, walked four and struck out two.
