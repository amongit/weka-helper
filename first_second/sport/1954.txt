In a condensed NBA season, there has been no shortage of highlights, disappointments, and drama. The 2012 NBA playoffs began with the usual 16 teams from the West and the East and you might say that the Finals boast the two teams expected to be there. However, the Finals rest in the hands of two players not expected to raise the Finals MVP award when it all comes to an end: Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook and Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade.
OKC is loaded with young and explosive talent led by a fearless, yet reserved, Kevin Durant. There is no debate where eyes go and where the ball is headed when the Thunder need a bucket. Durant is the best scorer in the league and he makes it seem so effortless. He has a quiet game with a bit of flare when he dashes through the lane off one bounce and posterizes an unsuspecting victim in the paint. He has fluidity in his motions when he comes off a double screen, catches squared up, and rips the net. He has a calmness that never spikes above a five on the "cool meter" when his team is down. Durant is too hard to guard with his quickness, length, and knowledge of the game.
