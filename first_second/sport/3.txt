(CNN)Marcel Hirscher capped a historic weekend by snatching the men's slalom title with victory in the final race of the World Cup Finals in Meribel Sunday.
The Austrian was crowned overall World Cup champion overnight after his nearest rival Kjetil Jansrud opted not to compete in the slalom, but still had 55 points to make up on Felix Neureuther in the standings for that discipline.
