Long hours, the stress of work and very little time to decompress can result in health issues over time that is why exercise is paramount for most professionals. Trying to balance work, family responsibilities, socializing and exercise is not easy when you only have the weekend available to get everything done. The problem is weekends are usually the only time to recharge your batteries. The "weekend warrior" therefore tries to squeeze it all in and stay pain free while doing it. Whether you are a runner, hiker, tennis player, or gym rat the potential to injure yourself while trying to stay in shape is always looming. Injuries are the result of repetitive overuse over a prolonged period of time. The result of which can cause a breakdown of the soft tissue in your body such as in the muscles, tendons or fascia from head to toe.
One part of your body that takes a tremendous amount of beating during exercise are your feet. With a combined total of 52 bones, 66 joints and more than 200 tendons, muscles and ligaments in your feet, about 25 percent of the bones in your body are located from the ground up. So when your feet hit the ground everything changes and there are a lot of moving parts in play. The most common exercise related foot injuries that I see in my practice are plantar fasciitis, tendonitis and myositis. These are over use driven injuries because of improper lower extremity biomechanics or as we call it abnormal pronation forces in the joints of your foot. This type of joint dysfunction is due the joints in the middle part of your foot have a greater tendency to collapse resulting in the muscles, tendons and fascia to fatigue, get inflamed and ultimately prevent you from exercising.
