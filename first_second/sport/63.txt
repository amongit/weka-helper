TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay captain Steven Stamkos had a rare fight on the ice - and it hurt Boston's playoff hopes.
J.T. Brown and Anton Stralman scored 15 seconds apart soon after Stamkos got into a fight, and the Lightning stopped a 10-game losing streak against the Bruins with a 5-3 victory Sunday.
