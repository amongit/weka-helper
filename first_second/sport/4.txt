(CNN)Manchester City closed the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to three points with a 3-0 victory over West Bromich Albion which controversially had to play with ten-men for 88-minutes after another case of mistaken identity by EPL officials.
Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva were City's scorers but the match swung convincingly in the home side's favour when referee Neil Swarbrick sent off Gareth McAuley after just two minutes of play.
