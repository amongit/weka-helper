Five years ago, our lives were horrifically interrupted. I thought my son, Noah, had a stomach bug. He threw up and had a headache while getting ready for school. After hurrying to the pediatrician's office and insisting on an MRI, we went from "stomach bug" to "brain cancer" in less than seven hours.
After the longest night of our lives, Noah had surgery at 7 a.m. Nine hours later, as he lay in the pediatric ICU, covered in IVs, I sat by his bed holding his hand and told him, "Noah, I will get you through this. You will never remember it, but I will never forget. This will not define you."
