(CNN)A trademark finish from Luis Suarez gave Barcelona a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in El Clasico Sunday to extend its lead at the top of La Liga to four points.
Suarez latched on to a perfect through ball from Dani Alves to beat Iker Casillas with a low shot on 56 minutes and a revitalized Barcelona might have added to its tally as it took control in the Nou Camp.
