DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) â€” Joey Logano, the driver who seemed washed up at 22 years old, has won his first career Daytona 500.
Logano took the lead in the white-knuckle race following a restart with 19 laps remaining on Sunday. Once out front, his Ford was stout and he seemed to have the race in control until a caution with three to go at Daytona International Speedway stopped the race.
