I don't agree with Romney and Obama health care adviser Jonathan Gruber that Americans are stupid, but there is abundant evidence that we're incredibly gullible. And we're paying a big price for it.

We've been told over and over again by politicians and flacks -- including me in my previous career -- that we have the world's best health care system. As I explained in Deadly Spin, if you continue to believe that no other country could possibly have a better system than ours, it's because of the overwhelmingly successful PR campaign my former colleagues and I carried out over decades.
