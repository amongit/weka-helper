In the midst of every winter, I eagerly anticipate the excitement and hype that comes from two major sporting events. One, perhaps not surprisingly, is the Super Bowl -- in all its splendid, commercialized and global glory -- and the other, perhaps less celebrated by the general public, is the Australian Open Tennis Championship -- one of the four Grand Slams that takes place each year and it's in the middle of January.
In the past week, however, the excitement of the Super Bowl has been quickly "deflated" with talk of the Patriot's latest "cheating" scandal involving their handling of "deflated" footballs allegedly used to help them secure their victory over the Indianapolis Colts at the AFC Championship game.
