Great Britain's Phillips Idowu takes silver in the defence of his world triple jump title in Daegu, South Korea.
Idowu jumped a season's best of 17.77m, but it is not enough to secure gold as the USA's Christian Taylor achieves a massive life-time best of 17.96m to take the World Championship title.
