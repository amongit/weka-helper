Don't let the Miami Heat's four-game surge to close out the NBA Finals obscure the fact that they were pushed and tested from the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs until they lifted the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Well, the pushing and testing really stopped two quarters before NBA Commissioner David Stern awarded them the trophy. But you get the idea.
After handling the New York Knicks with relative ease in the first round of the playoffs, the Heat would trail in its series against the Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder. Along the way, the Heat relied on its unmatched athleticism to keep the title in sight and to produce some of the most thrilling highlights of the postseason.
