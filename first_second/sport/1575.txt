It's the Sweet 16 — the second week of the NCAA Tournament — and that means bragging rights for college basketball programs.
Check the cover of media guides or banners adorning arenas. They always start with Sweet 16 appearances. No bragging about the first weekend. Playing this week means you had two good wins and you are just two wins from the Final Four.
