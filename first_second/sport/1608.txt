By any approach, Week 11 in the 2014 College Football season appears to be one of the more impactful to the final rankings and playoff seeding. Based on our College Football Power Rankings, there are ten games involving two top 40 teams and four games involving two top 15 teams. That being said, while we started our analysis for Week 6 with a similar conversation, we expected chaos to reign at that time. Do not expect something similar this week. If anything, current favorites should strengthen their positions atop the college football landscape, further separating themselves from the rest of the FBS. One great example of this is projected to take place in East Lansing, Michigan, where Michigan State hosts Ohio State in what is almost assuredly a College Football Playoff and Big Ten Championship elimination game for the loser.
Michigan State is 7-1 straight-up and 4-3 against-the-spread versus the nation's 58th ranked schedule to-date. The Spartans have won six straight games, all by at least five points, since falling to the Oregon Ducks (our #5 team in the College Football Power Rankings) on the road in mid-September. Michigan State currently ranks seventh in our College Football Power Rankings. With stellar play from junior quarterback and NFL prospect Connor Cook as well as its typically dominant defense, Michigan State is the only FBS team that ranks in the top ten in offensive passing efficiency and defensive passing efficiency. Michigan State out-gains its opponents by more than three yards-per-pass and has a resounding national lead in sack margin, allowing a sack on eight percent fewer pass plays than its opponents (Michigan State #3 in sack rate allowed and #7 in defensive sack rate).
