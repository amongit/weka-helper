March is a busy time for high school juniors and their families. Here are our March college readiness tips.
Testing: Help students develop their spring 2015 testing schedules. This is the last year for the SAT as we know it, so juniors have two good choices between the SAT and ACT. Please have juniors take SAT subject tests this May or June for content classes they are taking now as knowledge slips away during the summer. Low-income students can take each SAT or ACT test twice with fee waivers. Also please have students store their passwords as they often forget them next year when they need to send scores out. Now is the perfect time to continue or start a test prep class. Princeton Review, http://www.princetonreview.com, offers good beginning classes. There are also free test prep programs online, such as https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat.
