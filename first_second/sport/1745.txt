The conclusion to be made after the flurry of moves Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles have made this week is that they're all, for the most part, unnecessarily stupid.

A team that wins 10 games in back-to-back years and was one Mark Sanchez mediocre performance short of a second straight NFC East title is a team in need of simple tinkering.
