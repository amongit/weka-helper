Two weeks ago, former NBA player Larry Sanders spoke out about his struggles with anxiety and depression and his exit from the league. While mental illness is quite common, it is rarely discussed. I hope Sanders' openness will make it easier for others -- particularly the young people he is a role model for -- to come forward and seek help when they need it.
We rarely speak about mental health, especially among children, even though millions of young adults experience the pain of a psychiatric disorder. This is changing, thanks to people like Sanders. And that's important, because of the costs of not talking. Ignored and untreated, early mental illness leaves children and adolescents at a higher risk for academic failure, school dropout, alcohol and substance abuse, entering the juvenile justice system and even suicide.
