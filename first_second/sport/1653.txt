As a kid, I spent a lot of time thinking about playing professional sports. I went to sleep thinking about it, I dreamt about it and I woke up thinking about it.
When I was outside playing ball, even by myself, I constantly imagined that I was hitting the game-winning shot. I even sat around daydreaming about it.
