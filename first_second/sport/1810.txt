This week on "Big Brother" (Sundays at 8:30 p.m. ET and Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS), two houseguests will meet five very fierce and special guests.
The 2012 Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team a.k.a. the Fierce Five -- McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, Gabrielle Douglas, Kyla Ross and Jordyn Wieber -- will surprise houseguest Shane, who wins the luxury prize, and Danielle, who he invites to join him. And as the photo here indicates, they'll do their best "not impressed" looks.
