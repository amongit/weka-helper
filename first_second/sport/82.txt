TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Marco Dawson won the Tucson Conquistadores Classic on Sunday for his first Champions Tour's title, breaking a tie with a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-4 16th hole and closing with two pars for a two-stroke victory.
The 51-year-old Dawson shot a 3-under 69 to finish at 13-under 203 in the first-year event at Tucson National, the longtime home of the PGA Tour's defunct Tucson Open. He opened with consecutive 67s to take a one-stroke lead into the final round.
