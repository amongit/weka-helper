SAN REMO, Italy (Reuters) - Germany's John Degenkolb celebrated the biggest triumph of his career after winning the Milan-San Remo one-day race, the first of the season's five "Monument" classics, on Sunday.
The Giant-Alpecin rider stayed safe in the peloton during the 293-km ride, the longest of the World Tour season, and then easily outsprinted defending champion Alexander Kristoff of Norway (Katusha) on the Via Roma.
