Tennis history was made today as Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova to win her 6th Australian Open. More importantly, Serena's 19th Grand Slam singles title surpasses my childhood tennis icons Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. This latest victory reminds me why Serena knows how to stand out and WIN - in tennis and in life.
Since bursting onto the tennis scene in the late 1990s, Serena (as well as older sister Venus) knows what it is like to not fit in. In the hallowed halls of professional tennis, it's rare to see top players who are black - not just from the United States, but from any country. Serena and Venus were outsiders who challenged the tennis establishment, and that's why I gravitated to them. As an immigrant, racial minority and gay man, I root for anyone who stands out as different and still succeeds.
