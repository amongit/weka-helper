Watch out ESPN.
Fox is set to unveil a national cable sports network during a press conference on Tuesday, according to Richard Sandomir and Amy Chozick of The New York Times. Dubbed Fox Sports 1, the network will reportedly begin broadcasting in August 2013 and feature MLB, college football, NASCAR, soccer and UFC. In January, Sports Business Journal reported that the Speed Channel would be rebranded as Fox Sports 1 and that the new flagship sports network would be joined by Fox Sports 2, itself rebranded from Fuel. Speed is already available in 81 million homes, according to SBJ, with Fuel checking in north of 37 million.
