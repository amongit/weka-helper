NEW YORK (AP) -- Nashville Predators forward Craig Smith has been fined $5,000 for high-sticking Buffalo Sabres forward Jerry D'Amigo.
The incident occurred in the first period of the Predators' 3-0 victory Saturday and resulted in a four-minute penalty. D'Amigo took a high stick to the face that drew blood. D'Amigo sat out the entire second period and wore a full cage when he returned in the third period.
