No runner -- not even the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt -- can beat a cheetah in a race. But this incredible new video from Earth Unplugged shows us that a greyhound, the world's fastest recorded canine, comes pretty close.
In the video, greyhounds Sooty and Sweep run alongside the “vampire bat mobile,” where a camera is recording in high definition. Head-on shots capture the dogs chasing a toy dragged behind the vehicle.
