LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Detroit sluggers Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez welcomed their first Grapefruit League at-bats of the season.
Cabrera, who had offseason surgery to remove a bone spur from his right ankle and repair a stress fracture in his right foot, went 1 for 3 with a single and two strikeouts in a split-squad tie game against the Nationals.
