The U.S. Women's Gymnastics Team is pretty flexible, as one viral video proved. But even when rendered in stiff LEGO form, the Fab Five still manages to dominate at the Olympics and earn Team USA a gold medal.
The Guardian recreated the highlights of last week's Olympic gymnastics team competition -- entirely in plastic.

But Team USA pulled ahead, clinching the gold medal with a score of 183.596 points; Team Russia lagged more than five points behind. Watch as the Americans win gold, LEGO-style!
