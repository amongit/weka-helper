NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tommy Smith is retiring as president and chief executive officer of the Tennessee Titans, saying that dividing his time between the NFL team his late father-in-law founded and the other business left by Bud Adams was not good for either company.
Smith said in a statement released Friday that he cannot serve two big roles as effectively as he had hoped. He cites family, personal health and trying to make good decisions for two companies as reasons for his decision.
