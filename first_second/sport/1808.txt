Dominique Moceanu wowed the world as a member of the "Magnificent Seven," the U.S. women's gymnastics team that took home a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics. Her talent earned her the admiration of the country, but Moceanu says the path to Olympic glory was littered with attacks on her own body image.
Moceanu talked with HuffPost Live's Dena Takruri about the intense pressure and humiliation she felt from her coach Bela Karolyi, who was extremely critical of her body and blamed Moceanu's mistakes on eating too much.
