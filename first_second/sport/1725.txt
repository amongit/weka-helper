At the beginning of its current season, the NBA announced that the league's 101 international players from 37 countries and territories on opening night rosters was a new record. This was 9 more international players than the previous year's record total of 92, and was the first time that the league had over 100 international players. This feat was further accentuated by the fact that the reigning NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs lead the league for the third consecutive season with nine international players.
The evidence is clear: the sport of basketball is quickly becoming more global and will soon decrease the seemingly large distance between itself and football (American dubbed "soccer") on the world's popularity scale.
