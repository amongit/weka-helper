World number one Luke Donald states "to create history is something that will always stay with me" as he concludes the season at the head of both the US and European money lists .
Donald credits his battle with Lee Westwood at the PGA championship that sent him to the top of the world rankings as giving him "a huge amount of confidence", though he admits he would swap his ranking for a maiden major championship success.
