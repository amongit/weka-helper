Former world heavyweight champion David Haye is keeping in shape and ready to come out of retirement to face WBC title holder Vitali Klitschko in 2012.
Haye, 31, who retired in October 2011, blamed a toe injury suffered in training for the points decision defeat by Wladimir Klitschko in their heavyweight unification clash.
