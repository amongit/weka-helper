LAS VEGAS -- Jerry Colangelo and Mike Krzyzewski arrived in Las Vegas with a group of 28 players ready to participate in a four-day camp that will mark the beginning of preparations for next summer's World Cup in Madrid.
LeBron James isn't on the list. Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant aren't here, either. Not one player with significant Olympic experience.
