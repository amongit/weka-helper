DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Safety Louis Delmas is back with the Miami Dolphins, which means he'll be reunited with former teammate Ndamukong Suh.
Delmas, who is recovering from a knee injury, signed a one-year deal Friday to stay with the Dolphins. Last week Miami signed All-Pro defensive tackle Suh to a $114 million, six-year contract.
