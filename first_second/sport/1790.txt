What appears to have been the last American Dream Team sure gave us a lot of entertainment. They appropriately destroyed Tunisia and Nigeria, and came up when it mattered against Spain, Argentina, and Lithuania. But now that it's all over it's time to wrap up and see what we learned.
1. LeBron is on the top of the world. By now he is unarguably the best player in the world, and the best player since the Jordan. I will still never love LeBron, but the things he can do on the court are just jaw-dropping. He scores at will, and is probably the second-best passer in the world (second to the Nash). He rebounds like a center and finally learned how to play in the post. It's actually frightening to think that he is only 27 and is only entering the prime of his career.
