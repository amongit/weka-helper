Alright football/food fans, the Super Bowl is hurtling toward us once again, and you may be wondering what to serve at or bring to your Super Bowl party of choice.

But it turns out there are a few things not to bring/serve.
To keep you from humiliating yourselves, you'll find our list of the worst Super Bowl foods imaginable below. What's the worst thing you've ever seen at a Super Bowl party? Let us know in the comments!
