It's Game Six of the 2013 World Series. St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Michael Wacha steps up to the mound, winds up and smoothly delivers a pitch on its way to meet the Boston Red Sox Shane Victorino's bat. The bat makes contact with a "whack," delivering a game-changing, three-run double to give Boston a lead they would never relinquish. Had more balls smacked into the catcher's mitt instead, the Cardinals could have held off the Red Sox from clinching the Series win. The answer to achieving the elusive, seamlessly delivered pitch could lie in a scientific equation, combining biomechanics and physics.
Convergent Science, a company based in Middleton, Wisc., analyzed the St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright's curveball. They examined one of the best pitchers in baseball to find that his 12-6 curveball spins at 93-94 mph about an axis perpendicular to the ground at 1800 revolutions per minute of top spin. The combination of these factors creates the 11.1-inch drop for Wainwright and his knee-buckling curveball.
