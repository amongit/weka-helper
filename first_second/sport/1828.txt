Gabby Douglas now has an individual all-around gold medal to go with the team gold she won with her U.S. teammates. Dubbed the "Flying Squirrel" for her impressive array of aerial skills, Douglas edged Russian gymnast Victoria Komova, who took silver. Bronze went to Aliya Mustafina of Russia by way of a tiebreaker after American Aly Raisman finished with an identical score of 59.566.
The 16-year-old Douglas scored 62.232 while Komova scored 61.973. The Russian star took the last turn on the floor and couldn't reach the score needed to overtake Douglas. Beaming after finishing a sterling turn on the floor, Douglas could only wait and watch. Komova needed a score of 15.36 or higher to pass Douglas for gold but only earned a 15.100 for a solid routine.
