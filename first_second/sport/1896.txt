I am writing this before the outcome of the Australian Open Final. But I will say now that no matter what happens in the final does not change the fact that Rafael Nadal is my hero and deserves the title of GOAT. In this article I will start with stating why he is my hero, why he should be all of ours, and why he is the greatest example in tennis today of prevailing against human suffering. My other big piece of this article will be about why he, more than anyone else deserves the title of GOAT.
Simply put, Nadal is my hero because he has overcome struggles. But much more than me, is that he has proved the naysayers wrong. While it's true that he always had the talent, he initially was confronted by the problem that he was for a long time, much younger than many of the other players in tournaments. When he was eight he won the under-12s Balearic Islands Championship. Prior to entering, there were many that doubted whether a boy so young could win such a prestigious age-grade tournament against boys of much older. After all, 3-4 years at that age often seems like an eternity. The biggest moments in Nadal's career when he has overcome the naysayers though, have been when he has been crippled by injury. Especially in 2005 when he injured his tarsal scaphoid bone in his foot. His doctor said that he wouldn't be able to play tennis again. His own father said that he may need to choose another sport. But overcome this injury Nadal did, with the help of some specially made shoe soles. In 2012 it was his knee that crippled him, an injury that may have been caused by the soles that have spared him from aggravating his tarsal scaphoid bone in his foot. People thought he was finished, and that finally this was the injury that would bring him down. But as we all saw in 2013, he swept the field in winning two Slams and taking home the U.S. Open title.
