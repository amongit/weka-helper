Here's an idea.
It follows the stunning recent report that 79 percent of people polled want the Redskins football team to keep its name. In the evolving American consciousness, where there's growing support for illegal immigrants who want U.S. citizenship and for gays who want wedlock, the same impulse apparently does not recognize that the word redskins is as reprehensible and offensive to (most) Native Americans as the "n" word is to African Americans.
