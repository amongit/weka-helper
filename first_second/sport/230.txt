(Reuters) - Colombian Nairo Quintana laid down an early marker for the Tour de France when he won the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in impressive fashion on Tuesday.
The Movistar rider prevailed in Sunday's epic mountain stage which ended at top of the Terminillo in a snow storm, ahead of Alberto Contador, Thibaut Pinot and Vincenzo Nibali.
