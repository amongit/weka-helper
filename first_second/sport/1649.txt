My name is Mary-Ellen Powers, and I would like to share with you my story of social acceptance and overcoming bullying.
Academically, I did well in school and was mainstreamed in a normal classroom setting with help of a teacher aide or Special Education teacher as needed. Although, I struggled with peer acceptance my entire life.
