When I ran marathons and regularly put in 70 miles a week, I used no drugs, hit no one, and suffered only occasional injuries - dogs off leash didn't like me. When I played high school and college baseball, there were occasional melees with opposing teams, but nothing more than a black eye, a broken toe from spike wounds, and coaches were irreproachable although drill-sergeant strict.
Today, every sport is troubled by violence on and off the field, sexual predators, illegal drug usage, and corrupt practices. In the United States alone, one need only mention names - Bonds, Sandusky, Armstrong, Rice - but the list is endless. By no means is this an American phenomenon. Cycling doping has a century old history including most nationalities, accelerating as detection has become better and drugs more devious. Soccer fans have rioted throughout the world, cricket franchises have become corrupt, and communist states constructed their athletes by artificial enhancement and sometimes gender falsification.
