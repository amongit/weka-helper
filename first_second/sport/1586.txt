Just when we thought we couldn't love Vogue anymore, they go and put Serena Williams on their cover for the second time.
The athlete is on the April issue, which was shot by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz. In the image, we see Williams in a navy blue Rag & Bone sheath dress, natural makeup and, of course, her gorgeous curly hair.
