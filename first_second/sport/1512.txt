World Champion Sebastian Vettel admits he found it difficult not to be able to seek the win at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but was forced to hold his car back because of a gearbox problem.
Vettel's Red Bull team-mate Mark Webber took the victory at Interlagos, but Vettel says he is happy picking up the trophy for second place.
