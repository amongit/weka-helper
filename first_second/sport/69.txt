OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- A victory over the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs might not seem that impressive these days, but for the Ottawa Senators it was satisfying.
Kyle Turris had the winning goal and the Senators extended their unbeaten streak to six games, beating the Leafs 5-3 on Saturday night. More importantly, Ottawa is just one point behind the Boston Bruins for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
