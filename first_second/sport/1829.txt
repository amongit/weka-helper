You've seen her on the covers of Time and Sports Illustrated magazines, and have certainly heard her name-checked in every countdown of the top athletes to watch. So It's no wonder that Gabby Douglas is all smiles -- she's become America's golden girl after taking the lead in the Olympic trials and defeating the reigning world and national champion Jordyn Wieber. Though Gabby has trained for this moment since childhood -- even moving away from her family so that she could work with beam gold medalist Shawn Johnson's coach -- much of her success has come in the past year. Gabby won the gold in her signature event, the uneven bars, at the 2012 U.S. Championships and the silver medal in the all-around (coming in just behind Wieber). At the Olympic Trials, she edged out Wieber by just 0.1 points. Though the two girls will certainly battle for the all-around gold, what's important to remember is that together, they'll lead the U.S. to a team victory. Read on to find out Gabby's favorite music and what she's looking forward to purchasing at Harrods.
