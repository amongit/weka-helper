What would my medical predecessors from the 19th century have thought about the cavalcade of athletes, especially the history-making members of the U.S. team, who so proudly marched into the Olympic stadium in London for the 2012 games?
When these modern games were revived in the 1890s, physicians then argued successfully that women should be limited -- encouraged to applaud male athletes but not to compete because the amount of energy they needed for reproduction left them little for physical, psychic or intellectual endeavors.
