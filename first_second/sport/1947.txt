LeBron James, at the highest level, with the world watching, on the brightest stage, reached the pinnacle of basketball. In one of the great individual performances in NBA Finals history, James answered even his biggest detractors with equal parts clutch and dominance. His Game 5 triple-double summed up his immense impact throughout the series. Oklahoma City head coach Scott Brooks tried Thabo Sefolosha, Kevin Durant and James Harden. When that didn't work, he went with the double-team, which of course, didn't work, either.
Perhaps no other team in professional sports has been more polarizing over the past two seasons than the Miami Heat -- and no other player more so than James. The planet's best player though, now has his first world championship. And he has it at 27 years old, one year younger than the incomparable Michael Jordan was when he captured his first ring with the Bulls in 1991.
