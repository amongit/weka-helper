In November 2006 the voters of Michigan passed a referendum to ban any consideration of race in the admissions processes of the state's public colleges and universities, the most prolific of those being the flagship University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The referendum, officially known as the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative or Proposal 2, passed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent. It became law on Dec. 22 of that year. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative was challenged and overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on July 1, 2011. Soon after, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that he would appeal the ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld its ruling, which prompted Schuette to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. The case was granted certiorari in March 2013, and the Court heard arguments for the case of Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action on Oct. 15 of that year. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled by a margin of six to two that Michigan's ban on affirmative action is in fact constitutional.
