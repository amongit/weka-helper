Officiating prompted conversation and consternation all season in the NFL, so why should the playoffs — particularly the pass interference call that was, then suddenly wasn't, in the Cowboys' wild-card win over the Lions — be any different?
There's actually something ironic about such a ruckus raised by what wound up being a no-call, given that the competition committee's extra emphasis on, and rewording of, rules governing defensive-backfield play led to an increase in flags.
