Physicists use complex mathematics to calculate a projectile's trajectory--lots of sines, cosines, and the like. But sometimes you just get lucky, as you can see in this fun new video showing the YouTube trick-shot artists known as the Legendary Shots, who reload their homemade wooden catapult to sink a few amazing baskets.
"We used physics to a degree, but it was mostly just trial and error," Carson Stalnaker, one of the guys responsible for the catapult and the video, told the Huffington Post. The guys "had all taken physics in high school," he said, adding that it helped to have several engineers on the team.
