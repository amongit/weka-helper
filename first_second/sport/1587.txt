WASHINGTON -- Weighing in on the growing debate over amateurism in college sports, President Barack Obama said on Friday that universities bear "more responsibilities than right now they're showing" toward their athletes and that the NCAA should require schools to guarantee athletic scholarships with no strings attached.
"[T]he students need to be taken better care of because they are generating a lot of revenue here," Obama told The Huffington Post in a sit-down interview. "An immediate step that the NCAA could take -- that some conferences have already taken -- is if you offer a scholarship to a kid coming into school, that scholarship sticks, no matter what."
