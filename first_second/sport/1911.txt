After losing a close match to 553rd-ranked Wang Chuhan at the Shanghai Masters, the 17th-ranked Fabio Fognini completely lost his composure. The Italian started his temper tantrum by lightly shoving Chuhan after shaking hands with the umpire. Then he tossed a water bottle in the direction of the pro-Chuhan and capped off his performance by giving the fans the finger.
Classy.
