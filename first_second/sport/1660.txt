Sign The Petition to #SaveSanMiguel
One problem I have with conventional surf activism is that people often wait to mobilize until there's an imminent threat to their spot. If people wait too long however, it is often the case that the opposition has garnered too much momentum to be stopped. Usually by this point, the other team has already won over the policy-makers, with either rhetoric or money, and surfers voices get drowned out like a buoy on a foggy morning. This has been especially apparent in developing countries like Mexico.
