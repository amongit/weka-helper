The History of Thanksgiving and of football both can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and so it may not be so strange that the two would become intertwined in modern America.
The first American Thanksgiving is generally believed to have been in Plymouth Colony in mid-October of 1621, when William Bradford and the Pilgrims gathered with local Indians to give thanks for survival and the first harvest. The first Thanksgiving proclaimed by a president was November 26, 1789 when President Washington called for a national day of Thanksgiving for the new form of government.
