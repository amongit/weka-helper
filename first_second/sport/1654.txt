I was born with cerebral palsy because I did not get oxygen for five minutes at birth. When I was just a few days old, the doctors told my parents that there was a very good chance that I would never sit up or swallow.
The doctors were wrong. I swallow lots of different foods REALLY well! As you can see, I can sit up. I can play sports and have even won GOLD MEDALS in Special Olympics swimming competition!
