Even without the eyewear that he wore during the London Olympics, Tony Parker's eyesight seems just fine based on this halfcourt make. On August 30th, Parker joined a few of his countrymen for the Boris Diaw Charity Game Day in France. Hosted by Association Babac'Ards -- a charity created by Boris Diaw to educate youth about environmental and civic issues -- the event included Parker, Diaw, Clippers forward Ronny Turiaf, as well as Nicolas Batum of the Portland Trail Blazers.
After the young boy paired with Parker came up short in his half-court attempt to win a brand-new watch, the Spurs' star took the ball. To win it, Parker would have to sink the same shot. Lucky for the boy, he did just that.
