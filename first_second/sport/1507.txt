Romain Grosjean says his signing to drive for Renault , who will become Lotus in 2012, alongside the returning 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen is "a dream come true".
The French-Swiss driver raced alongside Fernando Alonso for the team in second half of the 2009 season, and has spent this year as a reserve driver to Vitaly Petrov, Nick Heidfeld and Bruno Senna at the Enstone-basted outfit.
