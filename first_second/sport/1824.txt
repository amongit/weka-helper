The U.S. gymnastics teams are having an unbelievable run in London. The women won team gold, and Gabby Douglas picked up an all-around gold medal. The men qualified first for the team finals, and though they failed to capitalize on it, Dannell Leyva came back and won an all-around bronze for Team USA. The final medals for artistic gymnastics will be awarded in the individual event competitions. Men's floor exercise, men's pommel horse, and women's vault will be decided on August 5, men's rings, men's vault, and women's uneven bars on August 6, and men's parallel bars, men's horizontal bar, women's balance beam, and women's floor exercise on August 7. All of the U.S. gymnasts except John Orozco and Kyla Ross will compete in at least one event final. While some are easily expected to win, other members of the U.S. squad could fight their way onto the podium.
