INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) -- Serena Williams withdrew before her semifinal at the BNP Paribas Open on Friday night with a sprained right knee, 14 years after her sister Venus did the same thing and triggered an angry reaction from fans that drove Serena to boycott the tournament.
The world's top-ranked player was to play third-seeded Simona Halep in the second semifinal. Williams addressed the crowd on-court after Jelena Jankovic defeated Sabine Lisicki 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 to reach the final.
