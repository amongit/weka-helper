This strong-willed tennis player was severely injured in the Boston Marathon bombings. More than a year after the attacks, she's back to show the world that nothing can stand in the way of her passion.
Kaitlynn Cates, former champion tennis player for Suffolk University, was injured by the first blast at the marathon, according to WCVB TV. Cates said she had lost nearly 30 percent of her leg, CBS Boston reported. After enduring several surgeries, a calf replacement and rehabilitation, Cates returned to the court last week as an instructor, giving her first clinic at Willowbend Country Club in Mashpee, Massachusetts.
