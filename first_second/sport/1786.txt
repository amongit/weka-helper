In 1976, Gail Marquis was playing on the first U.S. women's basketball team to compete in the Olympics. Around that time Audrey Smaltz was knee-deep in the fashion industry. Fast forward to 2011, when the basketball star and fashion commentator wed in New York City's Central Park.
Today, Marquis and Smaltz work together with Freedom To Marry to help legalize same-sex marriage across the United States. Take a look at the video above of the happy couple sharing their incredible love story.
