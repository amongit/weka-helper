Oddly popular for such an uncomfortable practice, the ice bath is hotly (sorry) debated in the fitness world. A new study adds fuel to the fire with the finding that a chilly dip after a tough workout won't do anything to ease soreness or reduce the loss of strength that's typical post-workout.
In the study, researchers had 20 active men run for 40 minutes downhill on a treadmill to induce muscle damage. After, half sat for 20 minutes in an ice bath at 5 degrees celsius (that's around 40 degrees Fahrenheit!) while the other half stayed warm and dry.
