In the latest health issue for surprise 2009 U.S. Open quarterfinalist Melanie Oudin, the tennis pro says her heart problems have returned, pushing back the start to her season.
Oudin, who upset Maria Sharapova during her upset-filled run at Flushing Meadows at age 17, wrote Thursday on Twitter that she ''will probably have to undergo another procedure'' for a heart condition.
