Senior football star Bryce Kemp might have made the best move of his high school career by purposely avoiding the end zone.
The athlete at Collins-Maxwell/Baxter High School in Iowa sprinted into the clear but mysteriously slid at the one-yard line on a punt return in the final regular season game last Friday. But his intent soon became clear, Iowa station KCCI reported: He wanted his childhood friend, offensive lineman Clayton Weltha, to have one last shot at scoring his first touchdown.
