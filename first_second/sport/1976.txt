In his postgame remarks, a triumphant LeBron James said he "can't worry about what everybody say about me." That may be a healthy outlook as it pertains to his critics but James still might want to take a few minutes and listen what this group assembled by Nike has to say.
Shortly after James and his Miami Heat clinched their second straight NBA title, Nike debuted a new ad celebrating the two-time champion. The commercial featured a static shot of LeBron's answering machine as it plays messages from several celebrities. Spike Lee, Dr. Dre, Coach K and Bill Russell are just a few who leave a congratulatory message.
