Chicago-based Fruition Partners has acquired Partners in IT in the United Kingdom, in a move that brings together two high-level ServiceNow cloud integrators and extends Fruition's footprint globally.
Together, the two solution providers employ approximately 300 service experts who have skills in the ServiceNow approach to IT service management (ITSM). The combined company plans to retain its existing offices and teams, with Partners in IT founder and managing director Paul Cash reporting to Fruition CEO Marc Talluto.
