No matter what we do for a living, most of us have busy days and the ease of technology has not served to be as helpful as we may have hoped. Rather than make the machinations of life easier, all these wonderful time savers makes us more aware of the fleetingness of time. What was once something we could "play with" is now something that stresses people out.
Consider the home front: the lunches for the kids, the house duties, the meals, the job, the relationships, all have times allotted to them. And if you work from home, it's not as easy as one might think and it doesn't necessarily afford us more time, just more time for distraction and interruption.
