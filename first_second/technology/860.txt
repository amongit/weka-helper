Microsoft got its big break in computing in 1980 when Jack Sams and his team from IBM visited the tiny Seattle company to sign deals for Microsoft Basic and CP/M for their forthcoming IBM Personal Computer, which was about to redefine the industry. Long story short: Microsoft sent them to see CP/M's owner, Digital Research, but when they were unable to agree a deal for its $495 operating system, Bill Gates supplied them with a $40 alternative.
At the time, Microsoft had annual revenues of $7.5 million (not billion) and a staff of 40 that included a new hire from Procter & Gamble by the name of Steve Ballmer. By contrast, IBM had a turnover of $26.2 billion and a staff of 341,279 - it was about the same size as General Electric and Gulf Oil, but made more profits than both of them put together.
