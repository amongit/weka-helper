To a lot of Indians, a missed call means a lot more than just a call that went unnoticed or that deserves a call back.
As opposed to pagers, right from the time mobile technology penetrated the Indian market and the usage of prepaid mobile users became big and the concept of missed call became popular amongst many Indians. Considering one won't be charged for a call that went unanswered, to many this concept became part of daily usage especially to prepaid users who didn't want their minutes deducted.
