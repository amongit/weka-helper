In the heritage of the Mac Pro, MacBook Pro and even a myriad of iPads in multiple form factors, the iPad Pro has been anticipated for some time now.

But some key industries will miss out. Here's why. If you were looking for news about the rumored tablet amid the Apple Watch extravaganza today, you can stop now. That's because it was left out -- if such a device even exists.
