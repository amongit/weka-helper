In recent decades, the IT sector has been Romania's wonder-child, maintaining steady growth supported largely by outsourcing companies. Located at the Eastern border of the European Union, only one hour ahead of Berlin and three hours' flight from London, the country became a flourishing technology hub. Both companies and developers are capitalising on several government initiatives, and know how to work the system to best effect.
Romania doesn't offer lowest prices in the outsourcing business, but it is highly competitive when you take into account the level of technical proficiency and soft skills in the country, "superior to what is typically found in other outsourcing locations," according to IDC.
