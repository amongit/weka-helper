Middle America, 2016 â€” For two years, Terence Rollins has sat in anger that his right, as an American internet customer, to unlimited data was tragically snatched away from him by his cable company.
Each month, Terence struggles on a paltry 500GB allocation rationed to him by the corporate overlords at Comcast. This ration breaks down to a mere 16GB of download quota per day, which depending on the encoding and compression used, is a tad over a depressing 3 hours of HD video from Netflix daily.
