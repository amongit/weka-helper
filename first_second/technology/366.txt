Growing up in the heyday of 8-bit computing, it wasn't difficult for me to start coding - and to start building my own early Internet of Things (IoT). With a box of bits from a surplus electronics store, several metres of ribbon cable, some Meccano, and a BBC Model B, I had a robot crawling around a school electronics lab, following lines and hiding in the darkest corners. So how do we give students today the same experiences, as computers become sealed appliances?
It's a question a lot of people have been asking, and one that's being answered by a raft of small single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. They're cheap and ubiquitous, and much more than purely educational devices which would only be for teaching programming or playing Minecraft. Like many of their 8-bit predecessors, they're also tools that will help build the IoT.
