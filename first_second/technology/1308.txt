At work I've often been jokingly called "the Mac guy", as in the past I was the one of the few with a Mac on their desk. Whilst Mac support at my current employer (SAP) is superb, in the past most places haven't supported my platform of choice. For pretty much all of the 2000s I've been on Mac, from the aluminium clad PowerBook G4 to my trusty (late 2010) MacBook Air I current drive.
So every time I changed companies, or IT changed major systems that I needed to connect to, I was spending lots of time and effort working out how to get my MacBook talking to the network. OS X has certainly helped, as Apple has supported more and more corporate features, but most of the time has been cobbling together a working solution based on copied configuration and the odd bit of third-party software to convince the network services to work with my Mac.
