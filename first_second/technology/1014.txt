Using an iPad as a second monitor for Macs is nothing new. Air Display from Avatron has been around for years, but using Wi-Fi to connect Mac and iPad wasn't the best as it resulted in laggy performance.
The release of the similar app Duet Display dealt with video performance issues over Wi-Fi by using a wired USB connection. It solved choppy video streaming and impressed me in my review of the app.
