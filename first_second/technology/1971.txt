By 2020 it's estimated that there will be one million open jobs for software developers in the U.S. alone. This number factors in the rapid growth of the IT field outside of pure software companies as data plays an increasingly critical role in traditional industries, and also as baby boomers holding IT jobs are set to retire in droves.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median annual salary for a software developer in 2012 was $93,350 so projecting forward, by 2020 that's approximately $100 billion in payroll nationally projected to go unfilled. We have a crisis in the making because these jobs traditionally generate greater disposable income, have a powerful multiplier effect in terms of new jobs that get created, and when filled, offer significant tax revenue opportunities to local, regional and federal government. It's a big problem, and while government and industry wring their hands about what to do about the shortage, and higher education moves at the pace of well, higher education in search of a solution, a new class of educator has emerged to solve the problem.
