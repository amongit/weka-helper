When Australia's favourite Attorney-General Senator George Brandis QC took office, he said that national security would be his focus. True to his word -- at least in this matter -- his three "tranches" of national security legislation have culminated in one of the most comprehensive proposals for mass surveillance of ordinary citizens ever seen.
Mandatory data retention is the way that Western nations are going , Brandis said, committing a logical fallacy. Even if "Western nations" are indeed going that way, that's not in itself a rational justification for us following them. But the statement wasn't even true -- and it's becoming less true as time goes on.
