Huawei and ZTE could face having to pay extra to import their products into the European Union, after regulators said they had gathered solid evidence that China had been subsidising them.
Representatives from the EU's 27 member states were told by officials on Thursday in a closed-door meeting that the European Commission had amassed "very solid evidence" of illegal state subsidies of the companies, the The Financial Times reported on Friday.
