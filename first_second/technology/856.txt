Tech companies often have different fiscal years and announce their quarterly result on different days, so it's hard to make comparisons, even if you have a superhuman memory.
However, a simple bar chart makes the obvious point: the old order has changed. IBM no longer dwarfs every other IT company. That function has been taken over by Apple. Its profits (below) give Apple an even more dramatic lead: it made more in its last quarter than IBM makes in a year. Its most notable challenger is Samsung, but that's a conglomerate, and it's hard to figure out how comparable Samsung Electronics really is.
