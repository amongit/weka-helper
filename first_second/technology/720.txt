The decision to build the National Broadband Network (NBN) as an infrastructure monopoly may have been controversial, but the original plan to build it using future-proof fibre left few options for opportunistic carriers to compromise its business case through competition. Now that NBN Co has well and truly shifted towards a multi-technology mix (MTM), however, such protections are off — as evidenced by the Australian government's uncomfortable stoush with upstart infrastructure provider TPG Telecom.
Now, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull is moving to introduce new telecommunications licence requirements that will pre-empt the drawn-out process through which the ACCC will declare in-building broadband services. This move is designed specifically to nullify any advantage to TPG by forcing it to wholesale whatever last-mile services it builds — but a look at the longer game suggests that if this is how the broadband game is now to be played, TPG would be smart to move quickly to buy up SingTel Optus' long-neglected hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) broadband network.
