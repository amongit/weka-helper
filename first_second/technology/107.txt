So Google has spiked its plan for a data center in Hong Kong , citing the reason that it's hard to acquire a large plot of land here in Hong Kong.
While there's now an official statement from them, there was already speculation in the local media a couple months back, when it was pointed out that the 2.7 hectare plot of land they had acquired for the data center in 2011 was still sitting idle, obviously not adhering to the initial plan of having the data center ready this year.
