Looking to turn an existing parking lot into a dedicated 12-storey datacenter, Clise Properties and the Graphite Design Group are waiting for a response from the Seattle design review board to start on their proposed facility.
With eight floors of data halls, the plan includes proposals to use the waste heat generated by the IT load as the heating source for this building, along with other adjacent properties being developed. The heat would be used as forced air heating in the datacenter tower and other local buildings. Clise has experience in this; it was the developer of the property that houses Amazon's datacenter in Seattle's Westin Building, which uses the waste heat it generates to provide heat to a four-block complex.
