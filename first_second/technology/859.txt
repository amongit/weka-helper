It's no secret that IBM has performed pretty badly over the past decade, and its 2014 turnover of $92.79 billion is only slightly ahead of what it was 15 years ago: $87.55bn in fiscal year 1999. As I wrote here on Wednesday, its latest quarterly revenues were smaller than Microsoft's, which means IBM's managers have been outperformed by Steve Ballmer.
It's also no secret that IBM has been undertaking a lot of financial engineering, with the aim of driving up its stock price. Rather than grow the business, it aimed to raise earnings per share to $20 by the end of 2015, a pledge that Rometty abandoned when releasing IBM's third-quarter results in October last year.
