Nobody can predict the future. We don’t know which way the economy will turn, and we can only guess how consumer behavior and preferences will evolve, and who knows what technology breakthroughs are just over the horizon. Analysts and pundits, whose work it is to prognosticate, can never seem to agree on the answers.
The good news is that when it comes to making technology decisions that you need to live with for years to come, I recommend an approach that does not require predicting the future. It’s simply a way to future proof your strategy. One way to do so is to build enough flexibility into your systems that you are able to respond to any of the possible outcomes.
