This month, two major studies on quantum teleportation have made it through peer review and been published, breaking previous distance records. Chinese scientists report teleporting photons over 97km and now a team working in the Canaries report doing the same thing, but between the islands â€” a distance of over 140km. Both experiments were completed earlier this year and have now been published in Nature.
The researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the University of Vienna, say their work paves the way for global quantum communications.
