Orange has confirmed that it has made an offer to buy Spanish fixed line telecoms provider Jazztel in a deal worth up to €3.4bn (£2.7bn; $4.4bn), subject to regulatory approval and at least 50.01 percent of Jazztel's shareholders giving the deal the go-ahead.
Orange's offer of €13 per share represents a 34 percent premium on Jazztel's average closing price over the last 30 days, Orange said in a statement.
