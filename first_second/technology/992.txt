BlackBerry is partnering with Indian handset makers Micromax, Spice, and Zen, in order to have their devices pre-installed with the BBM messaging app, according to a report by The Times of India. With the BBM messaging app pre-installed, users can directly communicate and message other BBM users without having to download and install the BBM app or incur download charges. The BBM messaging app is already pre-installed on Micromax's Canvas Turbo and will be pre-installed on forthcoming Canvas releases.
While it's great that BlackBerry has made the BBM messaging app available on other platforms, and is now engaged in having it pre-installed on handsets from other manufacturers, the obvious question is why did it wait so long; why didn't it do this sooner? To begin with, in my opinion, BlackBerry was late in offering the BBM messaging app available for the both the Android and iOS platform. I think it has lost a lot of market share within messaging to other apps, namely WhatsApp and WeChat.
