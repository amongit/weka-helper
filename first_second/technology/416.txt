It's like that final shoot-out in For a Few Dollars More. You've seen it: as Morricone's music builds, the three protagonists arrange themselves slowly in a circle, not taking their eyes off each other. The components of that scene come together after a long build-up: and so it is with datacentre converged systems.
We don't yet know who's going to win this shoot-out but we do know that the daddy of systems vendors, IBM, has finally joined the circle, which so far has consisted mainly of Cisco and HP, with Oracle standing by as a bit of an understudy.
