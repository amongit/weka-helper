Hungary is planning to tax internet traffic from the beginning of 2015, according to a bill submitted to parliament on Tuesday.
The draft bill stipulates that ISPs will pay 150 forints (â‚¬0.49) for every gigabyte of data traffic over their network. Hungarian authorities have said that they will make sure that the new tax will be paid by ISPs only, rather than internet users themselves.
