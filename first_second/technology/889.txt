Nvidia made its name selling GPUs to PC makers for desktops and laptops. But as Intel and AMD integrated more features into the processor and steadily improved onboard graphics, that business started to shrink. The company endured years of questions about "attach rates," industry jargon for the percentage of PCs with discrete graphics. Then the PC market collapsed altogether as users shifted their attention to smartphones and tablets.
In spite of all this, Nvidia just reported record revenues in the fourth quarter and for 2014. So far the company seems to be navigating the rapid shifts in technology, caused by trends such as mobile and the cloud. Gaming remains a key market, but Nvidia is increasingly finding new and interesting uses for its graphics technology.
