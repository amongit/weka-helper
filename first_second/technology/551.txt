In my last blog post I touched on the need to create energy-efficient data centres to ensure cloud computing lives up to its true potential. This time around I’d like to focus on a specific method for improving efficiency through high temperature ambient (HTA) data centres.
However, before I get rolling, I’d like to put the need for greater efficiency in context. First up, data centres are estimated to consume 1.5 percent of total world power and that consumption continues to increase. In concrete terms, that’s the equivalent of 50 power stations each year. They also generate 210 million metric tons of CO2, roughly the same as 41 million cars.
