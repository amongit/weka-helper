A few weeks ago, the "Nokia" name was expunged from product history, replaced by "Microsoft Lumia" and introduced to the world via the "535", the company's first solo outing in the phone landscape under Brand Microsoft Mobile Oy. The company had previously announced that it would gradually phase out all feature phones as well as the hybrid Asha series, which meant also ending support for those lines.
It is somewhat ironic that the first place where this transformation towards a new entity is happening is in a country that made Nokia one of the truly great brands in the world -- India.
