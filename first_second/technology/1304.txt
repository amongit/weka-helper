Google has published links to its Android 5.1 update factory images for three Nexus devices, with more on the way.
Google announced the release of Android 5.1 yesterday, meaning Android owners should see it pushed out in an over-the-air (OTA) update in the coming days, weeks or months, depending on which device they have. But Nexus owners who want to skip the wait can download the factory images directly from Google.
