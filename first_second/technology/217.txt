Belgian consumer organisation Test-Aankoop has successfully forced Apple to comply with Belgian legislation on product warranties.
The organisation sued Apple in 2012, claiming that Cupertino was violating Belgian law with its warranty policy. "Every company must respect the rights of consumers, even a giant like Apple. However, there was something seriously wrong with the information issued by Apple and its distributors, in particular regarding its policy on warranties stipulated by law and manufacturers own warranties," Test-Aankoop says on its website.
