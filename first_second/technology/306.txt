For European startups with an eye on expansion, the appeal of an overseas move can be hard to resist.
There are many different reasons why Estonian startups focusing on global markets might decide to move their holding company or business units abroad. It's important to be close to the clients, partners and investors there, for example, and it's easier too to find and attract investors, network successfully, and get experience of global business in countries like the US or UK.
