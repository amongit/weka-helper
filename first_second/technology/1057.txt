The signs for Samsung Electronics' mobile division are not good: Five quarters of profit decline coupled with a two-thirds fall in its yearly profit and decreasing market share finally took its toll last week as the company enacted a salary freeze; not exactly the move of a company on the rise.
The Korean giant is feeling the heat on two fronts -- from above, with the highly successful iPhone 6 family and the arrival of the Apple Watch, and from below, with pressure with most major Android handset manufacturers upping their shipments over the past year. In this atmosphere of intense competition, it is an extraordinary situation where the biggest player in terms of mobile handsets shipped is requiring its employees to forgo a bump in pay, and making its executives return a quarter of their bonuses, all while the company is yet to record a loss.
