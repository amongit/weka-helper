Last year, Red Hat decided that the 64-bit ARM architecture was ready for the data center and cloud. This year, Red Hat announced that its Red Hat ARM Partner Early Access Program has expanded to include more than 35 companies. It also expects them to contribute open-source system-specific software and drivers to the upstream Linux ARM community.
Red Hat's ARM partners now include silicon vendors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to independent software vendors (ISVs). Many of these companies are already Linaro members. Linaro is the non-profit engineering organization devoted to developing open source ARM architecture software. The goal of both is to make ARM servers ready for the most demanding enterprise server workloads.
