Africa's mobile operators, accustomed to fierce competition and a rapidly changing industry, are used to looking over their shoulders. But it isn't often that their biggest threat comes not from another telecom company but from a bank.
Kenya's dominant operator, Safaricom, found itself facing down Equity Bank earlier this year as the two battled it out in through the regulators over Equity's new 'thin SIM', a chip embedded into a thin plastic sheet that sits on top of an ordinary SIM card, making two services available simultaneously. Safaricom claimed the new technology, produced by Taiwanese firm Taisys, was unsafe, and could lead to fraud for the 15 million Kenyans using M-Pesa, the company's massively successful mobile money system.
