With Oracle choosing APIs as a legal battleground on which to tangle with Google's Android, I'm reminded of another time when APIs were used in lieu of competitive products in an attempt to control a marketplace.
In another life, I was a software developer. It was a long time ago, back when MS-DOS was alive and well and Windows was still just another DOS app, and when Microsoft was much more of a bogeyman than it is today. In the mid-80s, it seemed as if nothing would shift the Redmond giant: it was a commonplace that there was little point in launching new software, because if you were successful Microsoft would find a way to steal your market - and if you weren't successful, why bother?
