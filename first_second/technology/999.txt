According to my colleague Matt Miller's report, the new Chromebook Pixel is a nice refresh over the original model, albeit long overdue. The new fifth generation Core i5 (i7 available) processor should make it a screamer. I can't wait to get my hands on one.
While the new Pixel is a premium laptop, Chrome OS runs so well on low-end hardware that the Pixel is, in some ways, overkill. My old Acer C720 Chromebook had budget hardware when released, and still runs Chrome OS well.
