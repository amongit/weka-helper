Every year there are a number of high-profile IT events which capture the imagination. I tend to think that along with CES and Cebit, the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) is one of them. Clearly, it’s not as mainstream as others but you sometimes get a very good view of emerging dynamics that could change the industry for years to come.
In this respect, IDF 2011 didn’t disappoint. One of the things I found most interesting was the announcement that the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Data Center Alliance (ODCA) are set to collaborate to accelerate the development of cloud standards. Just to recap briefly, the ODCA is today comprised of over 300 companies who have come together to provide a unified customer vision for long-term data centre requirements. They aim to define usage models, influence industry collaboration and help create common standards for cloud technologies.
