Perhaps a microservice architecture is what service oriented architecture was always meant to be. SOA's value proposition was about the ability to break applications down into lightweight, discrete services that are well-governed and available for reuse.
The service-oriented process always tended to be unwieldy, with questionable or hard-to-measure business benefits. Microservices, because they are more lightweight, promise far greater flexibility -- which translates to more flexibility for business users to make changes. Potentially, then, microservices represent the next stage in IT agility, building on what already has built in terms of service oriented architecture, REST services, web APIs, and cloud services. Or is it just a new buzzword?
