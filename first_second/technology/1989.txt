Mario Andretti once said, "If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough."
It's one of my favorite quotes, and its business applications run the gamut. Put differently, safe is the new risky. Companies that cling to legacy business models, technologies, and mind-sets have always run the risk of becoming obsolete. (Polaroid, Kodak, and BlockBuster are but three cases in point.) This has always been true. Today, however, the twin threats of disruption and irrelevance are stronger and faster than ever. The Innovator's Dilemma is alive and well.
