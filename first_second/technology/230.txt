Eight major mobile operators in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) have announced plans to work together on a new network infrastructure sharing initiative.
The move — which follows a meeting between the operators at last month's Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona — is believed to be the first of its kind in any region, and is underpinned by a memorandum of understanding between mobile operators trade association the GSMA and the eight carriers themselves: Bharti Airtel, Etisalat, MTN, Ooredoo, Orange, STC, Vodafone, and Zain.
