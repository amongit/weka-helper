In Poland, regulations around government tenders have been notorious for putting an emphasis on price at the expense of quality. An update to Polish law earlier this year was supposed to put a stop to that, but ended up adding new complications to the tendering process that could make IT procurement even more painful in future.
Local Polish elections last month were mired in delays and irregularities around announcing the results. Politicians standing in one town suddenly 'won' in a neighbouring district, for example, and it took more than a week for the country's electoral commission to confirm all the official results. The cause was a new - and faulty - IT system that had been intended to speed up the vote-counting process.
