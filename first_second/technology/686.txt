Announced in June, a new HP technology path for the datacenter that is based on a new kind of computer memory called "memristors", was the subject of an analysis by the MIT Technology Review that appeared this week. The key seems to be whether or not HP can successfully manufacture the memristor-based memory in quantity, and in a timely fashion.
Working on getting the memristors produced since 2010, HP had originally announced there would be product available by 2013, but has now announced that the first working chips won't be sent to HP partners until 2016. The HP prototype system, called "The Machine", which will run an advanced version of Linux called Linux++, uses memristors as the only type of memory in the system, replacing both RAM and DRAM, as well as potentially replacing hard drives as they are used today.
