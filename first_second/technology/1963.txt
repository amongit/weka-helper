Who knows you better than anyone? Facebook, of course. In a recent study of 86,000 Facebook users, researchers compared the results of a personality survey completed by study participants’ family and friends to a computer analysis of the participants’ Facebook likes. The computer blew family and friends out of the water.
After 10 likes, the computer could better predict personality than a coworker; after 70 likes, the computer outperformed a friend or a roommate; after 150 likes, the computer was more accurate than a family member; and after 300 likes, even a spouse couldn’t beat Facebook.
