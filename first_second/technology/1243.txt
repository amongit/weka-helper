Last week, Facebook announced the addition private messaging functionality for its Instagram app. A direct shot at Snapchat after the company rejected Facebook's reported US$3 billion dollar offer a few weeks ago. The first thought that popped into my head upon hearing the news was...why is WhatsApp still around?
WhatsApp was one of the first messaging apps for the iPhone. The company has built up a large amount of users, but feature-wise it has been overshadowed by numerous other apps including LINE, Facebook Messenger, and Skype.
