The Middle East's startup landscape has changed significantly in recent years. Initiatives such as Abu Dhabi's twofour54 and Flat6Labs in Cairo have provided the means for entrepreneurs to develop their skills and businesses, alongside increasing investment opportunities from global funders like 500 Startups and regionally focused efforts such as the Amman-based Oasis500.
But despite this progress, a number of infrastructure, financial, and people-orientated challenges remain. Two separate reports published in the last month -- one by Wamda Research Lab and the other by Dubai Silicon Oasis -- highlighted some of these issues, and the need to address them if the full potential of tech entrepreneurs in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is to be realised.
