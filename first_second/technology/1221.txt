The impact of cloud on the whole IT outsourcing landscape cannot be over-emphasized. The question is: what kind of impact are we talking about?
On one hand, the wide availability of relatively cheap IT resources available via cloud and open APIs means everyone, to some degree, is now outsourcing some of their IT infrastructure. Even the mom-and-pop store at the corner may now be outsourcing IT. On the other hand, it also means that companies sign multi-million-dollar contracts with outside providers may be finding it easier, cheaper, and more within their control to simply cherry-pick the services they need or want from the cloud.
