It's easy to get used to how we use technology and think we've done things that way for a long time.
But one of my most visible technology opinions this year - my dependence on OneDrive placeholders - must be a recent development, since they only arrived in July 2013 as part of the Windows 8.1 preview. And sure, 18 months is certainly long enough for something to become indispensable, but what about 12 months? Am I still relying on technology I've known and loved for years or have new things in 2014 really made an impact for me?
