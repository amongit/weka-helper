A leaked draft submission from the content industry makes it clear that the Australian government's other controversial proposal — mandatory data retention — will be a useful tool in cracking down on online copyright infringement.
The discussion paper released by Attorney-General George Brandis and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull last month called for views on the best way to deter Australians infringing copyright online through downloading TV shows, films, and music. Some of the proposals put forward by the government favour blocking websites such as the Pirate Bay, and compelling ISPs to send notices out to customers who are infringing, with the ultimate result being deterrence or some form of punishment, be it through a throttled internet connection or rights holders taking alleged infringers to court.
