BlackBerry's multi-platform BBM app is turning out to be quite the hit for the company, this week passing 100 million installations on Google Play. While BlackBerry hasn't revealed installations on iOS and Windows Phone, it says the new Android milestone is "just a fraction of the total".
Whatever the overall figure, Android installations have grown significantly in the course of last year - BlackBerry said it had 60 million across all platforms at the end of 2013. Back then, installs via Google Play fell into the 10 to 50 million tranche, while in December of that year BlackBerry signed a deal with LG to pre-install BBM on its devices.
