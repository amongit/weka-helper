Motorola's second-generation Moto G, announced and on sale today, succeeds last year's Moto G , an affordable stock-Android handset that quickly became "the best-selling phone in Motorola's history", according to corporate VP EMEA and APAC Magnus Ahlqvist at yesterday's London press preview. The original £135 (unlocked) 4.5-inch Moto G was upgraded in May 2014 with 4G (LTE) connectivity and MicroSD storage expansion, this 'first-generation-plus' model costing £149.
Motorola has now equipped the Moto G with a bigger screen, stereo speakers, faster wi-fi and better cameras, plus dual SIM slots — all for a similar £144.99 price (for the 8GB model). Motorola's aim, as last year, is to offer "a premium smartphone experience at one-third of the price", as Ahlqvist put it. We've had a review unit for 24 hours, and here are our initial impressions.
