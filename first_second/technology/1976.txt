An astronomer is sometimes pictured as a person standing on the top of a hill, gazing into a telescope aimed at the night sky. That rather romantic scene is now gradually being replaced by images of people sitting inside offices, working on computers.
The information revolution did not skip astronomy, and most astronomical data now come in digital format. In fact, the virtualization of astronomical observatories, such the Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO), made astronomical data available to everyone, allowing any person with a computer and an Internet connection to do the same research done at the most prestigious academic institutes. Access to special labs or costly research equipment is no longer a barrier.
