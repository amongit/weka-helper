A lot of attention has been given to increasing the number of women in computer science, but despite numerous efforts the presence of female students in computer science programs is still far below the 50 percent equilibrium.
In the department where I teach just about 10 percent of the students are women, and things aren't much better at most other institutes of higher education. In fact, women representation in computer science programs is significantly worse than it was in the 1980's, when about one third of the students were women.
