Cyanogen has teamed up with app developer Boxer to create an email app for the next version of Cyanogen OS.
Cyanogen OS, the commercial cousin to the popular open source Android ROM CyanogenMod, is licensed by Cyanogen for devices such as the OnePlus One, Micromax's Yureka YU, and Alcatel's new OneTouch Hero 2+.
