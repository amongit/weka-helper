MakeSchool wants to replace traditional Computer Science (CS) education. MakeSchool is an education startup that currently offers online tutorials, a summer academy and a gap year program that helps students learn practical programming skills, and get them on their way to building cool products and working at a tech startup.
MakeSchool, which was originally named MakeGamesWithUs, was born after Ashu Desai and Jeremy Rossmann decided that they needed to fix the educational gap in CS education. A lot of their developer and programmer friends felt like they weren't really learning practical things from their CS degrees. At the same time, they also saw a skills gap between what students were learning and what companies wanted.
