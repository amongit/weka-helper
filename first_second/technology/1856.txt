USB 3.0 is now common on PCs and Macs. Its performance and backwards compatibility with earlier USB implementations makes it a winner. It isn't as stable or fast as Thunderbolt, but for casual connections to single hard drives or SSDs, it works well.
Yet it is the rare system that comes with enough USB ports, so USB hubs are popular. Ideally, a USB 3.0 hub is invisible, as if all the connected devices function as if directly attached to the system. Yet that doesn't always happen.
