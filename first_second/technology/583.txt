The whiteboard diagram below has played an important part in my life for the last few years. Drawn in more than one digital transformation and collaboration workshop session at client sites, usually by IT people who are up at night worrying about budgets and keeping their job (by their own admission), it's a pretty simple conundrum.
"If we go ahead with a new layer of technology to meet the needs of better collaboration/systems of engagement to drive towards our business goals, at what point will the new layer of technology lessen the overall cost of IT while making us more efficient and better positioned to innovate and be more agile?" By adding a new layer of IT spend on top of the existing (lower black line) in other words,when will the tipping point occur to get us back into the black and thus make us better off and more efficient than when we embarked on this effort?
