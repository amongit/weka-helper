There are endless ways to share files between devices. Some of them are complex, ftp and Network File System (NFS). Some, such as Apple Bonjour and Windows Homegroup, work with only a few operating systems. Still others, like Dropbox and Google Drive, require you to use a cloud. Then, there's BitTorrent Sync 2.0, which is easy to use, works with most devices, and doesn't use a cloud.
When you think of BitTorrent, you almost certainly think about the wildly popular Peer-to-Peer (P2P) anonymous file-protocol and the sites, such as Pirate Bay, that use it for TV and movie sharing. While the company still supports the protocol, it's also been moving into more business-friendly programs such as Sync.
