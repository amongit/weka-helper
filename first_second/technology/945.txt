HP's claims that it has "leapfrogged" EMC by deduplicating data at more than three times the rate of its fastest system have been vigorously disputed by EMC.
MB261781511 EMC said HP's decision was "puzzling", and argued the comparison was not fair because HP's claim was for four hardware systems working on four storage pools compared to EMC's figures for one system and one pool. Deduplication, which removes copies of data from storage to improve usage, only works within pools of data.
