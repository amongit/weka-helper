Good Technology announced its 10th quarterly Mobility Index report (PDF) yesterday. iOS continues to dominate mobile device activations, smaller form factors outpaced larger ones, and secure browser activations nearly tripled quarter-over-quarter.
As security failures continue to make the headlines, it is encouraging to see the most growth in secure browsers and messaging across the Good Technology client base. The report states that secure browsing represents 27 percent of all apps deployed by organization with custom business apps and secure messaging both at about 20 percent each.
