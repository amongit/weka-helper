Data leakage resulting from lost or stolen laptops is something most of us are familiar with. Equally prevalent, but less spoken of, is data leakage which originates from misplaced data storage devices such as USB flash drives or portable hard disk drives.
Of course, organizations are certainly not helpless when it comes to protecting data. Businesses can easily defend themselves on this front with highly affordable software encryption offerings such as BitLocker To Go--both the Enterprise and Ultimate versions for Windows--or the open source TrueCrypt encryption software. Some USB flash drives also come preloaded with proprietary software utility to encrypt data.
