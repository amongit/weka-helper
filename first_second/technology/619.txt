My iPhone 4 and I parted ways after I received my new iPhone 5 in June 2013 and I had no idea that things could go so wrong. If you recall, my wife bought me a new iPhone 5 for Father's Day almost two years ago. I wasn't too happy with the Lightning interface then and I'm still not on board with it now. I believe that Apple should have gone with the more reliable USB/miniUSB interface that other manufacturers use. But, that is another story, or rather was another story. This story is much different in that it is my old iPhone 4 I'm focused on in this tragic tale.
I gave my son (The Ginger Avenger) my iPhone 4 because his iPhone 3GS had seen better days (See Figure 1). Plus, I was getting the "new" iPhone 5, so who needs an old phone hanging around except for the young man who treats his phone like a Yo-Yo (I'm guessing here).
