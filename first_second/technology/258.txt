Students at a remote Ghanaian college are to become the first people in Africa able to buy internet connectivity delivered using TV white spaces, after the Ghanaian regulator granted the first licence to operate a commercial white spaces network on the continent.
The service is being made available by local networking firm Spectra Wireless. Spectra has been working with Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative to run a white spaces pilot for the last year. Through 4Afrika, Microsoft has backed similar pilot programs in South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, and the Philippines.
