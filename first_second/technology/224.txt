Two hundred members of Israel’s hi-tech industry came together at the end of September to participate in the tenth Geekcon; an annual maker event which sees attendees combine software, robotics, neuroscience, mechanical and web based technologies to build so-called "useless projects".
Innovations originating from this year's event included a hummus 3D printer, Human Pac-Man, in which players steer the online Pac-Man game through head motion; and the Bane Mask Translator, which translates English to Hebrew — and Hebrew to English — in the distinctive accent of Tom Hardy’s Bane character from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.
