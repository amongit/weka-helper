The initial release of Skype came around 10-and-a-half years ago. Although the company was founded by Dane Janus Friis and Swede Nicklas Zennström, the software was initially developed by four Estonians — three of whom were also behind the once-popular peer-to-peer sharing application Kazaa.
Just two years later, the company had become the leader in the global VoIP market with 54 million customers – 150,000 customers joining daily — and the startup was later bought by eBay for €2.6bn. Although the exact numbers have not made public, the sale brought hundreds of millions of Estonian kroons (Estonia's currency before joining the Eurozone in 2011, equal to around €0.06) to stakeholders in the country.
