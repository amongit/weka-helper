Shortly after Apple's loyal fans in Taiwan in mid October welcomed new products, the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c running iOS 7, the most significant iOS update since the original iPhone, their enthusiasm was dampened by the new map app's listing the island as "a province of China".
In addition to iOS 7, Apple released in mid September for its mobile devices, iPhones and iPads, the recently released Mac OS X Mavericks, which has been available for download for desktop and laptop users since October 23, makes the same mistake. Taiwanese users, who set the language for their devices as traditional Chinese, soon noticed that Taiwan is listed as "Taiwan Province, China" in simplified Chinese characters in the map app. In the English version, the same mistakes exist.
