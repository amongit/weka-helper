Researchers at Kaspersky Labs have detected an example of a breed of malware that uses a cross-browser plugin to create a worm that works across multiple browsers.
The LilyJade worm malware spoofs ad modules on Yahoo, YouTube, Bing, MSN, AOL, Google and Facebook. It spreads by publishing spam messages about teen popstar Justin Bieber from compromised Facebook accounts.
