Over six years ago, Tom Howard and long-time friend Fenn Bailey dreamed of an intuitive travel search experience. This came to life in 2009 in the form of Adioso, originally showing the cheapest airfares by date, but has more recently taken shape as a way for people to use more personalised categories to get where they want to go.
"Traditional travel search requires you to know your dates and destinations with precision, before you start searching," Howard said. "But what if you're willing to travel anytime in September, and go anywhere in South East Asia? To find out what your options are using current products requires lots of repetitive searches, can take hours and, because prices and availability changes every day, it becomes impossible to keep track of all the options and get the best price."
