On Sunday, more than a quarter million people gathered in New York City for the largest ever climate change protest. The next day, a number of high profile investors, including the Rockefeller family, pledged to divest a total of $50 billion from coal, oil and gas companies. The move was seen as demonstrating a commitment to lessen dependency on fossil fuels, curb greenhouse emissions and combat manmade climate change. The argument goes as follows: coal, oil and gas companies produce fossil fuels, fossil fuels produce greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gases produce climate change. Therefore, coal, oil and gas companies are responsible for climate change. Straight forward enough. But upon closer inspection, this argument falls apart.
It is inaccurate, or at least incomplete, to say that fossil fuels produce greenhouse gases. Sitting in the ground, coal, oil and gas do no such thing. Nor do they pollute (much) when they are piled in a heap, stored in a barrel, or transported in a pipe. Rather, it is the use of fossil fuels that produces greenhouse gases.
