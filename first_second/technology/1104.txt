The Philippine government has created a new website, called Foreign Aid Transparency Hub (Faith), in an attempt to make foreign aids--in terms of cash pledges and donations in kind--transparent to the public and interested parties.
This site was established as rescue and relief operations continue in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, which left thousands dead and millions displaced.
