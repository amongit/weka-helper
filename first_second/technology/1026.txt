Traditional TV, based on the three-legs of cable, satellite, and over-the-air (OTA) broadcast, received its pink slip today. Dish Network has launched its first Internet video service, Sling TV. This new $19.99 service offers viewers a variety of popular cable channels including ESPN and ESPN2.
Sling TV comes with many other formerly cable only channels -- TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, ABC Family, Disney Channel, CNN, El Rey, and Galavision. It will also be adding the movie channel AMC, ESPN3 , Maker Studios, and Polaris+, a new online gaming network to its lineup in the next few weeks. The AMC deal will also give Dish the right to broadcast BBC AMERICA, BBC World News, IFC, Sundance TV, and WE tv.
