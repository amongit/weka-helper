These days, all departments are being asked to do more and more with less and less. That's just a fact of life. What's sad, however, is that many of us are spending on things we're not using, so we have even less of less than we should.
That brings me to today's pro tip: doing an auto-renew audit. You know what I'm talking about, right? Auto-renew is that easy way to sign up for services where you keep getting service month after month, but you don't have to go through the hassle of getting your accounts payable department to write checks or manage bills. Instead, you hand over your company credit card number and everything just happens automagically.
