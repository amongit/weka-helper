I've been obsessed with building a corporate culture. When I worked at Microsoft, I took it for granted. E-mail newsletters making it easy to stay on top of updates, logos everywhere creating a feeling of identity, intranets for communication, stated company values, and etc.
A big part of culture advancement is feeling connected to your colleagues. Understanding what they're working on, why they're working on it, what challenges they're facing, and whether there are opportunities to engage help foster employee curiosity, feedback, and company well-being.
