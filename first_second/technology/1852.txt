Thereâ€™s a revolution going on in the M&A strategy rooms at some forward-looking HR software firms. In less than 48 hours, Workday has acquired Identified and Monster has acquired Gozaik and TalentBin. Almost all of these deals bring huge slices of social technology, search, in-memory databases, speed and more to the world of recruiters.
Press and analysts usually write reams of copy when software vendors buy their huge competitors but those deals, no matter what the vendors say, are just market share/install base grabs. I feel for the acquired customers in those deals.
