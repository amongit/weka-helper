Back in October 2012, we reviewed ViewSonic's 27-inch, high-resolution (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) VP-2770-LED monitor, which delivered solid professional-level image quality for £459 (ex. VAT; £550.80 inc. VAT) or $1,229. A year and a half later, ViewSonic is back with the VP2772, offering the same resolution and a similarly attractive price, but with some enhancements that further improve image quality. The ViewSonic VP2772 costs £494.99 (ex. VAT, £593.99 inc. VAT) or $1,019.99.
Outwardly, the VP2772 looks identical to its predecessor, with a matte-black chassis and sturdy tripod stand. There's plenty of adjustability, the stand supporting 120-degree swivel, -5 to 23-degree tilt and 0-150mm height settings. You can also pivot the VP2772 through 90 degrees to put the screen in portrait orientation — a useful mode for many engineers and designers. The weight of the VP2772 monitor/stand assembly is almost identical to the VP2770-LED: 8.53kg (18.8lb) versus 8.44kg (18.6lb), although the newer model has an external power brick rather than an internal power supply.
