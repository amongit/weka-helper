Given that data centres consume relatively large amounts of power they sometimes attract hostility from some quarters, particularly environmentalists. Specifically, I’m thinking of the Greenpeace report, How Dirty is Your Data that seeks to highlight the need for greater transparency from global IT operators.
While this particular report was not overtly hostile, for example, it acknowledged the many benefits of IT and was even handed in its approach, it did highlight some startling facts. For example, it cited a new data centre in the US run by a well known technology vendor that was tipped to consume up to 100 MW of electricity. To put that in context, that’s about 80,000 US homes, or 250,000 homes in the European Union.
