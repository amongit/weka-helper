Microsoft is making available a preview version of its Azure HDInsight (Hadoop on Azure) service running on Linux as of February 18.
Like its Windows counterpart, the HDInsight on Linux service is built on top of the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). HDInsight includes full compatibility with Apache Hadoop, as well as integration with Microsoft's own business-intelligence tools, such as Excel, SQL Server and PowerBI. And as it does with the Windows version, Microsoft plans to contribute back code it developed for the Linux HDInsight version to the Apache community, company officials said.
