Tesla’s stock price hit a pothole early Tuesday but zoomed ahead to a record high later in the day -- and it's still climbing.
Despite a Consumer Reports review published Monday saying the electric carmaker's Model S luxury sedan “had more than its share of problems,” shares in the electric carmaker closed above $262 on Tuesday evening. By late Wednesday morning, the stock hovered around $264.
