I may not have a muse but I love to muse. I let those random thoughts float through my feverish brain and at some point they get organized enough to be put down on paper – albeit the digital version. It sort of follows a form of writing and a practice that I learned many years ago called “automatic writing” popularized by the Surrealist movement – no, they weren’t just painters. There was an actual political, social, and cultural component to surrealism. (If you want to read their manifesto, check out Andre Breton’s “Surrealist Manifesto”).
Automatic writing called for you to write down the first blush of your unadorned thoughts. In effect, whatever came to mind. Then the way that you refined and edited it was by writing the second, third, fourth, etc., pass of your thoughts “over” it. If I remember correctly (and I may not) the thinking was that the second pass, even though it was what came to mind as opposed to editing the original scrivening, was “aware” of the first attempt and that connection impacted the second, third and fourth ad infinitum passes. Ultimately, you got a vividly written and highly refined work that wasn’t bound by the rules of editing but was bound only by the mind’s imagination as connected to the work you started. Try it sometimes. It's fun and it works.
