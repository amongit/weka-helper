Last week I had a typical conversation with a very successful IT executive. I had just presented benefits of a cloud computing solution, and he was excited about it, but explained he wouldnâ€™t be able to start for a couple of years.
He had just signed a lease for more datacenter space, and he had tons of equipment on his books. He was worried that some of his critical applications might break if he made any sudden changes. His predicament is common, and so was his conclusion.
