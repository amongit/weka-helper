I look at a lot of analytics products. And whether they self-categorize as BI, Big Data, analytics, dashboard or data visualization tools, they tend to overlap quite a bit in functionality.
The product descriptions and rhetoric overlap even more. "Offering actionable insights for better decisions from your organization's competitive weapon: its data." "Making insights available to everyone in the company, not just specialists." Sound familiar?
