The Netherlands' largest telco KPN is facing a â‚¬300,000 fine after failing to comply with an order from the country's consumer watchdog to let business customers end their contracts without charge.
The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets creates (ACM) is seeking the fine from Dutch incumbent KPN after the company failed to properly implement changes that ACM ordered last year.
