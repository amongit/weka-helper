In a bid to bridge the gap between the lab and the fab, researchers in the US are working on understanding the complex interactions in the junctions between Wundermaterial graphene and the metal connectors that would hook it up to the rest of a circuit.
Graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon with a long list of seriously amazing properties , has huge potential for use in electronics. But as Salvador Barraza-Lopez, assistant professor of physics at Georgia Tech, said in a statement, "If you want to use graphene for devices, you want to understand what will happen with metal contacts".
