Storage growth is out of control! Practically everyone has awakened to the reality that information is a key differentiator in business. Even if they don’t know how to analyze the data yet, they are collecting it because stored data is like money in the bank. However, just as it costs something to keep money in the bank (those huge vaults aren’t cheap), storing data has its costs too.
It’s easy for the business to underestimate the expenses of storing data. After all, disks are getting cheaper by the month. But what users often don’t realize is that they also need to backup and maintain all that content. And these operational costs add up when you have enormous quantities of data.
