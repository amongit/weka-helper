Picking a printer? There are more options than just laser and ink-jet.
Although there have been a few other technologies over the years (like melting wax blocks), inkjet and laser printers dominate the market. And it's usually easy to choose between them. If you want a cheap printer, you get an inkjet. If you want a printer that's cheap to use, you get a laser printer, because toner is more economical than inkjet cartridges. If you want good photo printing, an ink jet gives you better results. If you want fast printing, a laser printer usually wins.
