Motorola's Moto G, announced just six months ago in November 2013 , quickly proved to be the best-selling smartphone in the company's history, thanks to its combination of a solid specification and an affordable price (£135/€169/$179 SIM-free at launch). Our review of the original Moto G (now available from around £119), concluded that "If you're looking to equip a workforce with a basic Android phone, it's arguably the best choice currently available".
Encouraged by the Moto G's success, Motorola today launched a two-pronged follow-up. With IDC estimating the average global selling price for a smartphone in 2013 at £199 ($337), the new Moto E pushes the smartphone price envelope into 'feature phone' territory at just £89. Meanwhile, the Moto G gets an upgrade, adding LTE connectivity and a MicroSD card slot for storage expansion.
