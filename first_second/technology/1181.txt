Researchers have developed a new fabrication process that allows for the precise creation of a graphene hybrid with potential uses in the electronic industry.
Ever since its discovery in 2004, graphene — the single layer of carbon atoms flaked off from a piece of everyday graphite pencil — has been big news. Among its many extraordinary properties is its conductivity, which at about 100 times that of copper triggered much excitement about what the material might do for electronics.
