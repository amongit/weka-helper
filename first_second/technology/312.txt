Finland is to start work on an online service channel and a digital ID system "without delay", as part of a new programme (PDF) revealed by the country's government recently.
The plan was first brought to wider public attention last week when Riku Jylh√§nkangas, the head of Finland's public sector ICT strategy, told the European State Portals event in Tallinn that Finland is going to study Estonia's own middleware layer X-Road in order to build its own system, which it hopes will improve public service delivery and cut costs.
