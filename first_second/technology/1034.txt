Las Vegas -- I love my Linksys WRT1900AC, but with a $279 price-tag, some small-office/home-office (SOHO) and small businesses are reluctant to open their wallets for it. Now, at CES, Belkin, Linksys's parent company, is introducing a new lower-priced 802.11ac Wi-Fi router: The WRT1200AC Dual Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router for $179.99
For a hundred bucks less you also get less of a Wi-Fi router. Instead of a 3x3 MIMO antenna rig, the new WRT1200AC comes with 2x2 MIMO. Otherwise the pair are closer in specifications than you might expect.
