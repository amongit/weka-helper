Are customers asking the right questions of their cloud providers? A conversation I had recently with managed services firm Star's chief customer officer, Martino Corbelli, suggests they are not.
According to Corbelli, the UK's mid-sized companies — the bulk of his customers have between 100 and 1,000 employees — are getting stuck in what he calls bad relationships with their cloud services provider because they lack either the management and negotiation skills to handle problems with the relationship, or enough money to cover the cost of getting out.
