At the Strata conference in Santa Clara today, Israeli BI company SiSense announced a highly revamped version of its core in-chip analytics/self-service data discovery product. SiSense, which claims 600 customers in 49 countries, won last year's Strata Audience Award. In 2013, the company also tripled its sales and nabbed $10 million in funding.
Originally known as Prism, the now eponymously branded SiSense product combines vector processing, self-service analytics, and a revamped user interface that presents handsome visualizations and a very clean use of type.
