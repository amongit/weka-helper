Last weekend, I stayed at an island over four hours by ferry from Auckland. Petrol was more than NZ$3 per litre at one of the two gas stations I saw, and in the handful of little shops, food certainly cost far more than it does in the supermarkets back in Auckland.
But were the retailers ripping off Great Barrier's 700 or so residents, as shopping around is somewhat difficult for them, or did their prices actually reflect the cost of bringing those supplies to the island?
