The upper house of the Netherlands parliament adopted on Tuesday a new Telecommunications Act, making the country the first in Europe to put net neutrality into law. The lower house approved the act in June last year.
MB261993792 According to Dutch news site www.volkscrant.nl [in Dutch], the law follows an intense national debate in 2011, after mobile operator KPN started to charge for access to WhatsApp, a free online service that sends text messages. The new law specifies that no carrier can impose charges or special conditions for any internet service, nor can they determine what sites their users can visit. However, court-ordered site blocking can still take place.
