ZeroTurnaround is one Estonia's most promising startups, recently landing â‚¬6m in growth capital from investors including VC firm Bain Capital Ventures.
ZeroTurnaround is making its mark in the field of Java productivity tools, with two products: JRebel and LiveRebel. JRebel is a tool which allows the developers to instantly view code changes to a Java app in the browser, so there's no need to redeploy the application server, while LiveRebel lets operations teams eliminate server downtime during live-app updates.
