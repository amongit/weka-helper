The Hungarian government’s decision to tax internet traffic in the country saw more than 10,000 people stage a demonstration against the move on Sunday.
The protestors marched through the centre of Budapest to demand the ruling Fidesz party withdraw the draft bill. If passed into law, the tax will significiantly affect not only the country’s economy, but education and freedom of expression as well, protesters say.
