One of the stranger decisions that Microsoft made when developing Windows 8 was that the new model of building apps was to be based not on .NET, but rather on a new development technology called Windows Runtime (WinRT).
The real reason why this decision was made has never been officially confirmed. A theory held by common folk is that Steven Sinofsky had an axe to grind against .NET having blamed it for "that whole Vista thing". Personally, that's a theory I subscribe to .
