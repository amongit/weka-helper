There has been a small wave of panic lately to the end that cloud computing signals the death knell for traditional IT workers. The perception is that enterprise job openings such as server administrators, database administrators and infrastructure and network people are likely to become far fewer given that the cloud provides these services in cost-effective and flexible ways.
But before any IT worker reading this is gripped with terror, I need to point out that it’s not likely to happen any time soon, as ubiquitous clouds are probably about five to ten years away. And more fundamentally it’s not as if IT roles will disappear into a vacuum. The cloud will require new technology skills, and I see cloud computing providing a basis for IT’s more strategic contribution. Which means IT workers will spend less time on that old phrase ‘keeping the lights on’ and more on innovation.
