Fruition Partners, one of ServiceNow's elite Master Partners and cloud integration partners, has leveraged its expertise in the cloud-based service management platform to create an "App Factory" that helps healthcare organizations approach mandated updates to legacy applications more methodically.
Its new Healthcare Management Suite is targeted at healthcare payors and providers, and is specifically focused on helping them cope with ICD-10 compliance regulations for international coding standards. The suite includes a testing module to help these organizations determine which workflows and applications are ready for the conversion or whether they will have to deal with this manually.
