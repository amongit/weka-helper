It isn't often that I look at a new product and say, "Now that's cool enough to write about", but the Pi Vessel is such a product. The Pi Vessel is a small computer designed for multimedia, gaming, entertainment, and personal computing. The proposed delivery date for the first Pi Vessels is December 2014. The Kickstarter campaign is underway and ready for funding.
I think the Pi Vessel is a small entry-level computer or an entertainment computer for people who don't want a lot of hassle to get up and running fast. It's great for kids or for people who want to watch TV and movies without a long setup time, downloading software, putting together a console, reading instructions, or fussing about with complex cables and gadgets. The Pi Vessel is simple, affordable, and kid proof.
