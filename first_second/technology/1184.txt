It is not just about the Higgs, you know. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, otherwise known as the biggest and most powerful particle accelerator ever built, is being used to paint the clearest picture yet of the earliest moments of the universe's existence. Part of that puzzle is about the hunt for the Higgs boson, but there are plenty of other areas of interest.
