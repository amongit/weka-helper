Every time another one of Edward Snowden's leaked documents comes out, I'm met with a barrage of "How is this even new? Privacy died ages ago", or "How can they even do this?! Those jerks are taking this too far!". Editorially, I've been just as conflicted. On one hand, my peers (which are typically no stranger to privacy issues) have questioned the validity of covering such news about diplomatic facilities being used to spy on foreign nations given it should be a no-brainer. On the other hand, in news coverage, we've sometimes taken the view of informing readers that the "latest and greatest" controversial leak simply reaffirms what we already knew, but is important to know.
The problem is, none of the people who have the most impact in doing anything about it seem to have any understanding of how rampant the issue is. They either don't want anything to happen because it's to their advantage, or they are unaware. Who am I talking about? Try Australian Ambassador to Indonesia Greg Moriarty, Australian and Indonesian foreign ministers Julie Bishop and Marty Natalegawa, and US and Australian country leaders Barack Obama and Tony Abbott.
