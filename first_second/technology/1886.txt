This week's case in point comes in a New Zealand government report following the leakage of public data from customer "kiosks" placed in the offices of Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ), the Kiwi equivalent of Australia's Centrelink.
At the time the story broke, junior staff within WINZ were blamed, with the head of the Ministry of Social Development accusing WINZ of having "slack and sloppy" processes.
