I spent much of last week in the depths of a Barcelona conference center at TechEd Europe , catching up with Microsoft staff and talking about the future of Microsoft's enterprise business. There's a lot to report back on, particularly around how Redmond is managing the transition from a predominantly on-premise model to one focused on the cloud.
That makes this TechEd a fascinating event, with a company presenting far-reaching changes in its client and server offerings to an inherently conservative audience of IT professionals. It's not that Microsoft's customers don't want to change - like you they're fascinated by technology and its promises - but on the whole they're working for businesses that move relatively slowly, and that can't take the risks associated with a wholesale transition to the cloud.
