Two foreign technology companies have expanded their operations in the Philippines, giving the country some positive news amid difficult times. While the investments may seem relatively modest, they are indications that foreign market players are still optimistic about the prospects of investing in the Philippines.
First up is Japanese company SMK Electronics, which recently announced it was pouring in US$20 million (940 million pesos) to expand its operations inside the Clark Freeport. The site is one of the business hubs outside Metro Manila housing many technology companies.
