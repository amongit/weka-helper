Adam Osborne is remembered as the inventor of the Osborne 1, the world's first portable computer. What people tend to forget is that Osborne himself never considered the Osborne 1 to be his most influential innovation.
For Osborne the breakthrough was not the computer - he felt that at that time, 1981, the development of the personal computer was inevitable - but the idea of bundling with the computer all of of the software that you would ever need to run your business.
