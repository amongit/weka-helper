One company that I've come across has come up with a pretty good basis for a definition of digital in their marketing literature. Cognizant describes digital as "SMAC" â€” i.e., social mobile, analytics, and cloud.
However, to get a little way away from marketing spiel, and to add some extra bits, let's take SMAC as a root and extend it. To those four we'll add consumerisation of IT, and a specific mention of big data. Together, those six things should form a decent basis for describing what digital is when it comes to the commercial realities of how to introduce it into the business.
