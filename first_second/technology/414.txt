A big selling point for cloud computing is what's become known as cloud bursting. What this means is the ability to move spikes in demand for computing resources into the cloud, rather than having to build infrastructure to cope with peak loads. You only pay for what you need, in other words.
It's a bit like having an alternative supplier for commuter trains in the rush hour although -- if the analogy will stretch this far -- having to go to an alternative station to catch one.
