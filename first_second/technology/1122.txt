Art, design, and media are not new to infocomm and engineering. Convergence is not new to infocomm and engineering. But I was still pleased to learn that a Singapore university has a program where art, design, and media have been added to its classical engineering course.
In Singapore, many engineering courses have typically involved much software. We tend to refer to infocomm/engineering as a set. The art, design, and media schools and industries in Singapore have long been using infocomm tools. But it was rarer to find infocomm/engineering people getting their hands dirty with art, design, and media.
