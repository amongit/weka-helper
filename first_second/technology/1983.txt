South by Southwest (SXSW) is in full swing. Every year, 150,000 musicians, techies, filmmakers, luminaries and generally curious folk descend upson Austin, Texas. "Southby" has exploded over the years, buoyed in part by iconic startup launches such as Twitter.
Over the years, the conference has tapped in to key consumer trends. These days, we love to create and to share -- and we're living in great times to do both. (Perhaps we often overshare and later regret it, but that's a different story altogether.) Because of ubiquitous smartphones, cloud computing and new business models such as Kickstarter, it has never been easier to do both. We're only a reach away from increasingly powerful cameras and video recorders. Who could have predicted the rise of the citizen journalist 15 years ago? And artists can do things that were simply not possible even five years ago.
