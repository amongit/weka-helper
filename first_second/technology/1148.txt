Adobe's Creative Cloud (CC), the subscription-based bundle of downloadable desktop applications, mobile apps and online services for creative professionals, today receives a major update. The 2014 CC refresh includes: 'milestone' upgrades to 14 desktop applications; new 'connected' mobile apps; Adobe-branded creative hardware; new ways for creative pros to access and share their 'creative profile'; a new permanent subscription package for photographers and updated packages for education and enterprise customers.
Setting the scene for the 2014 CC update in a briefing in London last week, Adobe evangelist Rufus Deuchler noted that 'mobility' for creative professionals doesn't just mean content consumption: increasingly, their customers expect them to be 'super-connected', toting mobile devices that are 'instruments of creation' rather than just consumption. Another key requirement is for creative pros to have their 'creative profile' available online, so they can access assets, share their work, receive feedback and participate in community workflows.
