Apple didn't call out the new iPad's most striking internal feature during the launch, but from an engineering viewpoint it is extraordinary for one standout component.
Teardowns reveal that the battery capacity has been doubled to more than 40 watt-hours. As chemistry doesn't move at the same speed as Moore's Law, that means it's practically twice the size of its immediate ancestor's â€” the iPad 3 is basically one huge battery with a rather nice display attached.
