After introducing the first version of the Microsoft fitness Band four months ago Microsoft is delivering some new software and service features, as well as a preview of the developer kit for the device.
(Before anyone asks, I have no information on if/when Microsoft plans to restock the version one Bands or if/when the company plans to make available a second-generation Band.)
