Watching Xiaomi roll out its line-up of phones is like watching the Harry Potter series of films unleashed on Potter-crazed, giddy schoolchildren desperate for their fix. Xiaomi will hope that its coffers fill up with billions of dollars as speedily as it did for Warner Brothers, producer of the Potter series, but, so far, the Chinese brand hasn't done too shabbily in India.
In fact, it has done sensationally. Xiaomi has sold more phones through the internet in India -- specifically, the Redmi 1S, the Redmi Note, and the Mi3 -- faster than any brand to date in the last six months through exclusive sales via Flipkart. And from all accounts, Xiaomi is just warming up, since it's been holding back volumes by dribbling out phones in the tens of thousands.
