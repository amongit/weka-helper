Google is killing off further work and security patches for Chrome on Android 4.0, known as Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), which it released in 2011.
Google has announced that Chrome version 42 will be the last update it delivers for Android ICS. That version of Android was the first to see Chrome run on mobile devices. It laid the groundwork for Chrome to replace the older Android browser as the default for the Google OS, which happened with the release of KitKat in 2013.
