Some entrepreneurs would give their first prototype to replicate Roamz's two-year journey — $3.5 million investment, 140,000 downloads and a dozen staff — but unsatisfied founder Jonathan Barouch has killed his darling so that he can realise his dream to "engineer serendipity".
In a fortnight, he will release a new version of Roamz, which he has built from scratch. Roamz analyses social media content to recommend popular services and events in a user's proximity, eg a new coffee shop or Vivid live events.
