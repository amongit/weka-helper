One of the first Apple 1 computers has gone under the hammer at auctioneer Bonhams for a shade under $1m.
That's a lot of money for a few bits of wood, plastic and metal, but it is fair to say that while $905,000 (£563,904) is a lot of money, the Apple 1's place in the pantheon of IT history — alongside that of its designer, Steve Wozniak — should be somewhere very close to the front.
