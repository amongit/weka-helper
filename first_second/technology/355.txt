The first direct subsea fiber optic cable to link New York with the Brazilian city of SÃ£o Paulo has successfully been funded and will be ready by the end of 2016.
At a total project cost of $500m, the Seabras-1 link will be developed by Seaborn Networks. According to one of the project's main backers, private investment fund Partners Group, the cable network has already sold "substantial capacity" - including Microsoft and Tata Communications, which contracted with Seaborn as first customers of the Brazil-US network.
