Before inviting a guest to appear on CXO-Talk, I consider two questions. First, is this person shaping the future of technology and business? And, second, will this guest add significant, unmistakable value to the CXO-Talk community?
The Chief Strategy Officer of salesforce.com, Michael Lazerow, meets both these criteria with ease. As a senior executive with salesforce, he contributes to marketing-related thought leadership across the enterprise industry; in addition, as a serial entrepreneur and investor, he is influential in the startup community. Lazerow is also a photographer and genuinely nice person, all of which makes him perfect for CXO-Talk.
