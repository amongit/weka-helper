Starting March 1, Microsoft is making available its bundle of mobile-management technologies available to small and mid-size businesses (SMBs).
Up until now, that bundle, the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) was available for purchase only by larger customers via Enterprise Agreement licensing. As of today, however, EMS is now available under Open volume-licensing, as well. Microsoft reseller partners can sell EMS to SMB, and also get access to EMS for their own use as part of their Internal Use Rights benefits.
