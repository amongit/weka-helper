Maptia founders Dorothy Sanders, Jonny Miller, and Dean Fischer met at University, where they found themselves united by a passion for exploring and a mutual frustration at the "struggle to find a beautiful and simple way to share stories from our travels."
After helping found a student travel magazine, the team soon questioned if there wasn't a better model. "After that, it wasn't long before the idea of building a giant, interactive, map of stories from every single place on the planet was born," Sanders, Maptia's CEO and designer, told ZDNet.
