The marketshare of BlackBerry has reduced to such a point that Kantar has stopped reporting explicitly on the Canadian handset maker. In the latest edition of its Worldpanel smartphone OS marketshare survey, the former enterprise mobility giant is lumped into the Others category with bedfellows such as Symbian, Firefox OS, and Windows Mobile.
As of the survey's May 2014 installment, the last one to call out BlackBerry's marketshare, the best territory for the company formally known as RIM was Italy, where it could claim 1.4 percent of the market, followed by the US with 1.3 percent, and the UK with 1.1 percent making it the only other place worldwide surveyed where its marketshare was above the 1 percent mark.
