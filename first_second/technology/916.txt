The U.K. government is to go back to the drawing board with its plans to monitor U.K. Web, email and call traffic, after the leader of the government's coalition partner called for a "rethink" to the bill.
The move was expected after reports surfaced earlier late last month that the Liberal Democrat leader and U.K. deputy prime minister Nick Clegg was gearing up to block the bill if necessary, according to sources speaking to the BBC.
