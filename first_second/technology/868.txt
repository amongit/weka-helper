The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC) at Bletchley Park has opened a new display featuring the reconstruction of EDSAC, one the world's most influential computers. The original EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) was built at the University of Cambridge just after World War II, and formed the basis of LEO (Lyons Electronic Office), the world's first business computer.
A team of about 20 volunteers led by Andrew Herbert has been working on the EDSAC reconstruction for about two years, and the project should be completed next year. There's now enough of the machine to interest visitors. In the future, young people will be encouraged to write programs for the sort of machine that, according to computer historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, marked the beginnings of computer programming.
