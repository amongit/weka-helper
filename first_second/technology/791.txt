The king of the castle has a new tormentor.
IBMâ€™s Trusteer researchers have discovered a new configuration of the Citadel malware that attacks certain password managers. The configuration activates key logging when certain processes are running on the infected machine. The malware is designed to steal the "master password" that protects access to the database of the end-user's passwords.
