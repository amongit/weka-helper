Digital has taken Hollywood by storm. Almost all indie movies - those produced outside the big studios - are shot on digital cameras, such as the Red or Blackmagic cinema cameras. Offering 4k resolution and impressive dynamic range, these digital cameras offer capabilities rivaling traditional 35mm film.
Rival, yes, replace, no, according to such major directors such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Christopher Nolan. If pressed, most film makers would admit that digital's big advantage is economic, not artistic.
