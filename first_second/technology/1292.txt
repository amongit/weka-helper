Samsung will be holding its next Unpacked event on 1 March and it's likely we will see the Galaxy S6. Rumors indicate Samsung will use metal, similar to what we see on the Note 4 and Note Edge.
The Samsung Galaxy Alpha has a fit and finish similar to the Note Edge, but in a much more pocketable size. I hope we see some of the design elements from the Galaxy Alpha on the next core Samsung Galaxy smartphone, especially after using a Galaxy Alpha for the last week.
