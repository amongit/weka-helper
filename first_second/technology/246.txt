What can you do if there's no ISP willing to bring internet connectivity to where you live? Simple: get out and build your own ISP. That's just what the people of Verrua Savoia, a small Italian rural village not far from Turin, did.
In late November, they announced the birth of the Associazione Senza fili, Senza Confini (Association without wires, without borders), a group charged with the task of bringing internet access to the 1,400 residents of the hilly, 32-square-kilometer municipality.
