At the Mobile World Congress (MWC), Audience, maker of audio components for mobile devices, has unveiled the N100. The new chipset goes beyond audio, interacting with multiple sensors in mobile devices to determine what the user is doing at any given time. It does this with a hands-free method by always monitoring what the device is doing.
Audience is the mobile tech company you've probably never heard of, as it makes components for phones and tablets. It produces chipsets that sit between a phone's microphone and processor, providing clean audio for better speech recognition. It is a growing company, with components installed in over half a billion devices. It has partnerships with China Mobile and ZTE, among others.
