Today, Adaptive Insights, a corporate performance management (CPM) vendor, announced the placement of Tom Bogan as CEO. Founder & Chairman, Rob Hull, will remain as chairman of the company. Adaptive has been around since 2003 and makes a number of cloud, multi-tenant, in-memory financial accounting applications. Their applications are favorites with firms needing better forecasting, predictive, budgeting, planning and other tools. Their in-memory/big data capabilities let finance and other users utilize operational and other data as part of their reporting mix.
The CPM space is currently a very bright, hot space in the financial/accounting software world. Firms like Adaptive, Anaplan, Host Analytics and Tidemark are just some of the players experiencing rapid growth, increasing revenues and large customer acquisitions with their cloud applications. With this growth, some of these firms may initiate public offerings or attract potential M&A suitors. Who would want a CPM vendor? Large ERP firms, looking to bolster their anemic cloud credentials would find a good CPM vendor to be a solid cloud resume builder. Likewise, cloud ERP vendors would find these solutions particularly attractive, too. What CPM vendors generally offer these suitors are lots of cloud customers, cloud revenues and modern technology that are generally accretive to their more traditional financial software offerings (e.g., accounts payable, general ledger, etc.).
