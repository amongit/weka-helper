Lenovo has made its intentions very clear: It wants to dominate the Indian smartphone market, and it wants to do so fast. This Chinese computer maker was always known more for its laptops more than anything else, rising to become the largest computer maker in the world a few years ago. Recently, though, it is garnering attention for the steady inroads that it has been making in attempting to repeat the same feat in the smartphone market.
A few days ago, it unveiled the A6000 in India, a device that hopes to impress Indians by not only its ultra low cost, at Rs 6,999 ($113) for its impressive specifications (Digital Dolby speakers, 720p display, 5-inch screen, 1.2GHz Snapdragon 410 quad-core 64-bit processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB storage, 8MP main camera, and 2MP selfie camera), but also because it sports next-gen 4G technology.
