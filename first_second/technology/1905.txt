Recycling is critically important, but it's only one part of a larger, globally emergent environmental paradigm known as the Circular Economy.
As we look forward to America Recycles Day, we are reminded that we have so much more to do. The Global Footprint Network estimates that we have far exceeded the Earth's capacity to sustain our current levels of consumption in its recent Living Planet Report. While our industry, carton packaging, has been driving substantial efforts to expand carton recycling in the U.S., we need more than recycling to help "supply" meet "demand."
