While it's typically the latest cutting-edge technologies like 3D printers and wearable tech that gets the most attention and buzz these days, it's actually the newer IT workhorses of the enterprise that get the job done. Video conferencing, unified communications, and smart mobile devices, while not nearly as exciting as the newest advances, have steadily revamped our workplaces recently and given us much better tools to stay connected with our co-workers and customers. Even enterprise social media is finally seeing widespread adoption and meaningful usage in many workplaces.
It's no secret, however, that consumer tech advances far faster than our workplaces. The typical worker today often has more sophisticated technology at home than they do at their desk. With tech-savvy millennials becoming the vast majority of workers by 2020, our employees often just bring the latest apps, devices, and even datasets from home to get the job done, leading to the consumerization dilemma of the last several years.
