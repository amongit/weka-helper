Researchers at MIT have built complex electronic components from the graphene-like two-dimensional form of molybdenum disulphide, or MoS2.
Graphene, a two-dimensional lattice of carbon atoms, is essentially a single layer of the familiar material graphite. After its discovery in 2004, a new gold rush began as scientists began searching for other two-dimensional materials that might exhibit similarly useful properties.
