Steve Blank is among the most respected authors and teachers in the world on the topic of modern startups. His work at Stanford, Columbia, and NYU is a global model for entrepreneurial education. Beyond that, the U.S. National Science Foundation Innovation Corps uses Steveâ€™s approach as an important foundation for technology transfer between the federal government and the private sector.
I invited Steve to participate as a guest on the CXO-Talk series and share his experience. If you care about these topics, then be sure to watch the entire conversation.
