Earlier this year, Mark Russinovich, a Microsoft Technical Fellow who works on Azure, released Rogue Code - but not rogue code. It's the third techno-thriller in a trilogy based on Jeff Aiken, the main character in Zero Day and Trojan Horse.
Each book is based on computer-related threats to modern society. The main ones in Rogue Code are rootkits and back doors, though you could probably include the whole field of high-frequency trading (HFT). This is the process by which "algos" (algorithms) trade billions of dollars worth of stocks at high speed in order to exploit very small price differentials.
