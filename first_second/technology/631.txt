The Built in Spiceworks program is an initiative aimed at helping stealth mode and early-stage startup technology brands like Obliterase test and validate their products and services with a select group of IT professionals before public launch. Obliterase launched its app in the Spiceworks App Store as a fully integrated product.
Obliterase for Spiceworks is the app that's fully integrated into Spiceworks, but it's also a standalone application that performs Department of Defense grade data erasure.
