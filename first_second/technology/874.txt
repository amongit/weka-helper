BT finally launched its Next Generation Text Relay service in the UK today, Monday, to make it easier for people with hearing and speech impairments to make phone calls. The new service enables users to send and receive text over a computer link — a PC, or a free app for Apple iOS and Android 4 tablets and smartphones — while talking on a mobile phone or landline connection.
BT says: "Users can link a TextNumber, which looks like a standard phone number, to their home, work or mobile number so that when someone dials the TextNumber the call is automatically connected to the NGT service without the need for a caller to dial a special prefix."
