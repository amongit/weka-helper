Earlier this year, my natural curiosity – and the frustration of an out-of-warranty iPhone that was starting to behave erratically – led me to switch to a borrowed Nokia 1020 for what became nearly three months.
As a big photographer I was naturally excited to get familiar with the phone's now-legendary 41MP sensor, and it was indeed excellent. Colours were rich, the flash superb, the zoom allowing for an unparalleled degree of detail in images. Nokia knows its market too, offering a purpose-built camera grip into which the camera slips.
