Thinkersmith has reviewed the research and observed students from kindergarteners to undergrads, and have developed our own guidelines that serve us well for classes and camps.
In general, Thinkersmith recommends that students spend no more time sitting in front of a computer than you would expect them to be able to sit still for a book. If, for example, a kindergartener would comfortably listen to their teacher read for fifteen to twenty minutes, then that should also be the time limit for a kindergartener's computer activity.
