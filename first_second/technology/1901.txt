September's UN Climate Summit 2014 in New York City--the largest-ever--brought welcome momentum and renewed ambition to our quest to transition to a lower carbon society. The 310,000 participants who took to the streets, staging a historic People's Climate March, proved there is more support for change than ever. A comment on CNN from one protester--"we want to get to a 100 percent clean energy power society and economy"--became a compelling mantra.
Today, the 20th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is taking place in Peru until Dec. 12--and not a moment too soon. On Nov. 21, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the global average temperature over land and ocean surfaces from January-October 2014 was the highest since records began in 1880.
