Enterprise architects should stop operating as if they are x-ray technicians, and more as doctors -- diagnosing and prescribing solutions for enterprise problems, versus building models that only serve as temporal snapshots of the situation.
That's the word from John A. Zachman, creator of the highly regarded Zachman Framework, in a series of interviews posted at the site of iCMG, an EA services firm. In a fascinating and provocative discussion with Sunil Dutt Jha,CEO of iCMG, Zachman compared enterprise architecture to medicine. Too many of today's EAs are not taking on the roles of doctors as they should be, he opined.
