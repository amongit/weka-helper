Ecommerce is a complex, convoluted thing. What started as a way of putting catalogues online has now become something much more involved. In the past we built ecommerce engines out of databases, with a little shopping cart magic wrapped around them. We generated static content for Google to search, and redirected users to our dynamic sites as soon as they clicked on a link. Manual curation was the watchword, much like the paper catalogues the web had replaced.
That's all changed, thanks to the same machine learning and cloud-scale processes that have grown out of the world of search. I recently spent some time chatting to BloomReach's CEO, Raj De Datta, about how these technologies are changing ecommerce site development.
