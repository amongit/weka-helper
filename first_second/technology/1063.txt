At some point in the recent past at Apple headquarters, a room of middle-aged business heads decided that the band that best reflected Apple, or would be most welcomed by iTunes users, was a certain effects-driven Irish band called U2, which was once described by Henry Rollins as having the worst rhythm section in big rock.
Musical tastes and snobbery aside, the backlash against Apple's decision to offer U2's latest album for free has not been a case of looking a gift horse in the mouth, nor scathing criticism that users received the wrong free thing, but rather disagreement at the mechanism by which Apple chose to deliver the music.
