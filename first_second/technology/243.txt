Apple, Google, Amazon, and French game developer Gameloft have reached an agreement with the Italian competition watchdog (Autorit√† Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, or AGCM, in Italian) to revise their policies on 'freemium' applications downloaded from their online stores.
Such apps, usually games, are free to download initially, but allow users to buy access to extra features using cash. According to AGCM, the way such apps are marketed is potentially misleading, especially to children, who may be more susceptible to advertisements and other forms of purchase stimulation than experienced users.
