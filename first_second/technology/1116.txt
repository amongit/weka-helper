As infocomm professionals, we can get our infocomm competencies valued by independent bodies, such as the Singapore National Infocomm Competency Framework (NICF) certification.
Infocomm professionals in Singapore are still very much valued by the big brand employers they have worked for or the big brand customers they have serviced. Certification of infocomm expertise, whether for proprietary technologies or international standards, can cost as much as about one month's pay.
