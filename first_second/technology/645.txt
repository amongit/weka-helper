As soon as Amazon announced the Echo -- the device that's part Bluetooth speaker, part Jetson's robot, and part NSA front end (kidding!) -- I wanted one. I've been doing a lot of experimentation with speech control, and I've been very curious about what could be done with the Echo.
Sadly, I only recently got an invitation to purchase the product, and Amazon won't promise anything sooner than May or June, so I can only speculate. On the other hand, my ZDNet buddy James Kendrick is one of the anointed few who has one, and his Echo has even had a feature upgrade. James said his Echo responds to the name Alexa.
