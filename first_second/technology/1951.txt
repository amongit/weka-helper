For the first time in history, eradicating extreme poverty around the world is on the horizon, according to one campaign for progress -- and 2015 is a pivotal year in achieving it.
Launched on Thursday, Action/2015 is garnering participation from more than 1,000 organizations in 125 countries. Groups supporting a variety of causes -- spanning from human rights to environmental and faith sectors -- have joined the movement, with plans to meet in locations around the world and via online platforms throughout the year to discuss how goals can be met in combating poverty.
