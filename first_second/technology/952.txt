Amazon has broadened Windows compatibility in the Amazon Web Services cloud, bringing SQL Server to its database service and adding .NET language support to its Elastic Beanstalk platform.
The compatibility improvements were announced by Amazon on Tuesday. They are part of a push by the cloud computing giant to "simplify the Windows development experience on AWS," Jeff Barr, a cloud computing senior manager for Amazon wrote in a blog post.
