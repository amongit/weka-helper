The world of enterprise online communities is one of the more interesting phenemona of social business. For one, it's not considered very glamorous, attached as it is typically to older, less exciting traditional businesses. Nor are they on the cutting edge of high technology, often making use of simple social tools like online forums.
But in their own way, online communities have been one of the unsung heros of digital business, steadily engaging a growing cast of millions of employees, customers, and business partners around the world in often-immense online groups of shared interest, both within companies and across the Internet. These communities communicate and collaborate with each other for mutual support, to share ideas, and even co-create to achieve longer term strategic goals.
