This Thursday, ZDNet UK is upping sticks and abandoning our London offices. We will become a touring machine and run the site, hopefully as normal, from The National Museum Of Computing at Bletchley Park.
We're doing this for a number of reasons. One is that, with the Olympics coming, we want to find out what it's like to take a team of people and do our everyday work from somewhere outside London with just Wi-Fi and power laid on. Another is that it's good to know these things for disaster recovery planning: you only know if something works by doing it.
