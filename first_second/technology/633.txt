Spacemonger, by Edgerunner, is a Windows utility that presents your storage to you in graphical format so that you can see, at a glance, what's burning your space. It is a locally installed application that quickly shows you your local disk, shared storage, and cloud storage capacity and file list in a single sweep. Spacemonger is also advertised as being six times faster than the free WinDirStat.
I could go through all of the various features for you, but if you want to find out exactly how Spacemonger works on all levels, check out the nine video presentations that explain Spacemonger's by someone who really knows the application.
