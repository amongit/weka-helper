Norway's competition watchdog has green-lighted TeliaSonera's acquisition of Tele2.
Norway's second largest mobile operator TeliaSonera announced plans to acquire smaller rival Tele2 for SEK 5.1bn (â‚¬540m) in July last year, a move that would have left the country with two mobile operators in charge of over 90 percent of the country's mobile market.
