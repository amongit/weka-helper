Chinese researchers have demonstrated a working quantum router that, for the first time, uses quantum control signals to route the quantum data, according to MIT's Technology Review blog.
Historically, routing quantum information has been very difficult because of the peculiar nature of the quantum world. A classical router uses control signals to work out where data needs to be sent. But in quantum mechanics, the act of reading the control signal also destroys it. This fact makes quantum signals proof against most eavesdropping attempts: great for secure communications, less so for getting the data to where you want it to go.
