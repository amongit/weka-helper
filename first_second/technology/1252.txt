Keeping track of personal accounts and screen-names on the Internet is difficult.
Did I use this handle from when I was in university or did I use the one that I adopted in my mid-20s? Wait, for this forum, was it the nickname I used when talking about techie topics or was it my fierce gamertag I want to intimidate folks with in multiplayer matches? Did this website utilize Facebook, Twitter, or Foursquare login, or did I register with my personal e-mail address and password? Aargh!
