With Facebook’s purchase of Oculus Rift yesterday they take a step closer into becoming the real-world version of The Circle (a novel by Dave Eggers). Similarly to the Circle’s mission (transparency for all), Facebook’s mission is to “make the world more open and connected.” They’re certainly living up to it with their acquisition of WhatsApp, Instagram, and their allusions as to what Oculus Rift can bring about.
However a recent feature businesses are impacted by would be the opposite of “open and connected.” In late 2013 Facebook released a feature that allowed users to rate any business that had a Facebook page and a physical address. That’s fine, it’s natural that Facebook would harness its user base to provide more data about businesses, but for the actual business getting rated, this feature causes more harm than good.
