Telenor announced this morning that it will merge its operations in Denmark with TeliaSonera's own business in the country.
The move will create a joint, 50-50 venture run by the two companies. The merged business will have approximately 3.5 million mobile subscribers, which amounts to about 40 per cent of the market in Denmark.
