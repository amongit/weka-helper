My alternative title to this piece was "What the heck has happened to Apple?". The reason for such a negative title is that sometimes I can't believe that the Apple of today resembles the original Apple at all. In the past couple of years, I've fought with Mac OS X updates and iOS updates that are only on a scale that could be described as "Windows-esque". And I'm not happy about it. I waited for a few weeks before updating to Yosemite. Why? Because of "special features" that seem to plague early adopters of any Microsoft update. Yes, I'm tainted. Yes, I'm jaded. But what I shouldn't be is surprised.
Will your Mac run OS X 10.10 Yosemite?
