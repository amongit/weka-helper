Singtel has reported a 11 percent climb in net profit and 3.8 percent increase in revenue for its third-quarter results, but EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) falls 2.8 percent on higher customer acquisition cost.
For the quarter ended December 31, the Singapore telco said its group net profit hit S$970 million (US$714.2 million) while revenue clocked at S$4.43 billion. It attributed the growth to its mobile customer base, higher equipment sales, and new revenue from acquisitions in digital life business.
