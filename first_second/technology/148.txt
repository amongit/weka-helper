Company perks like merchant discounts can be a great way to retain employees, but small companies don't get to offer their staff such perks because they're too tiny to strike up meaningful deals with merchants. Often, they don't have the HR capacity to manage these deals, either.
One startup in Silicon Valley thinks it's got the problem solved. AnyPerk has struck up deals with a broad range of merchants in the U.S., for US$5 per user per month, and says it can make these deals available to customers' employees--all managed on its site.
