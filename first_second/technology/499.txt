Enterprises in the Asia-Pacific are looking to cybersecurity to enable as well as gain better control of their business, and are planning to spend 26 percent of their IT spend on security over the next three years.
This average figure is up from the 17 percent they currently set aside for security, according to a study titled "8 steps to modernize security for the application economy" commissioned by CA Technologies, in which Singapore enterprises said likewise for 23 percent of their IT spend compared to the current 15 percent.
