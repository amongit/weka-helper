Robert X Cringely knows his stuff â€” or should I say, they know their stuff. For Cringely is a pseudonym used in the column Notes from the Field, which has appeared in InfoWorld magazine for what seems like aeons and is written by a string of reporters.
This was not always the case, though. For many years that column was written by one of the most famed IT reporters, Mark Stephens. While working at InfoWorld, Stephens made his name with the seminal IT book Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition and Still Can't Get a Date in 1992. Along with Charles H Ferguson's 1999 High Stakes, No Prisoners: A Winner's Guide to Greed Glory in the Internet Wars, it was one of the books that defined Silicon Valley's spectacular 1990-2005 boom years.
