When you spend a lot of time on the road, you need to balance useful travel technology that makes your life more convenient with not weighing your bag down with endless cables and connections you rarely use.
My travel bag always has USB power adapters for the charging socket in the car; I'm still using a high-power BlackBerry one with a USB cable and a second port that I plug a flat TYLT USB cable into because it doesn't tangle. And I usually take the Netgear Trek N300 travel router because it tames frustrating hotel wi-fi by giving your devices a known network to connect to (you connect your first device to the hotel network and the N300 learns the connection from there.
