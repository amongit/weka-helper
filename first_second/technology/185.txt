Do you remember a time before we used to talk about "mobile"?
In reality, it's only been a few years. You don't actually have to go back that far to find a world where mobile was unusual, where the only way normal people got the internet was through a PC that was physically wired into the network. First we got Wi-Fi, then we got cellular data, but mobile was always distinct, always secondary.
