As everyone is probably aware by now, going digital is all the rage. Whether it's interacting with everyone via social network platforms, or using cloud resources and web APIs, or going mobile, or all of the above, every enterprise worth its salt is pursuing -- or thinks it's pursuing -- some kind of "digital" strategy.
To some degree, IT departments have taken on a peripheral role in the march to digital. Many digital activities tend to be one-off projects, instigated within a shadow IT realm, or overseen by marketing types. Of course, IT gets called in later on to clean up the mess, be it security leakages, interfaces that don't deliver, or duplicated and wasteful technology investments.
