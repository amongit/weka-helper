With Project Spartan, Microsoft is building a new, modern browser for all Windows 10 devices: PCs, tablets and phones. Although the new rendering engine (Edge) has been forked from the one in Internet Explorer 11 (Trident), it has rapidly diverged from it, and now works well if websites treat it as Google Chrome. However, what may be more important is what Microsoft is leaving out, which is IE's historical baggage.
The Spartan codename presumably refers to the Xbox One game, Halo: Spartan Assault, which befits a new assault on the browser market. To those more familiar with ancient Greece than Draetheus V, it has stronger connotations of the city-state famous for the toughness and military prowess of its people. Even today, "Spartan" connotes "sternly disciplined and rigorously simple, frugal, or austere".
