Microsoft has announced two big changes in its leadership for the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, with a new focus on growth in underdeveloped markets and countries such as Iraq, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and Zambia.
The former general manager for South Africa Mteto Nyati has taken over a new role as GM for MEA Emerging Regions. Geographically, Nyati says, that encompasses all of Africa barring Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria — where Microsoft has an established local presence — and Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan in the Middle East. Reporting structures within the company are unchanged.
