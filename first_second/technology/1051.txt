New year, new legislation: for Finland, 2015 has started with a bang.
On 1 January, the 'Information Society Code' passed into law. The Code is a major new umbrella act revising the country's electronic communications legislation, which has four main goals: simplifying existing rules; improving consumer protection; boosting information security; and creating more equal telecoms markets.
