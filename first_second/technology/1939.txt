In January 2015, I read more about Steve Jobs and also the development of Bill Gates. I read an obituary about Charles Townes, the father of the laser (who died at age 99). I saw a fine film about Alan Turing, the mathematician who broke the Enigma Code during World War II.
In the month of January, I also attended the JR. Theater Festival in Atlanta, Georgia with 5,000 people from more than 100 schools in the U.S. - all participating, demonstrating, performing and taking instruction, workshops and extracts of musical theatre works with music, dancing, speaking lines, staging - using only their imagination, all dressed in tee shirts. Everyone observing had to use their imaginations and fill in the blanks without theatrical lights, sets, costumes, etc.
