With an annual mean temperature under 30 degrees Fahrenheit, the Node Pole area of Sweden, near the Arctic Circle, is becoming a hotbed of datacenter activity. Hydro66 is breaking ground on an 85,000 sq ft datacenter in the town of Boden, near Lule√•, which became a high profile location when Facebook invested $1 billion to build a datacenter there.
Taking advantage of the frigid temperature and the availability of low-cost hydroelectric power in the region, Hydro66 has broken ground on what they are calling their Ultra Green Arctic Data Center. With focus on supporting high-density computing, Hydro66 is also delivering the lowest possible carbon footprint throughout construction and operation, according to Paul Morrison, Business Development Director.
