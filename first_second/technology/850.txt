This is not going to be one of my usual 'Hands-On with Linux' posts. So if that is what you are looking for, bail out now! Fair warning...
I have had a sort of strange relationship with Linux Mint Debian Edition over the years. When it was first announced, I was really ecstatic. I was already a big fan of Linux Mint, and I had already fallen out of love with Ubuntu, so the prospect of getting a Mint distribution that didn't pass through Ubuntu along the way was appealing. Add to that the fact that it was initially announced as a "rolling distribution" (continuous updating), and I thought it was nothing short of great.
