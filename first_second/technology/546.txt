I do believe 2012 is going to be an exciting year for cloud computing, and there are many who share this belief, too.
Forrester’s US Tech Market Outlook for 2012, published in late December 2011, is optimistic about how much cloud computing will grow this year, estimating that sales for four leading vendors will increase by 23% in Q1, and will then grow 24% quarter-on-quarter until the year’s end. Although those figures are based on a small slice of the cloud computing industry as a whole, they show great confidence in cloud technology, especially in a year which is likely to see further economic turmoil.
