Because they're not originally manufactured with security in mind, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are especially vulnerable to potential attacks. If left unaddressed, the projected mass adoption of IoT can result in repercussions for the common folk.
IDC expects more than 28 billion IoT devices to be installed by 2020, while Gartner puts this figure at 4.9 billion in 2015, with 25 billion connected devices by 2020.
