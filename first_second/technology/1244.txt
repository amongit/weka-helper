In America, Google, eBay, Amazon, and the soon-to-be-resurrected Kozmo.com offer same-day delivery, often in under 90 minutes, of almost any product you could want.
It's the ultimate in convenience; sit at your desk, browse the shopping site, click a button to purchase, and the item shows up shortly at your door. Who needs to change out of their pajamas anymore?
