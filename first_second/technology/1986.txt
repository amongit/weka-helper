On Sunday, March 9, social media feeds were filled with people who felt like they were robbed an hour of their lives from Daylight Savings Time. Many people complained of loss: "I lost an hour," "The government stole an hour of my life," and so on. While there's nothing that can be done for past time, there are certainly things that we can do create more time: to be more productive.
By being more productive, you can actually gain time that is normally wasted in the day. By finding ways to be more efficient, you'll have more time and energy to do things that you really want to do.
