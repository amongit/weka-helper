Twitter may be heading back into Google search results, following a deal reportedly inked between the two companies to make tweets surface more easily online.
The 140-character bulletins, and often random thoughts of individuals, will show up on search results beginning first-half 2015, according to a Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources with knowledge of the deal. The agreement will give Google direct access to Twitter's firehose, so the former no longer needs to crawl the microblogging site to index the data stream from 284 million Twitter users. According to Twitter, some 500 million tweets are posted each day.
