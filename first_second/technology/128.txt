Of course you like working alone. You don't want to report to anyone, you don't want that 9 to 5 job, and you don't really want to limit yourself to doing something for someone else while you stop imagining for yourself and just follow instructions.
Usually, people get confused between being an entrepreneur and a freelancer. In both cases, they are independent and prefer working for themselves rather than working for others. However, sometimes they go solo and work on their own, and on many occasions they collaborate with others, hire resources, and get the job done. Come to think of it, there's sometimes a thin line between them, and to be able to accomplish whatever goals both entrepreneur and freelancer have, it takes a lot of independence and working on their own.
