If you asked people to name the two non-European countries in the world with the highest percentage of its population online, chances are that most of them wouldn't choose New Zealand and Qatar.
Nonetheless, a 2013 report from the Broadband Commission put these two countries eighth and tenth respectively on the global league table, behind countries such as Iceland (which topped the list), Norway (which came second) and Finland (seventh), but ahead of the UK (12th), the USA (24th), Japan (29th) and Singapore (33rd).
