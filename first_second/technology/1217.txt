Ever since analyst extraordinaire Anne Thomas proclaimed the "death" of service oriented architecture (at least the way it was perceived and practiced) in early 2009, I had wondered where SOA Software would take its brand as the concept moved behind the scenes. (Not that SOA ever went away -- the philosophy underpins everything enterprises do these days.)
The vendor stood firm all these years behind the SOA term, even as its own business evolved from SOA governance tools to a broader set of solutions supporting open APIs, cloud integration, API security and microservices. Now, the branding is finally dropping away as well, and the company has adopted a new moniker, "Akana."
