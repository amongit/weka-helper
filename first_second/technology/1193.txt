An international team of physicists led by US researcher Dmitri Basov, of the University of California, demonstrated that light can be caught and controlled within the two dimensional lattice of wonder-material graphene.
Theory has suggested that long wavelength – infrared – photons could be caught and moved through graphene at much less than the velocity of light. The photons were expected to be slowed down by their interactions with excited electrons in the graphene structure, producing a hybrid particle known as a plasmon.
