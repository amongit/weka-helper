As scientists battle to bend graphene to their will in the high-profile realm of electronic components, researchers working on more straightforward applications of this two-dimensional, atom-thin sheet of carbon are also making some interesting discoveries.
Results are counterintuitive because graphite — the form of carbon from which graphene originally derived — increases metallic corrosion when in contact with metals
