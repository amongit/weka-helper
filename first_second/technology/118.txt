An investment project proposed by Xiaomi H.K. Ltd, a Hong Kong subsidiary of Beijing-based Xiaomi Inc, to buy out Xiaomi Taiwan for NT$3.76 million (US$128,000), has been approved by the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the state-run Central News Agency reports.
This is the first time that a Chinese smartphone brand operator has been allowed to have a presence in Taiwan without going through a local company.
