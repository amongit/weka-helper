The Singapore government is planning to build a telecommunications network dedicated exclusively for use by the public sector and to support the country's smart nation rollouts.
In what sounds to be a massive project, the new infrastructure will provide integration and connectivity for thousands of sensors being rolled out--by various government agencies--to capture and collect data for various applications around urban mobility, sustainability, and improving sensing and situational awareness. These include surveillance cameras to capture errant litterbugs as well as the monitoring of floods via sensors installed in drains.
