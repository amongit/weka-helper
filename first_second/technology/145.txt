Calling all Southeast Asian startups, there's just a little over a month now to the close of IdeaSpace's 2014 startup competition.
IdeaSpace is a Filipino incubator and the largest privately-backed one in the country. Now into its second year, the startup competition will accept entries until January 15, 2014. Winners will receive about 1 million pesos (US$22,622) worth of support which includes cash, but the winnings also will cover other costs such as office space and training under a six-month program.
