SK Telecom has won its patent lawsuit against Viber after a South Korean court ruled the latter had infringed on four patents held by the country's largest mobile operator.
The Seoul Central District Court also said the mobile messaging app could not be distributed in the local market, according to a report by Yonhap News Agency.
