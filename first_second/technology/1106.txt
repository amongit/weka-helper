The Philippines has chosen Japan's integrated service digital broadcasting-terrestrial (ISDB-T) as the industry standard the country will use when it finally switches from analog to digital broadcasting.
The announcement is not exactly unexpected because the country was already poised to go digital since 2011, when the regulatory body National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) sought government approval to adopt the Japanese standard over DVB-T, a competing standard widely used in Europe.
