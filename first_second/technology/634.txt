SilverDraft's CEO, Amy Gile, and I had an interesting phone conversation about her company's extreme video processing and rendering technology company. Amy and her team looked into existing supercomputing systems and saw the potential for advancing the digital rendering process, but none of the designs fit their requirements. But what did fit their requirements will surprise you: supercomputing. Supercomputing offers the raw horsepower to do the work, but the systems aren't well balanced and are difficult to deploy and use. The answer, she said, seemed clear: The only way to get an effective and affordable supercomputer for digital rendering is to build it ourselves.
