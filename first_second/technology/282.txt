It could be a Twilight Zone episode. Or a brave new world, where Luddites have quickly become rulers of the universe. Or a gigantic editorial misprint. But the fact remains in that in a seemingly perverse twist to the explosive growth rate of smartphones in the world, flip phone shipments in Japan -- yes, remember those, like the mega-selling "Star Tac" or the "Razr", which we all thought were uber cool about a century ago? -- have outstripped those of smartphones.
Moreover, these are not small numbers. According to data from market researcher MM Research Institute, flip phone shipments grew by 5.7 percent to 10.58 million units, while smartphones fell 5.3 percent, to 27.7 million. It's a deliciously contrary sort of futuristic scenario that the likes of Isaac Asimov would have been happy about.
