Inside datacentres across the planet, various types of convergence are taking place. There's a convergence of technologies in the broadest sense, in that the three main technology areas are being virtualised: compute, networking and storage. This convergence should make switching disciplines easier, though whether it will remains to be seen.
There's also convergence in a more specific sense in that hardware is becoming commoditised â€” a generalisation of course but broadly true. For example, storage networks will eventually run on Ethernet, just like the rest of the datacentre.
