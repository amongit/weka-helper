I grew up playing on a computer back when it wasn't the norm. My dad was a computer hobbyist, so I played games using command lines and got introduced to the Internet and email back when they charged you by the minute. Yep, it was a long time ago.
However, like many young girls, I went through different phases and it wasn't till I got to high school that I decided to explore IT as a career path. It all started with a "Technology" elective class, which my dad had encouraged me to sign up for.
