If anyone still had doubts about whether Microsoft has moved from a "devices and services" company to a "productivity and platforms" one, those misgivings should be gone as of today, March 1.
As rumored, Microsoft has struck a deal with Samsung to preload several Microsoft applications and services on the the new Samsung Galaxy S6 Android phone. At least so far, this news looks to overshadow the new low-/mid-range Windows Phone devices expected to be unveiled by Microsoft and its mobile OEM partners at Mobile World Congress this week.
