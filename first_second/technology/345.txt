A revamped national broadband plan will be launched in the first half of 2015 with more government investment and the creation of "synergies" between the public and private sector to deliver improved Internet access services across the country.
The promise was made by the new Communications minister of president Dilma Rousseff's second term, Ricardo Berzoini. The minister told delegates at a public sector telecoms event that his team is currently working on a new plan to deliver quality broadband to the maximum amount of citizens at a lower cost and faster speeds.
