A bill which punishes online criminal activity with a jail sentence of seven years has been approved by senators in Nigeria.
The draft law, known as the Cybercrime Bill, had been debated and proposed in a variety of formats for a decade. At just 43 pages long, it's brief for its scope, as it seeks to create legal frameworks that bring Nigerian laws into line with international standards for prosecuting a variety of offences, from ATM card skimming and identity theft to possession of child pornography.
