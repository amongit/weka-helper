Customer service is still a concept many firms outsource. Better firms give it more than just lip service. Great firms make it part of every aspect of their firm.
Unfortunately, many businesses and the executives who run many of their processes don’t know how to make their part of the company customer service focused. They lack the tools to measure their efforts. They don’t know the metrics or the taxonomy for service measurements. Worse still, if they tried to discuss their progress with their peers in other parts of the organization, it might be a challenged conversation.
