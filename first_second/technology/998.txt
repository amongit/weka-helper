The deep integration of mobile devices into field work is aided by how easy they are to maintain in the field. Professionals who are in the wild for weeks at a time have the burden of keeping cameras, tablets, laptops, and phones running for days at a stretch.
How do they do it? I recently met a wildlife photographer working in the bush for extended periods. I asked him how he keeps his MacBook Air, cameras, phone, and iPad running without power outlets.
