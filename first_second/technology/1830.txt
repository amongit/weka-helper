Note: While recuperating from vocal cord surgery, I'm on restricted voice use. That of course doesn't actually apply to writer's "voice" but in this case I'm not writing that much either — and resting a lot.
But the business world never rests, nor do the active minds of my colleagues in the world of customer-facing thinking. One of the best thinkers and significant writers I know is Dr. John Tanner, a.k.a. Jeff Tanner, a professor of Marketing at Baylor University and a pioneer in CRM for more than a decade. He is not only the co-author of the all-time best-selling textbook on sales, but also was the first person to provide an MBA with a CRM specialty as a degree choice. He is also a wonderful friend who I am proud to know. Recently, Jeff came out with a new book, Analytics and Dynamic Customer Strategy: Big Profits from Big Data (Wiley, 2014) which provides a framework for a customer-facing strategy with big data — the first of its kind to my knowledge. I asked him to provide a small peak at what this strategy would look like since we are in a world where that particular take on strategy not only matters, but is becoming crucial to understand how to fully and continuously engage customers. He kindly did so.
