With its 4G LTE services already available in several Indian cities—such as Chandigargh, Mohali, Kolkata, Panchkula and Pune—Bharti Airtel now plans to launch 4G LTE voice services in Bangalore. In a formal announcement on its Twitter account, the company says the Bangalore service will be available within 3 weeks reports The Times of India.
The company has adopted Circuit Switched Fall Back (CSFB) technology to provide voice calls over its 4G network across India. What this means is that even using a 3G or 2G network, Bharti Airtel can still offer voice to its LTE subscribers using the CSFB technology. Successful trials of CSFB technology were conducted earlier this year in Bangalore, Kolkata, and Pune.
