Beleagured tech giant IBM has announced plans to invest more than $60m (ZAR 700m) in a new tech hub and startup accelerator in downtown Johannesburg, which will see the firm establishing its twelfth international research centre in the city.
The new facility will be the second of its kind in Africa - the first opened in Nairobi, Kenya in 2013 - and will be part of the University of the Witswatersrand's Tshimologong Precinct.
