Apple and Cisco have rolled out fixes for FREAK, the latest widespread bug that threatens encrypted communications. Cisco is also investigating whether the 'rowhammer' DRAM bug, which was detailed by Google this week, affects any of its products.
Along with the FREAK fix that Apple rolled out this week for its Watch-ready iOS update, Apple has now pushed out fixes for FREAK in Mac OS X and Apple TV devices across the globe.
