The Windows 10 Technical Preview has been out for some time now, which means that it won't be long until the Windows upgrade cycle kicks into high gear once again. But if my inbox is anything to go by, a lot of readers are still confused as to whether their existing hardware will allow them to make the leap to Windows 10.
I'm not surprised people are confused. There's a lot of well-meaning yet inaccurate information out there written by people who don't really understand what makes PCs tick. It's understandable because tech can be confusing, and the Windows 10 system requirements throw a few curve balls into the mix.
