A growing number of museums around the world are tightening their rules about the use of "selfie sticks" -- those extensible camera and smartphone holders used to photograph oneself from much farther away than is possible using an arm alone.
The concern of institutions such as the National Gallery of Australia and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art -- the latest to ban the selfie stick -- is not so much that visitors will take better photographs, but that they will become so lost in their photographic onanism that they will inadvertently whack other visitors. Or knock over a 2000-year-old Greek urn.
