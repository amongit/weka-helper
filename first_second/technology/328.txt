Altice has made an offer of just over â‚¬7bn to acquire the Portuguese assets owned by Brazilian operator Oi, confirming earlier speculation that a bid was in the offing - and also increasing the likelihood that last year's merger between Oi and Portugal Telecom would effectively be unwound.
The move by Altice continues the company's strategy of picking off cable and mobile network assets in markets it deems strategically interesting, and then pursuing further acquisitions within the same markets with a focus on convergence.
