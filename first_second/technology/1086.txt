Tor is the pop star of privacy-protection tools. It's listed in virtually every piece of advice on how to protect your privacy online because, as The Tor Project website puts it, Tor "prevents people from learning your location or browsing habits".
That claim has never been completely true, of course. Tor can certainly help conceal your internet activities by bouncing your traffic around the internet at random. But to escape spook-grade surveillance, you also need excellent operational security to avoid revealing your identity or location in some other way, and you need to keep your computer well defended. One mistake and you're gone.
