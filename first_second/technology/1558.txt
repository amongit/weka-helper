An Android developer has come up with a way to get Android Wear smartwatches to work with an iPhone. The developer, Mohammad Abu-Garbeyyeh, known as MohammadAG on XDA, has created an Android application package to run on a smartwatch - in the example the developer used a Moto 360 - to allow it to receive iOS notifications via the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) feature built into the iOS platform.Tablets: Where's the Productivity?The hottest device in the enterprise remains the tablet. Executives have pushed for them, IT departments have accommodated them, and users continue to clamor for them. Are they a fad or game-changer? We examine the productivity benefits, opportunities, and myths. Because this leverages existing Apple functions in the way they are intended to be used (although using a new platform) no jailbreaking is required. ANCS is a fully documented API available to any Bluetooth LE device, so there's little worry Apple will try to block this. ANCS is the service used by the Pebble smartwatch to enable it to display iOS notifications. This will undoubtedly pave the way for official iOS support for the Android Wear platform. See also:
