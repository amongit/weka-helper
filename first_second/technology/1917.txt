In our problem-plagued world, nothing stands out more than problem solving. Global warming, pollution, severe income disparity, structurally high unemployment, these are major problems demanding leadership to tackle them head-on before circumstances force a solution not willingly sought after. But in a world fraught with greed, self-interest, and favoritism, we many times find ourselves stuck in a situation where a lack of resources makes it difficult to overcome the obstacles that get in our way. The age-old proverb, "where there's a will, there's a way" never tires though because it remains a motivator in trying to find the best ideas that will help us overcome our problems. "All life is problem solving," according to one of the most esteemed philosophers of science of the 20th century, Karl Popper. Think of the problems you face in your own life. What gave you a greater degree of satisfaction than when you overcame them through creative problem solving? The same applies to the problems we face as a society and the need for the best ideas to finally come out on top. For example, at a recent PR stop in Cleveland, Vice President Joe Biden made the case that the United States needs to make 3.6 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2020 if the country is to overcome its 18th place in the world for the quality of its roads. With cities facing austere budgets, it's routine for them to fall behind in street resurfacing, especially when state funding is reduced. Is there a cheaper and more feasible way to ultimately replace our country's costly asphalt and concrete dominated transportation system?
