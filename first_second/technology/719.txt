NBN Co scaled back its fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) rollout projections for the National Broadband Network (NBN) twice, but was still confident that a predominantly FttP rollout could be completed on budget by the end of calendar 2021, a previously unreleased draft of the company's Corporate Plan 2013-16 has revealed.
The company's 2013-16 Corporate Plan was in draft status, given the impending election. A draft known as Version 12 — dated June 2013 — was published by Fairfax Media (PDF) in September 2013.
