The post-PC world is all about mobile technology, which means that people are increasingly concerned about keeping their various portable devices charged throughout the day. Most of the time, you'll be able to recharge your smartphone or tablet from a convenient source of mains power, but when you're properly off-grid, an alternative solution must be found. Many people carry a mains-rechargeable battery, and solar-powered chargers are also available. However, in areas where it's not feasible to use such devices, the Upp fuel cell is an interesting option. Developed by UK-based power technology specialist Intelligent Energy, the Upp was launched initially in Africa in November 2013, and is planned to be available worldwide in due course. In the UK, sales via the beupp.com store are expected to begin in June, where a fuel cell/fuel cartridge kit will cost £149 (inc. VAT).
The Upp is a PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell comprising two parts: the cartridge containing the hydrogen fuel, stored in high-density metal hydride form; and the fuel cell block containing stacked bipolar plates (combined anodes and cathodes) and fans to draw in air and expel the water vapour created by the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. The fuel cell block measures 119.5mm by 40mm by 48mm and weighs 235g, while the Upp cartridge is 29mm shorter at 90.5mm and 150g heavier at 385g. The two units snap together magnetically with a satisfying 'thunk' to form a device weighing 620g — something you'll definitely notice in your travel bag.
