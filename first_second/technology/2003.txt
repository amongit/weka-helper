Over the holidays, I committed the ultimate act of computer stupidity and let a hacker have remote access to my computer. I can only say it was a moment of "cranial chaos", which unleashed a cascade of unpleasant events. Our "to do" list gobbled up our 3 day family vacation in the mountains, and days later, my husband and I are still unraveling the unintended consequences of our fixes. I guess the point of this story is to make you glad you are not me. And to let you know how to avoid all of these trials.
Every bank account I had ever accessed, every credit card I had ever used, every site where I had ever purchased anything--all were at risk. So the first order of business was to lock down our personal and business bank accounts. Since we started on a Saturday and some banks had open customer service lines and some did not, we spent 3 days trying to get through a variety of phone trees in 3 banks to get to real people. This was compounded by sketchy cell service in the mountains and more than a few dropped calls. But by Monday we had frozen all our bank accounts and changed the passwords.
