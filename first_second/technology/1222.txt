It may go against the grain of everything we've been hearing the past 20 or 30 years, but the future of software is made for purpose, custom designed.
At least that's what at least 87 percent of 306 IT executives participating in recent survey seem to be saying. The survey, sponsored by Appian, defines custom software as "applications that must be built by either a company's internal IT team or through outsourced development because the required functionality cannot be purchased through a packaged software offering." Eighty-seven percent of IT leaders said that building their own software was essential to innovation, and 97 percent expressed confidence in using custom software, with 94 percent likely to recommend its use.
