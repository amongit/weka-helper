The Dutch parliament has approved legislation that will allow drones to be used for video surveillance of the country's citizens.
Almost all political parties voted in favour of an amendment to the snappily named municipal act relating to the extension of the authority of the mayor to deploy camera surveillance, which had been proposed by two MPs, Ivo Opstelten and Ronald Plasterk.
