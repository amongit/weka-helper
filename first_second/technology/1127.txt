A recent movie reminded me to pay tribute to the unassuming geeks and techies, but I realize I can only name a few Singaporean or Singapore-based ICT inventors. And I have met even fewer of them.
One of the rare gems is the kind Hui Weng Cheong, who is now better known internationally for his corporate resume. With his then-sidekick of sorts, the resourceful Jonathan Tang, and other techies, they invented various parts of the then-SingTel Teleview.
