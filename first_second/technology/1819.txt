As I made clear in last week's post, winning elite status ain't easy. It takes a company that not only had a strong impact in 2014 but is built for the future, too - which takes all the moving parts I've mentioned recently - great culture, excellent product, strong management team, powerful vision and mission, highly evolved ecosystem of partners and other allies, and excellent outreach along with the right positioning and messaging - all leading to a sustainable strong impact on their customers and their market in the future. Wow, is all I can say about that.
The three remaining Elites -- Salesforce, Microsoft, and PROS -- share those characteristics but are otherwise unlike one another. Salesforce and Microsoft have been perennials here -- their powerful impact in the market place undeniable. But PROS is a newcomer. Winning the Watchlist last year and becoming an Elite this year -- especially in a year that the number of Elites went down, not up -- tells me that this company is not only the real deal, but is built to continue to be just that.
