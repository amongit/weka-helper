I've been a T-Mobile USA customer since 2002; check out my 2002 review of the T-Mobile Sidekick I purchased to start my service, and enjoy the benefits of its Uncarrier initiatives. I am now on my first international trip since T-Mobile announced free international text and data.
If you travel overseas, you may want to give serious consideration to T-Mobile.
