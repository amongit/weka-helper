In order to win in a foreign market, a company sometimes has to be flexible enough to modify its business plan to suit local conditions, even if it means straying away from the very strategy that made it successful in the first place.
This is something that Chinese phone giant Xiaomi recently demonstrated when it announced that it will begin selling its next line of phones, the Redmi Note 4G, through retail outlets belonging to India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel. The telecom operator revealed that it would sell Xiaomi's 4G handsets in six cities through 133 stores.
