Microsoft's Power BI suite, a collection of Excel features and add-ins, as well as corresponding SharePoint and Windows 8 viewer clients, has been released to general availability (GA). In preview since last summer, when it was announced at Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference in Houston, Power BI represents Microsoft's first mobile BI offering, and its first cloud-based BI service, save for the now-deprecated Windows Azure SQL Reporting service.
Once upon a time, in 2010The Power BI story started when PowerPivot was released — in conjunction with SQL Server 2008 R2 — as an add-in for Excel 2010. Much of PowerPivot's functionality was subsequently built-in to Excel 2013, but the plot further thickened, with the release of a Power View (formerly "Crescent") add-in and preview releases of Power Query (formerly "Data Explorer") and Power Map (formerly "GeoFlow").
