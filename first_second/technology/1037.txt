Swedish prosecutors have asked for Julian Assange's consent to interview him in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy for the past three years.
If Assange gives his consent, the prosecutor will interview him at the embassy and take a DNA swab as part of the Swedish investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him.
