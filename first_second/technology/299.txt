"Our biggest accomplishment last year was probably advising on and helping to develop systems similar to our [secure data exchange layer] X-Road in Palestine and Namibia, and starting a similar project in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan too," the executive director of Estonia's e-Governance Academy, Dr Arvo Ott, said of his highlights of the year. He added that developing Armenia's population database also made the list of the organisation's biggest success stories of 2014.
The e-Governance Academy was established 12 years ago, a joint initiative by the Estonian government, the Open Society Institute, and the Bratislava Regional Support Centre of the United Nations Development Programme. As well as employing its own digital governance experts, it also makes use of a network of specialists from public sector bodies, academic and research institutions, private companies, and NGOs to train and advise leaders and stakeholders in using ICT to increase government efficiency, and improve democratic processes to help build open information societies.
