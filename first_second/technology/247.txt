Telecom Italia and Huawei have announced a three-year cooperation agreement to create a Business Innovation Centre (BIC) in Italy to develop new technologies and services.
Huawei will provide technical staff, skills, and international experience for the BIC while Telecom Italia will define which projects and services should be deployed, coordinate the various tasks, and use its own developers to customise the solutions created in the Foundry, tailoring them to its strategic goals.
