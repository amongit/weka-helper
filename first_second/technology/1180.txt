Graphene , the two-dimensional Wundermaterial that has taken science by storm, is starting to creep into almost-there technology . Nokia has filed a US patent application for a new kind of photo sensor based on the remarkable form of carbon.
The technology described in Nokia's patent application has the potential to make much smaller and lighter sensors than the current CCD or CMOS sensors used in most digital cameras, paving the way for much higher megapixel counts from ever smaller devices.
