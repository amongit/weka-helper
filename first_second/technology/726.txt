Force of repetition has turned Labor's failure to produce a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for its fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) National Broadband Network (NBN) strategy into a mantra for proponents of the Coalition's substantially revised plan.
"Labor should have conducted a CBA before it committed to FttP" is the gist of such comments â€” which have this week been followed by some sort of indictment of the previous government's haphazard planning, as well as a loud "thank you" to the current government for saving us from economic disaster.
