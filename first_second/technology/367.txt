Until very recently, Windows 8 tablets were a huge missed opportunity for the industry. Before Microsoft dropped the licence fee for Windows on small devices, the OEMs didn't come up with innovative designs to take advantage of what Windows 8 could do on small screens and ignored them in favour of the race to the bottom in Android tablets.
Those in turn are getting squeezed out of the market by phablets; the tablet market has been showing down as we all think about how many handy little gadgets we need to have around. It might be three or five or seven, depending on whether you think IDC or Gartner or Forrester makes the best guestimate here, but the devices are all increasingly the same.
