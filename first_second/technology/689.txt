Keystone NAP is building the future on the bones of the past. It's taking advantage of a power infrastructure that was originally built to meet the needs of a major steel mill and building a next-generation datacenter with more than 2,000 megawatts of onsite power available from four separate substations generating power from totally unrelated sources.
By building their new modular datacenter facility into what was once the steel plant's motor room building — which consisted of two blast furnaces, nine open hearth furnaces, two coke batteries, an 80-inch hot strip mill, rolling mills, a sheet and tin department, and a pipe mill — Keystone is taking advantage of the seriously solid and imposing structure that once exemplified a major US Steel facility. All that remains of a US Steel presence, that once employed more than 8,000 people, is a separate finishing facility.
