"Cloud-based services are failing to capture the popular imagination of UK businesses," according to KPMG. The company published its 8th annual Service Provider and Performance Satisfaction study today (Monday), revealing that "71 percent of UK organisations are spending a mere 10 percent, or less, of their IT budget on Cloud services". This compares with the global figures where 60 percent of organisations spend 10 percent or less.
Many British companies are "continuing to rely on 'tried and tested' outsourcing models and the survey shows that favoured destinations for IT support services remain India (51 percent), Poland (8 percent) and South Africa (8 percent)."
