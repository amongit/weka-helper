Last fall, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a bold (and to some, a rather cryptic) statement. He said he considered Microsoft's most valuable and strategic application programming interface (API) to be Office 365.
His reasoning? Making Office more extensible by third-party -- and Microsoft's own -- developers has a ricochet effect. Developers using the Office 365 APIs also were using Azure Active Directory and other related services.
