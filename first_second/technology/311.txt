When it comes to e-voting, Estonia has a relatively long history of getting citizens to cast their ballot over the internet.
Estonia started using e-voting (sometimes also called i-voting in the country) during the 2005 municipal elections. Since then, it's been an option for voters in six elections since: in the 2009 and 2013 municipal elections, the 2007 and 2011 parliamentary elections, and the 2009 elections for the European parliament.
