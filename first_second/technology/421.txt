Compuware has confirmed its plan to spin-off of enterprise collaboration company Covisint.
Covisint was initially established by car manufacturers including General Motors and Ford as a business-to-business marketplace but now targets broader enterprise collaboration including healthcare and oil and gas. Compuware said that after the spin-off it will no longer own any interest in Covisint.
