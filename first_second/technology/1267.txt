Point-of-sale (POS) powerhouse NCR isn't thrilled with upstart tablet vendors stealing its potential market share: hence its aggressive update to the Silver offering in December 2013 . An early customer, Happy Belly Curbside Kitchen, says what sets the NCR technology apart is its sophisticated reporting features.
"It has changed the way we operate: it's easier and faster to get the information we need, in the field, instead of having to go back into the office to add things up," said Happy Belly owner Joe Bruno. "Cash sales, credit card sales, taxes: I have more metrics than ever, which helps me better control waste and inventory."
