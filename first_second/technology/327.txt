Microsoft has signed a four-year deal with Real Madrid to undertake what it calls a "digital transformation" at the Spanish football giant.
The digital platform will have a heavy emphasis on data and analytics and will offer fans "exclusive, personalised and customised" content that can be accessed online, the software company said. This will be powered by Microsoft's Power BI for Office 365. Microsoft will also be supplying players and staff at Real Madrid with Surface Pro 3 tablets.
