Writing about IT failures can be a tricky game of chess because one must describe specific accountability as the facts demand. Sidestepping the noise to understand what really happened is not always easy. Fortunately, a strong group of practitioners, vendors, users, and consultants keeps the flame burning for careful and thorough analysis.
Among these advocates is Doug Hadden, who is Vice President of Products for Freebalance, which develops public sector accounting software. Doug writes an active blog, called Sustainable Public Financial Management, related to government and international IT issues. I respect his strong opinions on behalf of enterprise buyers and doing the right thing on IT projects.
