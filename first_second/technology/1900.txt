Kazakhstan can offer a much more visible contribution to international peace and prosperity. This country needs to be called upon to play a stronger and more active role in the mediation of interests between the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (E.U.), on one side, and Russia and the Middle East, on the other. Kazakhstan's recent mediation in the Ukraine crisis and Iranian nuclear talks should not be viewed as an exception, but rather as signs of the more significant role this country can play in the world arena.
It is in Kazakhstan's interest to reduce security threats in the region, advance economic interests and elevate its international profile in world affairs. It is striking that every time the U.S. and/or the E.U. look for a "compatible" interlocutor to mediate international affairs with the Middle East, Turkey is still invariably viewed as the only viable option. This, even after almost a quarter of a century since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the formation of five new independent states so strategically located in Central Asia (see map). And to mediate international affairs with Russia?! There are absolutely no options! From a geo-strategic standpoint this poorly diversified portfolio of strategic relationships poses several limitations to "the west" and to the world in general. Haven't we learned from the most basic financial management principles that a diversified portfolio of investments is highly recommended?
