Philippine mobile carrier Globe Telecom has admitted that a bill amounting to more 3 million pesos (approximately $68,000) given to a post-paid customer was in fact an "isolated error".
A blog post from Elmer de Guzman made the rounds of social media websites last week and generated a lot of interest, particularly among Filipino netizens, after de Guzman shared his story and shock upon receiving the bill from the mobile carrier.
