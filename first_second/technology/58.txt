Is there really any point in developing your own applications anymore? The growth in vertical solutions is phenomenal. For example, BCC Research is predicting that health care technology will more than double from about $11.2 billion in 2012 to $26.1 billion in 2017. The same trends are noticeable in other industries too.
Whether your business operates in energy, telecommunications, or the financial sector, there is a lot of good off-the-shelf software on the market, and software-as-a-service is booming. Furthermore, good engineers are not cheap, and lifecycle management takes a lot of time and effort. The truth is that many companies probably donâ€™t need to develop and maintain their own code.
