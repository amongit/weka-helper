Pretty soon — and in the not-too-distant future, most likely measured in years rather than decades — just about everything will be connected over networks. And by this, I mean literally just about every man-made object. With the ability to put low-power digital radios in just about anything that isn't sub-microscopic, the technology world is now preparing to usher in a world where all things have active sensors and can create a data stream that can be sensed, identified, and captured.
This uber connectedness will enable profound new business possibilities and capabilities, most of which will be beneficial and a few that will likely not be quite as good.
