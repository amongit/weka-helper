Cord-cutting continues to leap forward in 2015 with Dish Network's Sling TV partnering with premium movie channel EPIX to bring all the EPIX movie channels and video-on-demand (VOD) to Sling TV Internet customers.
Sling TV will now no longer be just challenging the cable and satellite networks by bringing sports, via ESPN, to TV over the Internet. With this move, Sling TV is serving notice on HBO, Showtime, and Netflix that it's coming after their cord-cutting movie customers as well.
