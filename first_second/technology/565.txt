Microsoft has bought the enterprise social network Yammer in a bid to boost the software giant's cloud portfolio.
The $1.2 billion (Â£769 million) cash deal was announced on Monday, confirming rumours of the imminent acquisition. Yammer will continue to run as a standalone service, both it and Microsoft said, but Microsoft will push its adoption as part of a range of cloud services that also include Office 365, SharePoint and Skype.
