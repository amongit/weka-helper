The city government of São Paulo is carrying out trials to improve the management of the local bus fleet of 15,000 vehicles by using data analytics.
Financed by the World Bank, the project is using technology supplied by Google-backed US startup Urban Engines, which provides both operators and officials of São Paulo's transport authority SPTrans with a comprehensive view of the buses and their ridership on a real-time basis.
