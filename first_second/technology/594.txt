Harley Earl was the initial designated head of Design at General Motors, later becoming vice president, the first top executive ever appointed in design of a major US corporation. He was a pivotal figure in the car industry from the mid 1920s until he retired in 1958. His importance in US business history cannot be overstated, with many parallels to the way Steve Jobs' leadership's blend of aesthetics, marketing, and technology blazed a trail of innovation.
