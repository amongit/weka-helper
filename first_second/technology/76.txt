Evaki founder Jignesh Nishar believes in a responsible lifestyle, and has a keen interest in solar technology (Evaki means "sun" in mythology). The company was founded in August 2012 to develop eco-friendly devices, and it launched its first product — Solar Power Pad SPP-01 — recently. The device uses solar energy to charge mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, and other consumer gadgets.
While the Evaki Solar Pad gives the advantage of portable chargers that are very popular these days, it eliminates the need for power supply to charge the device. The company believes that this device will be consumers' first step towards solar technology . The only drawback of the device is its size, roughly the size of an iPad — although there were fair considerations that led to the design choice. One, the device should be charged in few hours, so a wider solar panel was required. Also, since the device positions itself as the primary source, the internal battery was made to be capable enough so that the device can be used more than once in a day.
