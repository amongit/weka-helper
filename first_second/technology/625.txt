For a guy named Ken, and as a computer engineer, I'm taking this Barbie diss pretty hard. But, news is news, so here's how it played out. Some people felt that Barbie failed as a computer engineer and that the book, Barbie: I can be a Computer Engineer, was sexist and had other problems as well. A few headlines even brand her as "inept". I disagree. If you really look at the book, there's nothing wrong with the story. It's our mad interpretation of it that really bothers people. I think Mattel and the irate, militant feminists have <again> overreacted.
In the story, Barbie apparently comes up with design concepts for computer games. So, what's wrong with that, you ask? She tells Skipper that to turn it into a real game, she has to get Steven's and Brian's help.
