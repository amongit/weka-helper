Last week, my ZDNet buddy Adrian Kingsley-Hughes wrote an interesting article providing his perspective about why the desktop PC is far from dead.
For some reason, the idea that a guy with a British accent was saying "it's not dead, yet" amused me to no end, which got me thinking simultaneously about more Monty Python madness and other reasons the PC (as compared to post-PC) has staying power.
