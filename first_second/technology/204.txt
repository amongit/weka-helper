The Dutch data protection authority, College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens (CBP), has announced that it is launching an investigation into Facebook's forthcoming privacy policy.
CBP took the decision following Facebook's announcement last month that it will introduce new privacy terms of service for the social network, set to come into force from next year. The new terms allow Facebook to use details and photos from Facebook profiles for commercial purposes.
