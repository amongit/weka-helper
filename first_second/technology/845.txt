I had been thinking that a new PCLinuxOS release was due any time now, based on their quarterly release schedule. Sure enough, it has now arrived, just in time for Christmas - PCLinuxOS 2014.12.
The ISO images for the new release are available from their downloads page. The PCLinuxOS development team produces the KDE "Full" and "MiniMe" versions, and community members (and groups) contribute LXDE, MATE and FullMonty versions. All of these are available as either 32-bit or 64-bit ISO images, ranging in size from 563MB (MiniMe 32-bit) to 1.7GB (64-bit KDE Full) and all the way up to 4GB (64-bit FullMonty).
