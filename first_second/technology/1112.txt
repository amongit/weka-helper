The current IT issue raging here in the Philippines is about the Cybercrime Prevention Act, which took effect Sept. 27, 15 days after Pres. Benigno S. Aquino III signed and subsequently published it in the government's Official Gazette.
Some provisions of the law, particularly on online libel, have riled many sectors and a number of petitions questioning its constitutionality have been brought before the Philippine Supreme Court. At the time of this posting, four petitions have already been filed at the tribunal, with one more coming up today, and another next week.
