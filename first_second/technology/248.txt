Better late than never: while Italy's average broadband speed is still significantly slower than that of other European countries, ISPs are working to help the country catch up, rolling out a number of initiatives in some of the country's major cities.
One such initiative was launched in Bologna late last month when Metroweb began offering residents of three neighbourhoods in the centre of the city a 'fibre to the home' connection with download speeds of up to 300Mbps and 20Mbps for uploads.
