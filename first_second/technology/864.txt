Smartphone sales grew by 20 percent to 301 million units in the third quarter of 2014, with the boom being led by sales of low-cost Android phones from Chinese suppliers, according to Gartner research published today (Monday). China's Xiaomi was the big winner, quadrupling its unit sales. However, total mobile phone sales remained flat at 456 million units, as sales of feature phones fell by 25 percent.
Not all markets were equally successful. Gartner says that "emerging markets exhibited some of the highest growths ever recorded" with smartphone sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa growing almost 50 percent year-over-year. In the mature markets, US smartphone sales grew by 18.9 percent thanks to the success of Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but "Western Europe saw a decline of 5.2 percent, the third consecutive decline this year".
