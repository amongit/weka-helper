Only three years ago, Oracle wanted to do the cloud it own way, and ignore open-source cloud efforts in general and OpenStack in particular. After reflection, Larry Ellison thought better of that idea. By May 2014, Oracle announced OpenStack support for its Linux and the Xen hypervisor. On February 18, Oracle partner and DataBase as a Service (DBaaS) company Tesora is bringing the Oracle database management service (DBMS) and OpenStack together.
Tesora is doing this with a Trove guest agent for Oracle Database 12c. Trove is OpenStack's DBaaS program. Trove's goal is to enable database administrators (DBAs) to quickly and easily provision relational or non-relational databases while automating deployment, configuration, patching, backups, restores, and monitoring. In addition, Trove is designed to support a single-tenant database within a Nova (OpenStack's compute engine) instance.
