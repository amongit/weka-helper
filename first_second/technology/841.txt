It's the beginning of a new year, so I think it is a good time to venture outside of my "comfort zone" and try a completely new and different Linux distribution. In particular, one which is not a derivative of any of my usual selections (Debian/Fedora/openSuSE).
I have heard a lot of good things about Manjaro Linux, most importantly that it is one of the easiest Arch Linux derivatives to install, so I decided to give that a try.
