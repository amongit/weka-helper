I was catching up on my business reading this weekend and came across two great articles. One piece, while obstensibly about re-shoring, is actually a great HR lesson for business and HR leaders. The other is a tour-de-force about the substantial problems with performance reviews.
I want every HR person out there to read these two articles.
