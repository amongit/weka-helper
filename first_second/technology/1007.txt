This month, BetterWorks of Palo Alto, California, hired Jonathan Cheyer, former senior director of Engineering at Apple, to spearhead the mid-year release of an app for the Apple Watch.
The BetterWorks app for Apple Watch will provide a window into the firm's project-tracking and collaboration service for small business. This service allows managers of work teams to set milestones, or goals in BetterWorks terminology, and then track them at a glance.
