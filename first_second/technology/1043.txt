Last year, Microsoft spent billions of dollars on new datacenters around the globe, but a $250m facility scheduled to be built in Finland is yet to see the light of day.
In September 2013, Microsoft announced the plan for a new datacenter in the country as part of the deal to acquire Nokia's devices and services business. The $250m facility was to be "the home for a datacenter that will serve Microsoft consumers in Europe," Microsoft said, signalling the Finnish site would join the massive datacenters that Google and Facebook have already built in the Nordic region.
