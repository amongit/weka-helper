Lately, Xolo has been aggressively marketing its devices, especially on television, with promotional banners and ads appearing on primetime. Now, Xolo will be launching its first 4G smartphone with Bharti Airtel, according to reports from The Times of India. Xolo is the first Indian brand to offer a time-division duplex long-term evolution (TD-LTE) smartphone in India, as shipments will start by the end of the month.
Xolo has plans to launch a series of 4G devices at different price ranges, supporting TD-LTE technology, in 2014. Furthermore, Xolo also plans to ship more than half a million devices this quarter alone, as it predicts that sales for 4G devices will be competitive by 2015.
