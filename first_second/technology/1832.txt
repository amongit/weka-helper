In the next couple of weeks, I'm going to be providing you with three diverse and interesting guest posts - each about entirely separate ideas, each interesting in its own right, and each falling into an area of interest to me and, I hope, you, for one reason or another.
We start with this lessons learned piece by Richard White, CEO of UserVoice, the winners of the 2013 CRM Idol contest. Richard is a smart guy, an experienced entrepreneur and he has a company that was worthy of the title "winner" when it comes to CRM Idol. For those of you who don't know UserVoice, they are focused around customer service, but to call them just Helpdesk or Feedback is underestimating what they do and how they put it all together. They are a thoroughly contemporary customer service solution worth incorporating into your thinking when looking for something in that realm. For more details, here is the video they did that was among the assets that they used to win the title. Richard is an engaging man with good ideas who sees where engagement and the "entitled customer" as he calls it (rightfully) is going. Here's his thinking. What's your's on this?
