I've had my lovely new Raspberry Pi 2 for a few days now. It was shipped from the Swiss Pi-Shop less than a week after the announcement, so thanks once again to them for their prompt and courteous service. I've been trying it out since then, mostly comparing it to my original Models B and B+. The results have been interesting, generally what I expected, but with one or two surprises.
First the hardware. The form factor of the new Raspberry Pi 2 is identical to the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+, meaning that it will fit in the same case. It has four USB ports, wired network, HDMI, audio and composite video, and power connection. It also has the 40-pin GPIO header, camera interface, and a micro-SD click-in/out slot which I much prefer to the original SD friction-fit slot.
