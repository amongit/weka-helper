Aircel could become India's second telecom operator to offer 4G LTE services within 3 to 6 months, as it launches its network across established cities in India, reports The Times of India. Furthermore, Aircel could also be in a race against Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm to be the second carrier to launch 4G LTE services.
Aircel's established service areas are primarily in South India, as the company plans to offer 4G LTE services in cities such as Chennai, where it already has a 20 percent market share. In contrast, Bharti Airtel has focused within Northern and Eastern India, but hasn't had much success because of quality issues.
