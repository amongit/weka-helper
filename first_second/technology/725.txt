One of the most interesting things about the Coalition's long-awaited cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is how it differs from the previous NBN Strategic Review (NBNSR) on a number of rather significant points.
Foremost among those is the CBA's conclusion that continuing with Labor's fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) rollout, in the 'radically revised FTTP' form first described in the NBNSR, is now considered to represent a premium of just $10 billion over the government's preferred multi technology mix (MTM) model.
