It's no secret that Big Data, NoSQL and relational products are becoming increasingly inter-operable; that trend's been in motion for a while. But the game changer now is that products in each of these categories are assuming attributes of products in the others, in an effort to become one-stop shops, and not just part of customers' best-of-breed line-ups.
As examples, most Hadoop distributions now include some kind of interactive SQL layer and operational and data warehouse RDBMS products like IBM's DB2 and Teradata now accommodate semi-structured JSON (JavaScript object notation) data. And now, with the latest release of the Vertica MPP (massively parallel processing) data warehouse, the trend continues, in a very interesting way.
