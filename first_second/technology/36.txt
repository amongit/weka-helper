I'm all for better stability and improved performance in the Windows operating systems, but I've always been fascinated with the icons. Chances are you are too. I know that we aren't alone; otherwise there wouldn't be such a plethora of software out there that revolves around creating, viewing, and using icons. Don't believe me? Just Google Icon Software.
