This year's Tony Sale Award, presented by the Computer Conservation Society (CCS), has been shared by the restoration of two IBM 1401 business computers from the 1950s at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, and the Free University of Berlin's virtual reconstruction of a mechanical computer developed by Konrad Zuse during the Second World War.
The Computer History Museum's IBM 1401 project has taken a decade. It began with a computer shipped from Germany in 2004, but many of its germanium transistors and crystal diodes had corroded. The project, manned by retired IBM engineers, field service workers and programmers, started to look doomed.
