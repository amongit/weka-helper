Australia's favourite Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis QC, has called for cool heads in the debate on new national security laws. To help achieve that goal, he's divided the world into such cool-headed categories as the "usual suspects of the paranoid fantasist left" and "reputable conservative commentators".
When Brandis was asked why we spend so much money fighting terrorism, a rare event, and so little preventing domestic violence, a far more likely danger for individual Australians, he responded angrily, saying that was "foolishly conflating two completely unrelated issues".
