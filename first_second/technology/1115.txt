I don't know if you've noticed, but the advent of online publishing appears to have exacerbated the problem of plagiarism. I can still recall, albeit with amusement, an incident last year in which I saw an exclusive story of mine being passed off as having been written by another reporter.
I stumbled on the story because I was searching for the photo that accompanied the story, since I wasn't able to save it on my hard disk. Having done so, I was dumbfounded to find the exact photo--as well as my story--credited to another reporter working for an e-government-focused Web site.
