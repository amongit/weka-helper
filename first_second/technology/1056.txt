Imagine if according to NBN Co's own figures, the number of new brownfields premises passed each week fell from 4,532 per week between July 7, 2013, and March 31, 2014, to only 3,374 premises per week from April 2014 until December 31 of that year. Surely, it would be undoubted proof that under the guiding hand of Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, NBN Co has slowed down its broadband rollout.
The idea of Malcolm Turnbull sitting on NBN Co in order to slow down the broadband rollout is a popular online meme when discussing the NBN in Australia. The only problem with that idea, though, is that it is wrong.
