When we recently discussed the genesis of travel start-up Arribaa , co-founder Colette Grgic passionately spoke about "generosity", "gratitude" and "goodwill" as her key goals. Alongside the efforts of two other Australian female founders, she has demonstrated that true innovation occurs when you do what you love.
This flies in the face of the recent raft of uninspired, "me too" products and applications, where entrepreneurs have gambled their futures in the high-stakes game of Silicon Valley roulette. This game demands that a company rapidly acquire users (market share), which can be leveraged for a multimillion-dollar investment, or, ideally, a buy-out.
