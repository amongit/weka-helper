Adobe Systems launched Adobe Creative Cloud for India's small and midsized businesses (SMBs) in March this year. The membership-based service provides users with unlimited access to all Creative Suite desktop applications, plus other applications including Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe Muse, Adobe Edge, and Adobe Acrobat.
