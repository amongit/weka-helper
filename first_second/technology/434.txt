Life continues to be tough in the hardware market and Gartner's figures for the first quarter of 2014 offer little hope that it is going to get better anytime soon. However, there were some glimmers of hope for a couple of suppliers with Cisco seeing some signs of improvement.
Worldwide server revenues fell by 4.1 percent in the period January to March 2014 but server shipments grew by 1.4 percent. This suggests that in the market as a whole more servers are being sold but generally at a lower price which reflects the cut-throat competition in the market. Just look at Dell where you can now buy a decently spec’d Inspiron for less than £250.
