Researchers in California have designed and built a quantum processor capable of factoring 15 into its primes â€” with major implications for computer security.
Quantum computing is famous for its potential to obliterate current cryptographic techniques. Much of cryptography today relies on the lack of processing power in classical computers to factor a very large number into its primes. Each factorisation would have to be performed sequentially, and when you are dealing with a sufficiently large number, the calculation becomes all but impossible.
