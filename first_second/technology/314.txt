Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who chairs the steering board of the new European Cloud Partnership , is convinced that Europe should have its own clouds rather than rely on those from US service providers.
" Recent months have proven it again : it is very important for Europe to create its own data clouds, operating under EU law and completely safe for users. Right now, 95 percent of the cloud services used in Europe are provided by US companies. EU data protection legislation also needs to be modernised and we should understand that big private firms are able to gather more information than any state," Ilves said at a press conference held after a board meeting in Tallinn earlier this month.
