Industry group Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association Limited (AVCAL) said that venture-capital (VC) firms invested AU$122 million in 83 companies in financial year 2012 across 133 deals; a 9 percent increase in the people receiving money, but a 4 percent drop in the amount being distributed.
The report even cites startups that were founded by Australians, based in America, and raised money from US VC firms â€” even though this activity doesn't count toward the report.
