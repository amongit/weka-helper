When I came up with the idea for CXO-Talk and afterwards invited Vala to co-host, it was just a dream to have extended conversations with people like Sree Sreenivasan, Chief Digital Officer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is among the most important art institutions in the world. As a New Yorker, I can personally attest to the richness and importance of this museum as a cultural icon and resource. So, of course, I was thrilled and excited to invite Sreenivasan as a guest on CXO-Talk.
