The story of Africa's geekiest coworking space has become a well-established part of tech lore. Now the epicenter of the thriving high-tech entrepreneurial scene on Nairobi's Ngong Road, iHub began as an online community of developers and freelancers who would meet up from time to time over coffee. In 2010, with funding from open-source software company Ushahidi, they set up shop in a loft filled with the kind of industrial-chic details that wouldn't be out of place in parts of New York City.
Today Africa is dotted with over 100 such tech hubs, in everywhere from Botswana to Liberia. More are born every year, hungry for venture capital and support. In many countries, including Kenya, the entrepreneurial technology industry revolves around and depends upon such hubs in a way it never has in the West, giving rise to a tech scene that is more closely tied to the wealthier world, but with a distinctive character of its own.
