After a decade where NFC (Near Field Communications) has suffered from what Juniper Research called a "vicious cycle of indifference", the company expects this month's launch of Apple Pay to boost the technology in the US market.
In a white paper, Juniper says: "We would now argue that Apple Pay will not only drive, but will create a ‘halo effect’ towards contactless payment in general. We still believe that in most markets this will primarily be driven by contactless card transactions, but that the greater awareness of handset contactless payments that Apple will generate will, in turn, result in an uplift in adoption and usage."
