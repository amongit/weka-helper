Microsoft has inadvertently found itself in the middle of one of the largest corruption cases in Romania after authorities began an investigation into Windows licences destined for use in schools being sold on at inflated prices.
Romania's National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) has launched an enquiry into the reselling of the educational licences, and Microsoft is not suspected of involvement. "At this moment, Microsoft is not involved as a company in this investigation," a spokeswoman for DNA told ZDNet.
