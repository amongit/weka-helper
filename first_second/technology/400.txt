Network-attached storage is a pain. That's not because the hardware vendors aren't selling the stuff, or because it doesn't work. In fact, demand for storage has never been higher, so it clearly does work.
The problem comes when a company grows beyond the limits of a few NAS boxes and needs more storage. Lots more storage.
