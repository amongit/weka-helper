In India, the photography market is an unorganized one. In this competitive market, several photographers attempt individual Web and social media presences to showcase their portfolio and generate business leads. Much of the discovery and enquiry happens via word-of-mouth.
Piconect is a new service which intends to organize the photography market in India. It claims to provide business listings suited to showcase the work of photographers with not just portfolio, but also their equipment, testimonials, and reviews from past clients.
