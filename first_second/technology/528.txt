You might not have heard of Allview, E-Boda or Evolio, but they're Apple and Samsung's fiercest competitors in the Eastern European country of Romania. Here, local brands manage to sell twice as many devices as the tablet giants combined, and are now setting their sights on conquering new markets.
Worldwide, Apple's iPads lead global sales, accounting for around one third of the tablet market. In Romania, however, Apple had a humble four per cent share last year, while Samsung was in pole position with 15.6 percent, somewhat below its worldwide share, according to IDC Romania.
