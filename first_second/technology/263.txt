Opera Mediaworks, the Norwegian browser maker's US-based advertising subsidiary, has acquired South African mobile ad network AdVine.
The buyout gives Opera Mediaworks a partner which has been selling Opera's own mobile-ad inventory, as well as inventory it manages on behalf of third parties, such as mobile network operators, in Africa. It's an important market as many consumers on the continent access the internet directly through mobile, echewing the desktops so many in Europe and the US rely on and earning it the name 'mobile-first Africa'.
