Want to be a third-party developer on Facebook? Prepare to duke it out with plenty of others.
I spoke with Kiran Raghavan, Facebook's Asia-Pacific regional manager for its Preferred Marketing Developer (PMD) program. He said each month, Facebook receives about 60 to 70 applications from developers keen to join its Preferred Marketing Developer (PMD) program in Asia. From there, 10 percent are shortlisted to get to the next stage of screening. That stage involves face-to-face meetings with developers , where Facebook finds out what the applicants' business models are, how long they've been active, and what they're interested in with regard to Facebook.
