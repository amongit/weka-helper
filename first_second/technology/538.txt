Cloud computing is essentially about paying for what you need in terms of IT services and getting it when you want it. In principle start-up companies can get off the ground, and major organisations reorient their infrastructure, in days - as they donâ€™t need onerous capital investment for IT infrastructure.
It naturally follows that working practices are also going to change. We can already see this within IT departments where job roles are changing. For example, cloud specialist, cloud architect and cloud alliance manager are job functions that are becoming increasingly commonplace. Implicit within these new IT opportunities is usually the need to be able to work closely with the business.
