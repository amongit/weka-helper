IT workers in the Brazilian state of SÃ£o Paulo will get 7.8 percent salary increase and the right to a share of employer's profits as the main outcomes of this year's pay and benefit negotiations.
The increase in pay is way less than the union representing the state techies, Sindpd, was demanding: the original demands included a 10.5 percent rise increase in lunch allowances (which in Brazil are paid for by employers) to R$18 ($6.6) per day, plus larger contributions towards health insurance and profit sharing plans for all IT workers in the state.
