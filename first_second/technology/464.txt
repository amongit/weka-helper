The Apache Software Foundation announced this morning that Spark, the distributed, in-memory cluster computing framework that runs on Hadoop, has graduated from incubator status to top-level project.
It's seemed for a while now that 2014 would be Spark's year. Spark moves Hadoop beyond the disk-based, batch mode operation of MapReduce to full-on interactive, distributed in-memory processing colossus. According to the Spark Web site home page, the engine can "run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk."
