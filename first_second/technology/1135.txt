Last weekend, Evernote sent out an e-mail detailing how its operations and security team had discovered and blocked suspicious activities on its network. Apparently, the cloud services organization was the target of a "coordinated attempt to access security areas" pertaining to its popular Evernote Service.
The company admitted that the unidentified hackers were able to gain access to Evernote user information which includes usernames, e-mail addresses, and encrypted passwords. While there was no evidence content stored in Evernote was accessed, it was evident the hackers had that in mind given that they targeted the password file.
