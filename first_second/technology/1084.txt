DevOps is pretty much the work of the devil. Why on earth would you let developers -- people who tinker and fiddle and crash things as they struggle to get complex software to work properly -- anywhere near productions systems that need to maintain a bunch of nines of reliability? This fad must die.
At least, that was the core of my thinking, as someone influenced by old-school notions of reliable systems and network administration, until a recent conversation with Dr Nataraj (Raj) Nagaratnam, chief technology officer for IBM's Security Solutions division.
