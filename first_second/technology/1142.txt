In recent years we've heard plenty about the rise of mobile computing using smartphones, phablets, tablets and hybrid tablet/laptops, with accompanying noises about how the desktop PC is 'dead'. The workhorse desktop may have had its day, but it seems that there's life left in aspirational/high-end systems, as exemplified by Apple's just-announced 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K Display. More than an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, an Apple Watch or an iPad Air 2, this is the new Apple product I'm itching to get my hands on.
Costing from £1,999 (inc. VAT; £1,665.83 ex. VAT), the new 5K iMac won't be for everyone, of course. However, it's sure to be on the wish-lists of many a creative professional and well-heeled consumer. So what's all the fuss about? Let's have a look.
