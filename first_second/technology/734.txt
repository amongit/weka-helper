This year will see the last Australian consumers helped to switch from analogue to digital TV, but that won't stop the Department of Communications from spending $43.7 million on switchover-related initiatives over the next four years.
Funding for the Digital Television Switchover, as detailed in the Abbott government's maiden Budget handed down this week, will decline from $39.88m this year to just $10.91m next year, then stay at around the level for at least the next four years.
