Google unveiled on Tuesday Google Drive, its online storage system. Allowing users to store any sort of data in Google's cloud, access is through the browser or an app for Windows, Mac OS, Android and, "in the next few weeks", iOS.
Once installed, the app maps Google Drive into the local system as a disk drive, letting users drag and drop files as normal.
