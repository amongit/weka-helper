Apple's personal assistant Siri may be able to answer many questions, but until recently 'When will you speak Dutch?' wasn't one of them.
While Siri is currently available in many languages - Cantonese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Spanish among them - Apple has said that with the beta version of iOS 8.3, users in the Netherlands will be able to give Siri voice commands in their native language.
