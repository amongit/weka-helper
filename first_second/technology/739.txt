While the reaction is not surprising, it is wrong to place the blame on Australia dropping down broadband rankings in Akamai's latest quarterly State of the Internet report on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull's decision to change the National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout.
Late last week, Akamai's State of the Internet report for the third quarter of 2014 contained some grim news for Australia. We are sliding down the rankings in average connection speeds from 41st in Q2 to 44th in Q3, with average connection speeds down 1.8 percent quarter on quarter, to 6.9Mbps.
