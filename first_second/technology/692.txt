Designed with a focus on handling the massive amounts of data that needs to be processed by the oil and gas industries as part of their exploration for new sources, the Nimbix HPC cloud continues to grow by adding even more powerful Nvidia Tesla and GRID GPUs.
While the Nimbix JARVICE platform was designed for the traditional uses of HPC such as Seismic Processing and Reverse-Time-Migration that are stalwarts of the exploration industry, the processing power is appropriate for many other uses. Some applications — such as pharmaceutical modeling and image rendering — have become commonplace in the HPC world, but it is the advent of big data analytics that is making supercomputing mainstream.
