Most people are happy with inexpensive Chromebooks. Some people, and I'm one of them, want top-of-the-line hardware and were willing to pay $1,449 for the Chromebook Pixel back in 2013. Now, Google will soon be releasing a Chromebook Pixel 2.
Despite requests, Google has not confirmed this. Still, at Teamwork 2015, a conference for Google for Work system administrators and partners, Ren√©e Niemi, Google's Director of the Android and Chrome Global Business Unit within Enterprise, said, "We do have a new Pixel coming out and it will be coming out soon. We will be selling it but I just have to set your expectations: this is a development platform. This is really a proof of concept. We don't make very many of these -- we really don't. And [...] our developers and our Googlers consume 85% of what we produce. But yes, we do have a new Pixel coming out."
