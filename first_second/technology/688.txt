If you haven’t been following Steve Wozniak’s technical career (as opposed to watching him on Dancing with the Stars), his latest appearance on the technical scene might come as a surprise. Primary Data, a storage virtualization start-up that just came out of stealth mode, announced at the DEMO conference yesterday that Wozniak was on board as Chief Scientist.
The new business reunites David Flynn and Rick White, co-founders of the server flash card vendor Fusion-io in 2005 (which was sold to Sandisk earlier this year for $1.1 billion) with Wozniak, who joined Fusion-io in 2009 as Chief Scientist.
