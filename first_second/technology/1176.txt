An international group of scientists, headed up by researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, has created the first-ever working quantum bit based on a silicon atom.
The work, which was published on Friday in the journal Nature, outlines how the team managed to read and write information using the spin of an electron bound to a single phosphorus atom embedded in a silicon chip.
