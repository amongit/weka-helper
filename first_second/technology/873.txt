The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is working to develop open standards that will enable companies and individuals to make secure payments over the web. Today (Wednesday 15 October) it launched a Payments Interest Group, which it hopes will attract industry participants from banks and card providers, e-commerce companies, merchants, the suppliers of browsers and digital wallets, telecoms operators and other interested parties, including regulatory bodies.
The W3C says its payments platform will cover "international low-value remittances, general retail payments, bill payments, and utility payments. The group will study the current gaps in Web technology regarding usability, security, and privacy, and recommend new work to fill those gaps."
