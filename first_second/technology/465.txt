IBM announced this morning that it has agreed to acquire NoSQL vendor Cloudant. Cloudant, based in Boston, offers a cloud-hosted version of what is essentially the Apache CouchDB JSON document store. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Of the deal, expected to close in the first quarter of the year, Cloudant CTO and Co-Founder Adam Kocoloski said "Joining IBM allows Cloudant to innovate faster than ever before, and IBM's track record in open source software gives us complete confidence in our ongoing collaboration with the Apache CouchDB project. Cloudant could not have found a better home than IBM."
