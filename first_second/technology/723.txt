Depending on how closely you follow National Broadband Network (NBN) news, you may or may not have noticed NBN Co's media meltdown over the past week. Either way, it was a doozy â€” and it came about mainly because the company's own internal work demonstrated that it is in fact capable of rolling out fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) NBN connections faster and more cheaply than the current government wants to admit.
Faster, cheaper FttP, after all, would completely undermine the claimed cost benefit of adopting the Malcolm Turnbull Melange (MTM) alternative strategy, which has focused on replacing the construction of a modern and future-proof network with a dog's breakfast of technologies that has at its core the renationalisation of the same Telstra copper access network (CAN) that the government sold to the private market a decade ago.
