Microsoft has opened its fifth global Cybercrime Satellite Centre in Singapore to support its cybercrime efforts in Asia-Pacific, which is increasingly a hot target for hackers.
The facility is the third in the region where there are similar centers in Beijing and Tokyo, and will lend its services to Southeast Asian economies including India, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. The other two global sites are in Berlin and Washington, the latter of which was where the first was launched in November 2013.
