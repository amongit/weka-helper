I wrote about KaOS Linux some time ago, when the 2014.06 release came out. I had it installed on a couple of my laptops, and I have been using it occasionally since then. It is a rolling release distribution, so if you already have it installed, you don't need to get these new ISO images and install them, you just have to make sure that you are current with all the latest patches and updates.
If you don't have KaOS installed yet, or you want to make a fresh installation for whatever reason, you can get the new ISO image from their download page. On that page, in addition to the link to the ISO image you will find links to instructions on creating DVD and USB installation media. I like this better than having to go search for another document, search the forums or whatever. The ISO is a hybrid image, so my procedure was the same as always - just dd it to a stick - but having the detailed instructions handy is a good thing.
