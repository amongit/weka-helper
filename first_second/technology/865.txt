The ITU has formally approved the G.fast standard that will deliver broadband with speeds of up to 1Gbps over the existing copper wires between premises and fibre-equipped street cabinets. The new standard is a step up in speed and frequency from the VDSL2 systems currently used to deliver faster speeds - typically 40 or 80Mbps - than ADSL2.
G.fast's main advantage is that it's much cheaper to install than fibre to the premises (FTTP), and the ITU reckons customers will be able to install it themselves. The main disadvantages are that it's not as fast as FTTP, and that - as with ADSL and VDSL - speed falls off with distance.
