There was plenty of new and interesting stuff at the annual BETT education and training technology show, which closed yesterday (Saturday) at the Excel centre in London's docklands - far too much to cover in one post. However, it was a good place to spot trends, such as a growing interest in 3D printing, and to lay hands on products I hadn't seen before.
The educational technology market is obviously not the same as the consumer and business markets, though there are overlaps. Judging by what was on the stands, and chatting to exhibitors, Microsoft Windows 8.1 is finding favour in British schools, with 2-in-1 laptops being particularly popular for providing both laptop and tablet functionality. (This says nothing about what schools are actually using today.) There was also interest in Chromebooks, though these are growing from a very low base.
