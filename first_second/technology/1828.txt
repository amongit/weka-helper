Note: Eric Schneider is somewhat different than the other guest posters I've had. I met him through some intriguing tweets he sent me that referred to what he called a digital factory. After some further exploration, I realized that this would be worth putting out there to see what you guys think. While I haven't known him long, I do know that he has a long history in the CRM industry.
Over the years, he's spoken with hundreds of companies about their processes and has seen them go from automating repetitive tasks to leveraging data to engage customers. So the "digital factory" didn't come out of nowhere. I'm really curious about what you all think on this one. I like the idea.
