Since 2012 Logitech's business unit has released two well-received high-definition videoconferencing endpoints aimed at small businesses and enterprise departments: the £229.99 (inc. VAT) BCC950 ConferenceCam for small meeting rooms or around-PC huddles, and the £799.99 (inc. VAT) ConferenceCam CC3000e for large meeting rooms. Now, to bridge the gap between these products, the company has unveiled the £449 (inc. VAT) ConferenceCam Connect, which it describes as "a portable all-in-one solution with a breakthrough design for small and medium-sized rooms".
