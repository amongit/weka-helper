I once wrote a book entitled, How to Buy (& Survive) Your First Computer, which actually had a chapter called "Computer Disasters Are Not for You!". In other words, back in the computer dark ages I was something of a techie, a Systems Engineer with IBM. Of course in that bygone era of punched cards and tabulating machines, a computer disaster might have been a dropped box of cards. We couldn't do anything very exotic with these simple machines; the Internet and home computers were in no one's crystal ball, but neither was the worry of getting hacked. Computer disasters today are actually disastrous!
My son, who can text, surf and code with his eyes closed, has frequently scolded me about opening emails and clicking links. But the day after Christmas, I was lulled into a spirit of good will and unsuspiciousness when along came an email from a good friend. Watch this cute video of a cheerleader it said. "You won't believe what she can do!" I clicked. And with that one small movement I unleashed a torrent of terror (yes, terror). My very quiet computer erupted with sirens, honking horns, and a very stern woman's voice shouting that I had serious malware, viruses and malignancies on my computer! If I did not call the number flashing on my screen immediately, a disaster beyond my imagining would occur. And of course the computer was locked down and the screeching persisted. I called.
