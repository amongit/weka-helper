A/B testing is a methodology to test out two variants and experiment to find out which version works better with the audience. A lot has been happening in the Web space with A/B testing and it has now caught up on the mobile as well especially since there has been a surge in mobile application development.
While developing applications, most developers find iterations that are required within a shorter turnaround time very tricky. Especially since any change in the application has to be updated via the app store. So a lot of them find introducing new features a bit risky as there is hardly any way to statistically test how users will react to the new feature or changes. That's where this startup from India, Appiterate comes into the picture to address this.
