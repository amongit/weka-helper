Thousands of O2 mobile customers in the U.K. are without service this evening following an unidentified network outage.
Customers were informed on Twitter just after 4:30 p.m. BST that a "problem" is affecting some customers' mobile service --- including making calls and using data --- and that engineers were on the case.
