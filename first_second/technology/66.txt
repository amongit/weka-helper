When you have a cup of steaming hot coffee, you generally don’t chug it all down at once. Sipping not only avoids scalding your insides, but it also gives you time to do other things while you enjoy your coffee, such as driving or checking email, or driving and checking email (not recommended!).
Virtualizing small workloads is kind of like sipping coffee. Small workloads don’t use the full capacity of a single physical machine most of the time, so resource pooling can lead directly to higher utilization and lower overall costs. Small virtual workloads also tend to run well on commodity hardware which makes them a great match for cloud deployment.
