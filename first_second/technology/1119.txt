Hackathons are not new to the world or to Singapore. Interestingly, not many people in the Singapore corporate business world are even aware of what hackathons are, much less have attended or participated in one.
I realized that there has been a technology track for the business of news, such as OpenNews at the first news hackathon in Singapore, OpenNews.Hack Asia 2013. I decided that hackathons can be a fun way to keep up with technology.
