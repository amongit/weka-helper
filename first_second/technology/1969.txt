When I was in 7th grade, I fell in love with computer science. I was in a class on futuristic thinking and we came across the concept of Artificial Intelligence. I was hooked. That very same day, I went home, bought a coding book and decided that this was what I was going to focus on.
Then, when I was in 10th grade, my cousin was diagnosed with breast cancer and I saw firsthand the effect such a diagnosis can have on a woman and her family. Equipped with the knowledge that 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and that early detection is crucial, I knew I wanted to get involved and make a difference.
