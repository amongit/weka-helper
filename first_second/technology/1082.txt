Weighing in at more than 130 kilograms, or 290 pounds, Kim Dotcom makes an unlikely Christmas fairy. Nevertheless, he cast himself in that role on the weekend by buying off Lizard Squad, the guys who claimed to be running the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was crippling the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox networks on Christmas Day. Thanks to Dotcom, Christmas went from gameless awful to game-filled awesome. Hurrah!
Everybody wins here, right? Gamers get to play again. Lizard Squad gets 3000 free vouchers for Dotcom's encrypted cloud storage service, Mega. With a list price of $99 each, those vouchers are now being on-sold for $50, potentially netting Lizard Squad a tidy $150,000. And Dotcom gets to do the whole sparkly tinsel thing in the media, boosting his already outsized profile.
