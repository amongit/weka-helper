It is ironic that the company responsible for stopping Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi in its tracks in India was neither a local nor global smartphone competitor, but in fact a company that exited the phone manufacturing business many years ago.
Swedish company Ericsson alleges that Xiaomi has been violating eight of its patents related to to 3G, EDGE, AMR, and other technologies, and that its repeated communications to the Chinese company to pay royalties or to desist altogether went unheeded. Hence, it decided to lodge a suit in Delhi's High Court.
