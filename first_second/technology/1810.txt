New social network Tsu has experienced explosive growth since it came out of stealth mode in October 2014. On Thursday the site posted that it had reached the milestone of one million users.
This is an amazing achievement for a relatively unknown social network to reach in five weeks. Social networking behemoth Facebook took ten months to reach one million users on its platform. Tsuâ€™s global rank on Alexa, the measure of how popular the site is, has climbed from below 11,000 in October to 5,000 today.
