For those coming in late, HGST is the mashup of Hitachi's former disk business with IBM's former disk business. Western Digital bought HGST a couple of years ago, and is keeping the respected HGST brand alive.
Skyera was a late-entry into the all-flash array market that HGST bought last year. While it wasn't clear if Skyera had shipped a v1.0 product, the buy was surprising because, traditionally, drive vendors have not competed with their storage system customers.
