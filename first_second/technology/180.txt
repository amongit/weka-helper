I've been using Twitter "in anger" for about three years. I'm a huge fan of it. It's changed my life personally and professionally in unimaginable ways.
One struggle I have with Twitter is that if I talk to someone who doesn't use it and they ask me why they should, I end up stumped. I usually demure and say that it's rather like the Matrix â€” you have to see it for yourself.
