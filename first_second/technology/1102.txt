As I write this piece, tons of relief goods are still being shipped to areas battered by Typhoon Haiyan (locally called Yolanda) in central Philippines.
The typhoon, said to be the strongest ever recorded in modern history, ripped through a number of coastal provinces and left more than 5,000 people dead, as of the last count. Many of those who have been to the devastated areas described the desolation and damage as something akin to a place where an atomic bomb had just been dropped.
