Most broadband in the UK starts with a telephone cable, a twisted pair; two cables (copper encased in plastic) that are twisted into a pair of cables with one carrying a signal one way and the other carrying a signal the other way.
Now hereâ€™s the trick - the copper can carry more than one signal. If you modulate a signal you can vary it so that one cable can carry more than one signal - in fact, it and carry hundreds of signals.
