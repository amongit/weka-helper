We don’t usually associate government with industry-leading IT but the UK government’s G-Cloud is a potential exception. Today, the perception that it’s dangerous to place private data outside of a company’s firewall tends to override the fact that the technology and know-how already exists to protect information in the public cloud.
The recent resignation of Chris Chant, who leaves the role of G-Cloud Programme lead, has unearthed some potentially uncomfortable truths about this journey. And yes, the programme hasn’t had an entirely easy ride prior to this. A brief outage within days of launch encouraged the naysayers to cast aspersions over the project. But a realistic analysis of the experience to date suggests that whilst this wasn’t the ideal start, it isn’t a cause to throw in the towel. Service was still delivered through other channels, and the story since has focussed more on its successes.
