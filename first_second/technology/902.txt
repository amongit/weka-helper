Not much over a year ago, few people knew about containers, and fewer still knew about Docker. Since then, the idea of building server and applications out of container-based micro-servers, has exploded in popularity. Red Hat has been watching this and now with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Atomic Host (RHELAH) the company has its own operating system/container pairing to offer the business world.
RHELAB is a purpose-built container host for secure and reliable containerized applications across the open-hybrid cloud. It provides all of the components you'll need to easily package and run applications written for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and 7 as containers.
