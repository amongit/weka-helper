Although Microsoft's SharePoint has been around for 14 years, it isn't the best CMS product on the market. As a SharePoint Administrator myself, I can tell you firsthand that there has to be something better. My interview with M-Files convinced me that there indeed is something better.
While this post isn't a review, I do want to point out M-Files' compelling features to you as I saw them during the presentation. Often we use products because they are the "accepted standards" and we explore no further. That's unfortunate because in the case of M-Files, there's a better solution at hand that's economical, fast, efficient, and easier to manage than our accepted default choice. Take a closer look and you'll see why I'm excited about M-Files for content management.
