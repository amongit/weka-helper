"My vision is simple... In the future all commercial action will be in cyberspace. But the cyberworld will need a ground base on this physical world."
It was this belief, expressed by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, back in 1999, which shaped the vision for the creation of Dubai Internet City (DIC). Part of the wider move to transform Dubai into a knowledge economy, DIC was launched in October 2000, with Sheikh Mohammed observing at the time that "this is Dubai's future".
