HTC may have announced plans to relinquish its shares in U.S. high-end headphones maker, Beats Electronics, but analysts say the sale could help the Taiwan smartphone maker stay profitable in 2013.
HTC last week said it would sell its remaining 24.84 percent stake in Beats back to the headphones maker for US$265 million. According to its statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange dated September 27, Beats will buy back the remaining stake held in it by HTC. It will repay a US$150 million loan back to HTC in the transaction which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.
