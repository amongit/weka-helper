SMB cloud apps developer Zoho is looking upmarket with a new offering that combines its core CRM offering with more than a half-dozen other services that the company offers as separate services.
The new product, called CRM Plus, will be priced at $50 per user, per month, said Raju Vegesna, the company's primary product evangelist. "This is the first bundle, you will see a lot of these moving forward," he said.
