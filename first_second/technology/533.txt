With the crisis in Ukraine putting a constant strain on relations between the European Union and Russia, Poland has been busy upgrading its military infrastructure. Improvements to the country's cybersecurity capabilities are being taken seriously by the Polish government, a director of the country's National Security Bureau told ZDNet.
It's no coincidence that one of the main themes of this month's NATO summit was cybersecurity. As is the case with traditional military assaults, it's chiefly the newer NATO member states, especially Poland and the Baltic countries, that are the most likely to become a front in any future cyberwar. Estonia, for example, experienced attacks on its public institutions way back in 2007, with Russian intelligence services considered the prime suspect.
