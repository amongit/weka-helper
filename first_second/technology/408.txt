It looks like the market to rewire your datacentre by virtualising I/O is hotting up.
In March, I wrote about Xsigo, and how it is bidding to centralise the arrays of cabling that infest server racks. Instead, you install an Infiniband card in the server and connect it to a box at the top of the rack. Inside Xsigo's Fabric Director box is where the I/O cards - storage and networking - now reside and, to the server, they appear local.
