All over the world start-up technology companies are toiling away waiting to be recognized and utilized. I sat down with Abhiroop Basu, content strategist at Zopim, which has gotten over early stage hurdles to reach success, and talked about what the challenges a young technology company faces specifically in Southeast Asia.
A little background about Zopim – they are a company focused on helping SMB’s grow customer satisfaction and loyalty through live chat software that makes it easy for a customer to connect with the business. They are headquartered in Singapore and were one of the recipients of the MDA iJAM grant helping them start up.
