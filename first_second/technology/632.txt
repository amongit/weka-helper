Congratulations are in order for the fine folks at SUSE LLC. Today in Nuremburg, Germany SUSE announces the availability of SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (SLES 12). SLES 12 is a much-anticipated release due to several improvements. I had the pleasure of speaking with SUSE's George Shi, Product Marketing Manager and Kerry Kim, Director of Strategic Marketing about the release and some of the new features.
We began by talking about the general available release of SLES 12 and the announcement, including the new features and extensions. One in particular struck my fancy: Geo-clustering. Immediately upon hearing the term, you know what it means. It means clustering over distances via WANs or the Internet. I love the idea for its disaster recovery (DR) implications. Using SLES' geo-clustering, you can have automated or manual workloads restarting in another area of the city, country, or world.
