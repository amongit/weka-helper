Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) Chairman and CEO Morris Chang said he was optimistic about the company's future, predicting that sales in 2014 would grow at a double-digit annual rate following its upcoming launch production of the 20-nanometer (nm) processor.
Chips in this category would account for 10 percent of the company's total sales next year, Chang said during an investor conference held Thursday in Taipei. To boost production capacity, he said TSMC's capital expenditure in 2014 would exceed US$10.6 billion, up from an estimated US$9.7 billion this year, reported state-run Central News Agency.
