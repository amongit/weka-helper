Today, Monday 10 November, Mozilla is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Firefox browser with an anniversary release and a series of launches related to protecting users' privacy. These include a new Forget button, the option to use the DuckDuckGo search engine, experimental tracking protection, and the Polaris privacy initiative. The idea behind Polaris — launched with the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) and the Tor Project, among others — is "to bring together thought leaders in privacy," according to Gavin Sharp, senior engineering manager at Mozilla.
Mozilla also unveiled a developer edition of Firefox, customized for Web developers, and a developer preview of Firefox OS 2.0 for the Flame reference device.
