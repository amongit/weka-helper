Twitter came out earlier this week with a new version of its two-factor authentication system. Usually when I hear about such systems, I wonder whether they're going to use the time-based one-time password algorithm (TOMP).
TOMP is implemented by a couple of companies; among them, Amazon, Dropbox, Linode, Evernote, and Microsoft. The beauty of using the algorithm is that all of your tokens can be placed in the one application.
