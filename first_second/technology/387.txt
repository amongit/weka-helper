Even though Microsoft is bringing a Start menu back to Windows with Windows 10, Stardock Corp. is still planning on offering users an alternative.
Stardock, the company that built a Start menu replacement for Windows 8 known as Start8 , has made available a free beta version of its coming Start10 menu app. The Start10 beta is available now for Object Desktop subscribers, according to Stardock's site, and requires the Windows 10 January Technical Preview to work.
