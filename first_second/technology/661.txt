From their announcement here at Dreamforce 2014 of their new Wave analytics cloud to August's unveiling of the Community Cloud , it's clear that Salesforce has developed -- and has been delivering on -- a comprehensive and integrated vision for how customers will engage digitally with businesses. Also core to their products is the capability for businesses to reach customers in all channels and to make strategic sense of all this engagement, and to do it very quickly, on today's new client touchpoints (read: phones, tablets, and even wearables.)
The new customer success platform mantra playing out this week at the high-profile Dreamforce 2014 confab at San Francisco's famed Moscone Center is indeed a clear one: Eliminate needless silos -- and other usability or service delivery barriers -- within the new digital customer journey , and create apps and new user experiences on-the-fly to meet emergent business needs in the moment. In short, the overall vision for the Salesforce cloud is that the data, applications, and user experiences required to engage with and deliver vaue for customers should be fully cohesive and naturally connected together into a consistent and productive flow. As a concept, it's the art of the possible today.
