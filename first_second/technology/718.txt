There's something very deer-in-the-headlights about watching senior NBN Co executives front up to a Senate committee to explain their progress — and I use that word in its loosest meaning — in converting the National Broadband Network (NBN) from something ambitious yet imperfect into a leap of faith that should more appropriately be called imaginary and imprecise.
One almost felt a pang of sympathy for the three visibly uncomfortable NBN Co executives who fronted up to the usual grilling — about the plan they have been charged with executing against logic, common sense, and commercial reality — with the usual cadre of difficult concessions, incomplete answers, and deferrals to put questions on notice. Grab some popcorn, and watch the session for yourself.
