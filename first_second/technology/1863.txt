As documented in DRAM error rates: Nightmare on DIMM street, DRAM error rates are hundreds to thousands of times higher than thought -- a mean of 3,751 correctable errors per DIMM per year. Which assumes your DIMM has error correcting code (ECC) to correct those errors. If not:
In Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors, researchers Yoongu Kim, Ross Daly, Jeremie Kim, Chris Fallin, Ji Hye Lee, Donghyuk Lee, Konrad Lai Onur Mutlu - all of CMU - and Chris Wilkerson of Intel Labs, found that commodity DRAM chips are vulnerable to disturbance errors. Moore's Law has reduced cell sizes and made them more susceptible to adjacent current flows.
