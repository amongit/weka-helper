Feel like watching the latest season of Game of Thrones? The new Resident Evil movie perhaps? You could sign up for Netflix or HBO, or just go out and buy the Blu-ray. Or, until recently, you could have moved to the Netherlands, where the word illegal is not in the dictionary — at least, not where it concerns downloading content — and where the government traditionally didn't care whether your steer your ship towards the Pirate Bay.
That all changed yesterday. Effective immediately, the Dutch government has placed a ban on downloading copyright-infringing material, following a ruling from the European Court of Justice.
