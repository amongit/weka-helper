Microsoft's Surface tablet may arrive in the hands of European customers with only one-year warranty, according to the software giant, despite European law dictating that electronic devices and hardware must come with at least a two-year warranty.
On Microsoft's Surface U.K. product pages, the software giant turned tablet maker clearly states the device will come with a "1-year hardware warranty." It adds: "Surface comes with a guaranteed one-year limited warranty. If you'd like additional protection of your Surface, you can purchase an extended support plan (Microsoft Complete for Surface)."
