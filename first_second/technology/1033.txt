With over a billion users, Facebook isn't hurting for potential customers, but a few months ago Facebook started to explore the idea of Facebook at Work. It's exactly what it sounds like: A version of Facebook for your office. The question is: After banning Facebook from your office network, would you use Facebook for Work in your office?
On January 14, Facebook took its first big step in turning this into a product from an in-house idea. The company is releasing Facebook at Work beta apps for iOS and on Android via the Google Play Store. But, even if you think this is the best idea since sliced bread, don't rush out to get the apps. They will only be available for a select few beta testers.
