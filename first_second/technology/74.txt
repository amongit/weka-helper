At some point in every IT manager’s career, someone somewhere above them in the organization is going to make a cloud decision based on a misconception. And these managers are going to blow it (and probably millions of dollars)—big time.
My advice for anyone who ends up in that position? Heed the learning experience because it will happen to you again. Meantime, it may be possible to head off some awkward moments by understanding some of the issues. For example, look at public vs. private clouds.
