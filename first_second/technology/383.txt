Microsoft is continuing to consolidate its mobile-handset manufacturing factories, according to a new MarketWatch report.
"Microsoft to cut 9,000 jobs in China," read the headline on the February 25 MarketWatch report about the coming closure of two factories formerly run by Nokia. That report -- citing other local stories -- claimed 9,000 jobs in total would be eliminated as a result of the Chinese handset-manufacturing closure and consolidation.
