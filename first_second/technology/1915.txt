I mentioned to a reporter the other day that I suspect the so-called "Climate Deniers" are not so much denying the science of climate change, but rather they are rejecting the message we've framed for them. Think about it -- when someone tells you "the sky is falling," your first reaction is denial. It's just human nature. We hear a bad health diagnosis, our first response is denial and we go get a second opinion. We rear end the car in front of us -- our automatic response -- "I didn't do it!" Denial is in our DNA.
