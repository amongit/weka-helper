The idea was simple: let's pretend our offices have burned to the ground, and operate ZDNet UK from out of town. Too simple? We thought so, so we complicated it a bit by picking a venue that would be worth visiting anyway, The National Museum Of Computing at Bletchley Park. They gulped and nervously shuffled their feet, but agreed — and so, on a grey April morning, we gave London a miss and went to Bedford.
The preparation stage was straightforward and didn't take long. Having decided on a venue, talked them into it and agreed with them what we were going to do, the next stage was basic logistics — travel, equipment and a plan of action.
