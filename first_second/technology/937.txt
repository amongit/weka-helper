The successor to Intel's low-power Atom-based Centerton processor will be named Avoton.
The codename will be revealed publicly on Wednesday, said Jason Waxman, head of cloud infrastructure for Intel. The chip will go into production at some point next year and will be made to Intel's tri-gate 22nm process, rather than the 32nm of its Centerton predecessor.
