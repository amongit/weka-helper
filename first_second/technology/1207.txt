As a person who loves the technical specifics of how criminals invade networks, exploit vulnerabilities, and do all the bad stuff that vendors love to scare you with, I'm often dismayed by what we hear from the government. I'm sure it's the case with most government initiatives — don't drown people in the specifics — but after looking through the update to Australia's National Digital Economy Strategy for how we're going to secure ourselves, I'm left wondering, is that it? And didn't we already have something like this previously?
The strategy is meant to be a blueprint for how Australians are going to use the National Broadband Network (NBN) and take advantage of the digital economy to prosper. It's probably a good idea to look into the online space, considering we're building this big network for it and the rocks are going to run out, but I get the feeling we're still this young, naive country that might have a good deal of intelligence, but no street smarts.
