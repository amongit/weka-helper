No standards have been published yet, no network architecture has been decided on, and there are spectrum issues. But operators and kit vendors are convinced that 5G, which should begin rolling out by 2020, is needed to meet the requirements of the much-hyped Internet of Things and connected objects.
According to the mobile industry's current thinking, 5G should provide the illusion of limitless mobile capacity - the ability to share data anywhere and between any devices. The European Union's METIS project predicts that 5G networks will be "at least 10 times faster, accessible in all conditions, efficient in handling very large number of devices, highly reliable, and providing high levels of super real-time experience."
