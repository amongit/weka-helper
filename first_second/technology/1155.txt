Video conferencing is an increasingly mainstream business activity, no longer restricted to high-level executive meetings in vastly expensive telepresence suites. The trouble is, according to Logitech, that most meeting rooms are ill-equipped to handle video, usually just providing a speakerphone and relying on users to bring their own webcam-equipped laptops if pictures are required.
Back in 2012, Logitech's business unit launched the BCC950 ConferenceCam to deliver ad-hoc HD video conferencing for small groups; now it has moved up a notch with the Â£699 ($999) ConferenceCam CC3000e, which is designed to serve meeting rooms holding up to 10 people.
