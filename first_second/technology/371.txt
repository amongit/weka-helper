Never mind all that guerrilla cloud purchasing in the marketing department and shadow IT cloud storage coming from all the office workers: more and more, the people pushing businesses to adopt cloud services faster than the IT department would do on its own are CEOs, according to NetSuite CEO Zack Nelson.
Business attitudes to cloud have definitely shifted, Nelson's finding when he talks to customers. "Seven years ago the mind-set was 'cloud never' - we'll never use cloud for anything. Five years ago it was 'cloud maybe'. Now by and large, the decisions is 'cloud first' because everyone understands [things have changed]. Five years from now, are you really going to be buying software to run on premises? No one believes that."
