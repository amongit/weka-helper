Android 5.0 Lollipop is now running on three percent of all devices accessing the Google Play store, with a further 41 percent running KitKat.
Lollipop, which was first offered as an over-the-air (OTA) update to devices in November 2014, is slowly but surely gaining ground. Its predecessor, Android 4.4 KitKat which itself first debuted October 2013 on the Nexus 5 handset, now runs on two out of every five Android devices.
