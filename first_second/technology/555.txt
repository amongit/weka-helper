Many people have become fixated with issues of security in the cloud. For some it seems to be the first and last thing they think of when exploring the concept. But technological advancements, including those I discussed in my previous post about secure compute pools, are making the security question a less daunting one. Where factors are more out of the hands of the business are jurisdictional constraints about how data is stored.
A recent blog in the Back Office section of this site discussed the risks that you face if data is held in the US, where the Patriot Act allows gives law enforcement great freedom to ‘explore’ your data. In the example given, the FBI swooped on a data centre to seize data from a single account. The agents were unable to identify the relevant server and so took complete racks in the course of their investigation. As a result, quite a few business websites simply disappeared – and their data too. The message here is that your data, even if your business is carried out in Indonesia for example, is subject to these jurisdictions.
