Valerie Ding's interest in quantum physics was sparked several years ago, when she shadowed a professor at Portland State University. He specialized in quantum computing, and showed her his lesson plan and textbooks, which gave her an early fundamental interest in the field. She started checking out books at the library on the weekends and researching the subject, and decided to pursue it in her research.
