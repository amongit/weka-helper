Google has released an iOS version of its Chrome browser, after taking the Android version out of beta earlier this week.
In a blog post on Thursday, Chrome chief Sundar Pichai said the move would give users "a consistent, personalised web experience across all devices". The new version works on the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch, as long as the device is running iOS 4.3 or higher.
