The way we perceive the world is changing, at least in how we deal with information. According to a December 2014 Deloitte survey, nearly 90 percent of us check our phone in the first hour of being awake, and 23 percent of us look at our phone up to 50 times a day. Information is bombarding us at a pace that would've overwhelmed our grandparents and even our parents. Thanks to mobile devices, computers, signage everywhere, advertising in countless forms, in-car displays, wearables, consumer appliances and now the fast-expanding Internet of Things, we've got many screens demanding our attention. There's no question that screens are becoming more pervasive, connecting you -- at a glance -- to the things you care about. So, how can we be sure that information is consumed accurately and effectively even in the briefest of glances? It's one of the biggest challenges for the creators and engineers behind all that information, like graphic and interactive designers, system engineers, developers and device manufacturers.
