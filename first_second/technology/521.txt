It all started because they were fans of Iron Man. In a modest workshop, spending their own savings and keeping their regular nine-to-five jobs, three Romanian guys got to become the incarnation of their superhero. They started a company called Axosuits which aims to build affordable exoskeletons to help people with movement problems. It is fast building up a reputation.
Their story is not at all unique. The road for homegrown Romanian startups was paved by local businesses bought by giants like Facebook or Twitter. Building a fledgling company is rapidly becoming a desirable career path in this country where around 90 percent of the IT industry is outsourcing.
