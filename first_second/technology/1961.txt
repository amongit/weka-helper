Data is the fundamental basis for our lives today. Future generations will able to look back at all our data -- via sources like Twitter, Facebook -- and paint an accurate picture us. And yet, the vast majority of us simply don't understand how data works. According to David Weinberger in his article "Digital Meta-Literacy" on KMorld, "we need to be especially wary of believing something because the people we hang out with on the Net believe it. Falling prey to confirmation bias, as it is known, is especially easy online because our social apps work by putting us together with people who share most of our opinions."
Even fewer have an understanding of one of the most fundamental units of data we have today: Metadata. Metadata directly controls lives, from property taxes to drivers' licenses to employment records to even web pages. And yet almost none of our pupils know about it; however, even a rudimentary understanding of metadata would allow students to garner a critical understanding of how modern societies drive electronic data.
