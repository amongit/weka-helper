Every April, we at Girls Teaching Girls To Code hold a day-long event called Code Camp to introduce 200+ high school girls in the San Francisco Bay Area to computer science. Throughout the day, 40 women in computer science from Stanford University expose students to their first programming language, help them use their new skills on cool projects, and inspire girls to the wide array of careers in computer science.
This past year, one of the concepts we wanted to teach was sorting. Sorting is widely studied in computer science because it's used everywhere, from putting your Facebook timeline in chronological order to reordering your Amazon search results by price. Quickly sorting a long list of items is difficult, so a lot of research has been done on sorting a list efficiently.
