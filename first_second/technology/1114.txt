Over the last few years, I've lost count of the number of stories that Iâ€™ve written about the proposed Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). If I recall it right, it's been over a decade since the first bill proposing for its establishment was filed in Congress.
Finally, a breakthrough came when Congress surprisingly passed the DICT bill early this year. It was able to do this despite simultaneously holding the highly-publicized impeachment trial of former Supreme Court chief justice Renato Corona.
