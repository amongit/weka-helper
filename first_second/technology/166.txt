Dimension Data is adding to its private cloud infrastructure services with a new offering that builds on the Microsoft Cloud Platform. The service builds on Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V, System Center 2012 R2 and Windows Azure Pack.
Even though the $6 billion integrator already has its own private cloud service, called Private Compute-as-a-Service (CaaS), the new offering is meant for businesses and organizations that are seeking to move Microsoft workloads between on-premise, Microsoft Azure and Dimension Data cloud environments. Microsoft is a Microsoft Certified Gold Partner and a Microsoft Cloud OS Network partner.
