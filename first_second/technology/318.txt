The Internet of Things (IoT) has been the true star of this year's MWC show in Barcelona. How can enterprises take advantage of the connected life, what changes will intelligent sensing bring, where and when will de facto standards and methodologies emerge, and which apps and IoT developments are set for success are some of the questions that have pervaded a bunch of sessions at the show. The IoT is beginning to shake off its 'emerging tech' label, yet there are significant challenges ahead. Is the future really IoT-centric?
For Alicia As√≠n, CEO and co-Founder at Libelium, a company that makes an open source IoT sensor aimed at M2M and smart cities, the possibilities of IoT are clear: "by 2050, the world will be full of sensors and it will be possible to integrate them to any communication protocol," she told an MWC session on IoT.
