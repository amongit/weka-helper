A new patent by Apple aims to help find your iPhone even when it's turned off. When the owner uses the Find My iPhone app to locate a missing iPhone, it would trigger a low-power event on the phone when powered down to pinpoint the location.
This may raise privacy concerns that the phone is always tracking its current location, but it should make many iPhone owners feel more secure.
