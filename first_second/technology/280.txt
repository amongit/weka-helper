It's been a decade and a half since the Indian IT industry began its ascendancy into the IT services stratosphere, quickly becoming a key supplier of much of the world's IT-related software services needs. Today, it is a $100 billion-plus industry, with around $35 billion of business emanating from the US alone.
But as it wends its way along the evolutionary path, some things have been made clear to even the casual observer: The industry is quickly becoming commoditised, and will rapidly go the way of the Indian call centre sector (which saw a lot of its business migrate to the cheaper, English-speaking Philippines), and there is little differentiation between Indian IT firms when it comes to services. This means that many contracts are won and lost on price.
