The Mayor of London's office announced on Tuesday that many London Underground stations will get Wi-Fi access in summer 2012 through a deal with Virgin Media. More than 80 stations will have the service in the summer, with up to 120 stations in total connected by the end of 2012.
The service will be free initially, becoming chargeable at an unspecified rate after an unspecified sporting event — widely thought to be the Olympics — occurring in the capital during the summer, Virgin Media told ZDNet UK, although it intends to keep the service free for its existing customers. Travel information will remain free for all.
