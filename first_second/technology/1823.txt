As we head toward Monday's announcement of the CRM Watchlist 2015 winners and we travel more deeply into an era defined by customer engagement, it becomes important to find the practitioners who are creating the engagement initiatives in different venues. There is a group of vertical industries that I call "emotional verticals." These are the industries that individuals have a strong emotional involvement with, the industries that are in the forefront of defining many engagement initiatives. Think retail, sports, entertainment, health services/wellness, financial services, travel, and of course, hospitality as a good solid group of those kinds of vertical industries.
In my never ending quest for truth in strategy, I spoke with a great friend of mine, Rich Toohey about these matters. Rich is a practitioner who has reached the level of subject matter expert, and is well versed in how to think about engagement. This guy has been active speaking around the CRM world on this very subject.
