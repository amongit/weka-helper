People in the Netherlands with government-related business to take care of would probably agree that yesterday was not the best of days to do it. In what initially appeared to be a simple glitch, all Dutch government websites went down on Tuesday morning, only coming back up more than twelve hours later.
Initially, it was thought that the cross-site outage was related to problems with the fibre broadband network, since, as well as the government websites, several other big Dutch sites went down - and they were all hosted by the same company, Prolocation.
