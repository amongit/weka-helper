Researchers in Japan have reported successfully producing a single layer of silicon atoms - or silicene - opening a debate about what silicene actually is.
Back in April, a group of researchers in Europe, led by Patrick Vogt, reported "compelling experimental evidence forâ€¦ two dimensional silicon" in a paper published in Physical Review Letters, the first reported synthesis of the material.
