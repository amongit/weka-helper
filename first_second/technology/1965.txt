Computer science: Most of us don't even know what it is. It seems distant and even a bit confronting. What does it mean? How is it used? Indeed, most students -- and even more adults -- don't know anything about computer science, and there are so many misconceptions about it that too many people are afraid to even try it.
Moreover, since computer science is a relatively recent field -- at least compared to chemistry, English or history -- educators high in the schooling hierarchy are not willing to substitute it for a subject that has existed for some time and works. But it is precisely because we live in this modern world that this recent subject is so incredibly important; everything around us was in some sense affected by code, and yet most of us cannot even write a simple program that calculates how much gas we use in a year.
