As we head towards spring it appears that state legislators' thoughts turn to ways to attract data center construction in their states. Given the limited amount of options that the government has to do this, the method of choice is tax abatement. Property taxes, equipment tax, employment taxes, and sales tax are all fair game in attracting the construction of data centers.
The Nevada Bill (Senate Bill 170) uses sales and property taxes as the hook. The bill would provide partial sales and property tax abatements for 20 years if the data center operator meets an investment requirement of $250 million and is able to provide a minimum number of long-term employment opportunities. Nevada hopes to make the requirements sufficiently flexible to attract colocation operators, whose employment opportunities and local spending often vary based on tenants, as well as dedicated facilities.
