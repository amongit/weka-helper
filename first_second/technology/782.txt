Red Hat is introducing new identity management features as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1, including a much-anticipated two-factor authentication option based on FreeOTP.
Not to be outdone, Microsoft will introduce a native multi-factor authentication infrastructure in Windows 10. Both operating system releases are due out by this summer.
