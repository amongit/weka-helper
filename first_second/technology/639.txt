I just spent the past few weeks of my "side project" time working on a membership Web site for a professional organization I belong to. I based the site on WordPress, adding a bunch of plug-ins and writing about a thousand lines of custom PHP code to glue everything together. During this process, I refined my toolset considerably since my last WordPress project, and in this article, I'll share with you how I set up my working environment.
One note: I'm not going to talk about plug-ins or individual WordPress components. Instead, I'll be talking about the tools used to manage all of that. I should also note that because this was a pro-bono project (meaning I donated my time to a good cause), I wanted to spend as little as possible on tools. I got some great discounts and used some free tools. Let's get started.
