Tablet computers have permeated the classroom in the last few years. Companies including Microsoft, Apple and Samsung have issued free devices, software and services to insinuate themselves into the classroom -- not only giving students more access to technology no matter their background, but potentially also to influence the next generation of consumers toward a particular brand or operating system.
However, no matter the reasons, technology has the potential to enrich a learner's experience in the classroom and give teachers more access to resources, lesson ideas and subject matter. Tablets, due to their portability and app support, remove the need to trudge over to a computer room to access the Web -- and can stored safely away after a lesson.
