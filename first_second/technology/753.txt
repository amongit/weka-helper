Undoubtedly in Simon Hackett and Bill Morrow, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has found two of the most passionate people in the industry to appoint to NBN Co, and both are keen to leave their mark on the telecommunications landscape in Australia. The question is: Will Turnbull let them?
The appointment of Internode founder Simon Hackett to the NBN Co board was broadly welcomed by the industry and the public. Although Hackett had been highly critical of the NBN in the past, he was seen as an impartial and highly knowledgeable technology advocate with ideas that would help the implementation of the government's project.
