There's an old adage that on the internet, nobody knows you're a dog. It's been previously used to demonstrate that it's hard, if not impossible at times, to determine whether someone really is who they say they are — be it man, woman, or dog — but it equally applies to hackers.
Although offline, it's easy enough to connect with someone's day-to-day personality, it doesn't offer any insight into who they are and how they act online. Let's face it, as much as Hollywood might lead us to believe that hackers gain their street cred from hacking via sophisticated 3D-modelled file systems, or that two people typing on one keyboard doubles a computer's hacking abilities, the more boring reality is that it's mostly done by typing commands into a terminal shell (and I don't mean "access security").
