This is quite the event: Bill Gates, ultra-billionaire brains behind Microsoft and perhaps the Nerd King, making his debut appearance on the Nerdist podcast. Host Chris Hardwick and his two co-hosts Jonah Ray and Matt Mira, are granted a 40-minute audience with Gates, somewhere in the bowels of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation HQ in Seattle. The occasion was the recent release of the Foundations annual "Letter" -- a humanitarian manifesto of sorts that spells out difficulties in the world, the Gates' plans to thwart those problems.
