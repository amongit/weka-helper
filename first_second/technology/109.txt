Amid ongoing criticisms over water pollution caused by untreated wastewater from a plant in southern Taiwan, the Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Chairman Jason Chang apologized on December 16 for causing public disturbance, according the state-run Central News Agency (CNA).
Chang told a news conference in Taipei that all wastewater management problems at the offending plant, K7, have been fixed, and that the plant's operation remains normal.
