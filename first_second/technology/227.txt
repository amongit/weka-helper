The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the most active mobile markets in the world.
According to the country's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), the UAE hit 200 percent penetration for mobile devices as far back as 2009, while research compiled last year by Statista (using data from Google's Our Mobile Planet survey) reported that the UAE had the highest level of smartphone penetration anywhere in the world.
