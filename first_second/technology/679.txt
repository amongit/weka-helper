Hybrid cloud backup technology is not new. Vendors in the backup hardware business were quick to take advantage of the information lifecycle approach to backup to make use of the cloud as an additional target for archival storage. Traditionally, the approach taken has been to offer a range of appliances, targeted at different size enterprises, with local capacity sized to meet the customer's need.
Many appliance vendors also have limited the cloud storage vendors supported, narrowing the possibilities of problems and limiting the support issues. And with the goal of supporting enterprise customers or only the cutting edge of the SMB space, vendors have priced their appliances accordingly.
