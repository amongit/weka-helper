The product I've been most impressed with so far this year isn't digital â€” it's an electric desk by Anthro, the Oregon-located makers of ergonomic technology furniture. I've been using their Elevate II desk for a few weeks, and it already feels completely indispensable and a surprisingly big life change, much like the feeling I got when I first used an iPad.
