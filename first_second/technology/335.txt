The European Court of Justice has upheld a €152m fine handed out to Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica for abusing its dominant position in the Spanish broadband market.
The fine — which was a record for a European telecoms firm at the time — relates to a period from 2001 to 2006, and was first handed out way back in 2007 by the EU General Court. Telefonica subsequently appealed the original decision, but the European Court of Justice has dismissed its claims and demanded that the fine be paid in full.
