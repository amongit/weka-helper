ARM has bolstered its new mbed OS for Internet of Things devices with the acquisition of a Netherlands-based security software firm, Offspark.
The acquisition, announced today, gives the UK-based ARM Offspark's PolarSSL technology, which the company claims is the most widely deployed transport layer security system (TLS) for encrypting traffic between for embedded devices.
