One of the biggest success stories of the Estonian technology scene in recent years is a business that has ties to the country's best-known tech heavyweight, Skype. And, like Skype before it, it's a company based around a disarmingly simple business idea that sprung from the need for change in a very traditional industry.
Several years ago, Estonian Taavet Hinrikus, Skype's first employee, had just moved to London and faced a practical problem: he wanted to move money from his Estonian bank account to his UK bank account. However, if he wanted to do so, he have to put up with losing five percent of the money transferred to the bank â€“ an amount largely hidden in the interbank exchange rate.
