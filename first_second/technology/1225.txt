A friend of mine runs a university lab that studies users' eye movements as they read web pages. There is an actual science to measuring the way sites are viewed, where the eyes fall first, how they move across the screen, and how long they stay on specific page elements. This information gathered from these sessions is used to make recommendations to improve the overall user experience (UX), as well as help site designers get more mileage.
Eye movement-tracking may be an intricate solution for the UX challenge, but there are also simpler, and less snoopy, ways software developers and designers can keep tabs on how users are viewing interfaces. We're talking about employing key performance indicators (KPIs) to track users' experiences with software and services. As Armen Ghazarian shares in a recent post, KPIs can help software and service designers assess how well their interfaces are being received, whether they are creating any issues, and what design schemes are delivering the best results.
