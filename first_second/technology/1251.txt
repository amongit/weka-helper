At ZDNet's TechBizz SG earlier this month, I remember chuckling hearing the contrast in answers from the panelist representing small businesses versus the CTOs and folks that advise large corporations. The panelist basically added a healthy dose of: "Get real, just use the tool to get the thing done. No one has time for all this other overheads . Want to do a video conference? Just use Skypeâ€¦ no need to ask an IT team".
That reflects the reality for many small businesses. For example, do I really have to spend thousands of dollars on a full-fledged video conferencing system or can employees just use Skype and Web cams? How much will I lose by using Skype's consumer-quality connection and uptime versus a system with guaranteed service levels? I would imagine not much.
