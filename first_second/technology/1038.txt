Ericsson is shedding over 2,000 jobs in Sweden as part of a shake-up of its R&D activities and an ongoing shift towards outsourcing manufacturing.
Employees in the company's home market of Sweden will bear the brunt of a cost-cutting program announced in November last year, which aims to bring in total savings of around SEK 9bn ($1bn) by 2017.
