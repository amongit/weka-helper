Nearly a year after the infamous gangrape on a bus in Delhi, the Indian government is set to roll out GPS-linked panic buttons on public transport and a mobile app with a similar feature, reports The Times of India.
There are already some mobile apps available for women's safety, such as Damini and Fightback , to name a few. What makes this program different and unique is that it's the first time the Indian government is directly involved in the process. While further details regarding this panic app will be released soon, it's safe to assume that with the government's direct involvement, there will be coordination between local police control rooms and users.
