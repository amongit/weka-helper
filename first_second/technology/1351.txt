Before Microsoft's January 21 Windows 10 reveal, a lot of information had leaked about Microsoft's new Windows 10 browser, codenamed "Spartan."
During yesterday's event, Microsoft officials showed off a glimpse of Spartan in action, promising that it would be available to testers in its Technical Preview program in the coming months. The first public preview of Windows 10 mobile for Windows Phones and under eight-inch tablets is coming in February, but it won't include Spartan, Microsoft officials confirmed. And next week's January Technical Preview test build of Windows 10 for desktops won't include Spartan yet, either, Microsoft execs have confirmed.
