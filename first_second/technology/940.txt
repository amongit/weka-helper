Dell has updated its storage portfolio to include support for its Fluid File System.
By bringing the Fluid File System to the Dell Compellent FS8600 NAS on Tuesday, the company has given enterprise users the ability to manage block and file storage via the same system across all three of its key storage lines â€” Compellent, EqualLogic and PowerVault.
