There is a growing concern that the shutdown of part of the Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) plant in southern Taiwan, due to recent water pollution accusations, might benefit its rivals, according to market analysts cited by the state-run Central News Agency (CNA).
According to CNA, in analysts' opinions, possible beneficiaries of the predicament of ASE, the world's largest IC packaging and testing services provider enjoying roughly 30 percent global market share, include Taiwan-based Siliconware Precision Industries, South Korea-based Amkor Technology, and Singapore's STATS-ChipPAC.
