O2, one of the largest U.K. mobile networks, said millions were affected by the outage that saw its phones unable to make calls, send text messages, or do anything for that matter.
Around Wednesday lunchtime , O2 updated its status pages to warn that there were "problems affecting some customers' mobile service." Three hours later, when the situation was getting somewhat out of hand, O2 took to Twitter to calm angry customers.
