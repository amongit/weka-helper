Microsoft officials went public with some new details about its strategy for enabling developers to write once and run on any version of Windows during a deep-dive session at Mobile World Congress on March 2.
(I'm not at MWC and Microsoft's "First look at the Windows 10 Universal App Platform" event for developers is not being live streamed. But there are lots of good tweets covering the event, as well as a blog post from Director of the Windows Developer Platform Kevin Gallo summarizing the content presented.)
