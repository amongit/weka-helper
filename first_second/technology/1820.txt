Each year that I do the Watchlist, it gets harder and harder to win. Not because many of the companies that submit questionnaires aren't great or good; not because the companies aren't performing to their potential; not because I'm a hardnosed scorer - though I am. It's because market conditions are constantly changing and it's increasingly difficult to keep up with the changes, meet customer demand, stay in the black and have the kind of impact that gets you the mind share and market share you need as a company to continue to grow effectively.
