I used to spend a lot of time forecasting - "Here's what I expect to see in 20-whatever." Then I would look at how I did -- and I had a good time both laughing at myself (for my errors) and patting myself on the back. But ultimately, the forces that drive the universe aren't in enough of my control or anyone else's to really give a damn about my -- or any other -- forecasts, predictions, prognostications or wild speculations. I can only control what I actually do in that universe and then try to understand, never faultlessly, the impact that my (or anyone's) actions have on that universe or things in it.
But I do have some observations that I want to throw out there that you can take or leave as you care to. They aren't exactly random, but they aren't exactly totally related either. However, they will define my 2015 discussions and analyses to a large extent.
