There is often a significant delay between astonishing discoveries in science and their exploitation in technology. That's often because although the physics works, getting the engineering to play ball in the real world is hard. Superconducting materials that work at liquid nitrogen temperatures are a good example of this phenomenon.
During that delay, existing technologies have a chance to play catch-up â€” and perhaps silicon is doing that to graphene as we speak. Researchers in Romania and Greece report creating a silicon-based field-effect-transistor (FET) that mimics the electrical properties of graphene.
