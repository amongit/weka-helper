Procedural oversight of privacy, freedom of information (FOI) and other administrative functions has been overhauled in the Budget with the disbanding of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the reallocation of its constituent tasks to other government agencies.
From 1 January 2015, the OAIC – an umbrella body formed in November 2010 to encompass FoI, privacy, information management and other functions – will no longer exist as a unified organisation.
