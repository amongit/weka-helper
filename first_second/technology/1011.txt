Google is making a push into the enterprise with the launch of Android for Work. The initiative is aimed at the BYOD crowd, enabling work profiles for smartphones and tablets. This allows IT departments to deploy approved apps to workers in a controlled and secure manner.
Android for Work allows employees to use personal apps alongside the work apps, while keeping personal data safe from employer access.
