I’ve blogged previously on the impact that cloud is having on innovations in the data centre. It’s a constantly evolving story – and one that keeps most of us in the industry on the edge of our seats, reflecting just how deep and pervasive cloud computing has become in the IT enterprise landscape.
Some of these data centre advancements include rethinking how data centres are cooled, including floor design to optimise cooling and airflow, and new concepts such as solar power. The changes are fundamentally necessary and the equation is simple; data centres are costly to run so design needs to be more efficient.
