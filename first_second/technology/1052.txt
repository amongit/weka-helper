Much of Sweden's fixed-line broadband became collateral damage as a result of a DDoS attack on a mystery gaming site this week.
While DDoS attacks are par for the course for most online businesses these days, the vast majority of these attacks don't go on to affect the broadband connections of an entire country. But that's what happened to customers of Telia, Sweden's largest ISP, for 45 minutes on Tuesday night and then again intermittently throughout Wednesday afternoon and evening.
