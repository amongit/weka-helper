Despite cloud technologies being adopted at a relentless pace there is always a question mark about security. In fact, it’s the thing I’m most often asked about. Of course, any would-be user of cloud services must ask the questions: ‘Where is my data, who has access to it, and how it is being protected?’ These are valid questions.
However, I believe that many of the fears around cloud security are largely unjustified. To start with, the word ‘cloud’ creates a sense of intangibility, in which data apparently floats around in some kind of stratospheric no man’s land and is zapped down to a physical location when it’s called for. This perception has partly been brought about by the hype surrounding cloud technologies.
