Singapore-based startup Clozette has just closed a Series B funding with US$3 million, raising its current total funding to US$6.06 million. The round was led by Phillip Private Equity, and brought back previous investor, Seed Ventures IV.
The startup has 300,000 members across the Southeast Asian region, and racks up monthly pageviews of 8 million, it said. Clozette is a fashion portal that collates about 3,500 brands from various retailers such as Burberry and Club 21 under its site. Its differentiating service is its social media element, where it aims to let users discover new items to wear from other users' public pinboards.
