Estonia's first 4G network went live in 2009, rolled out by the country's biggest mobile operator EMT - owned by TeliaSonera, the Swedish telco that launched the world's first commercial 4G network the same year.
For some time after, Estonia's mobile carriers could only use 1800MHz and 2600MHz spectrum for LTE, with operators mainly just deploying their 4G networks in bigger cities and towns. However, last spring it was announced that a tranche of 800MHz spectrum — freed up by Estonia's switch from analogue to digital television — was to be sold off by the country's Technical Surveillance Authority (TSA).
