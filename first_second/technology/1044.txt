Finnish mobile data operator Ukko Networks might be a small company, but it has no problems setting ambitious goals. In January, the year-old startup set both a new European 4G download speed record and announced plans to launch the fastest mobile network in Europe.
The record speed, 507Mbps of peak throughput, was achieved in Ukko Networks lab in Helsinki in an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) TDD demonstration. Currently the fastest commercial LTE-A networks (the next generation of 4G) achieve theoretical maximum download speeds of up to 225Mbps to 300 Mbps.
