On VDSL, Telecom New Zealand has spoken of downstream speeds of 15Mbps to 70Mbps, which is not far short of the 100Mbps promised by fibre-based Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB). The company claims VDSL offers customers a "stepping stone" to UFB, which may not arrive for some years yet.
VDSL is already available to around 60 percent of Kiwi homes, close enough to a phone exchange or cabinet, according to the telco.
