Cyanogen, the company behind CyanogenMod, started small. It began as a group of developers that wanted to produce a high-quality alternative Android firmware. Today, it still stands behind a great Android alternative, but its ambitions now go so high as to consider taking on Apple and Google.
The company's CEO, Kirt McMaster, has criticized iOS and Android for being mere "shells" for Google and Apple services. In addition, McMaster has complained about Google requiring OEMs to accept Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play store and other services as a single bundle in order to use Google's official Android. Indeed, McMaster has gone so far as to declare that "We're going to take Android away from Google."
