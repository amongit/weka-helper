According to industry analysts, the amount of data being directly managed in enterprise datacenters will grow 14 fold over the next eight years. Thatâ€™s a lot of information. It also implies a lot of infrastructure. But there is an irony here.
As most CIOs understand, the business value of the IT department is only loosely correlated to the infrastructure they manage. The real value is the information contained in the datacenter. And that data is not worth much if the data is not safe and accessible. Therefore the datacenter needs to be architected in a way that stored information is highly available and applications consuming it have efficient and reliable access. How do you do that?
