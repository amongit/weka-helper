As reported by AltEnergyStocks.com, storage was clearly the primary story at the 2014 InterSolar conference, which is the most well-attended solar conference in North America. Walking through the conference there were two noticeable changes from last year: 1) the diminished presence of the major solar developers which accentuated the growing "commoditization" of the industry; and 2) the increased prominence of the energy storage companies.
It is clear that the solar industry has entered a bright new phase of solar-related storage market and application development. Its versatility and adaptability is a major factor as with the right technology, solar energy can be stored during the middle of the day and shifted for use whenever it is needed. This was understood at 2013 InterSolar. So what has changed for storage to turn a cover and play a starring role in the photovoltaic (PV) industry?
