I’ve given a number of webinars, presentations, etc., lately regarding the resurgent war for talent. Some of the main points I hammer in include:
What’s going on is a recovering economy that needs workers while employers are finding fewer and fewer qualified folks available to fill the growing number of vacancies. This is all the more ironic given that many of the firms that are squawking the loudest may be companies that did so little to develop the talent they already have.
