If you look at human beings, there is one thing and one thing only that we all have in common: We want to be happy. To each of us, the idea of happiness is different, how we choose to achieve it is different, and the divergences and convergences on our individual paths to happiness are different. What this means is that each of us seeks our own path in the journey toward happiness, with the idea of being happy all along the way there -- wherever "there" happens to be. To put it in a single statement, all humans are self-interested.
What that means when it comes to business acumen is that you have to be aware of what a customer wants, and give them what you are able to give in order to make them happy -- but within the constraints that govern you as a company, be they budgetary, time, or regulatory. To translate that practically, it means that if you are a technology company, you have to be able to identify what you offer that your customers can use to get the outcomes they need to achieve their goals. This means your salespeople have to be savvy enough to understand that when they are in front of a buyer, they not only have to sell from the standpoint of the value to the buyer's company, but to the buyer's needs as well. It also means that your marketing has to be focused on the outcomes that you would expect your likely buyers to be looking for.
