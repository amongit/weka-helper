With artificial intelligence, the fast pace of research and the scale of its potential benefits mean that tech companies are increasingly moving full-steam ahead without considering the risks.
At the beginning of this year, Elon Musk, the creator of Tesla and SpaceX, donated $10m to the Future of Life Institute to fund a global research program aimed at making sure AI benefits the human race. The institute is a volunteer-run research and outreach organization co-founded in March last year by Jaan Tallinn, one of the most well-known Estonian tech entrepreneurs for his role as the founding engineer of Skype and Kazaa.
