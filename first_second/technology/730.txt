Now that communications minister Malcolm Turnbull has put the national broadband network (NBN) and the entire telecoms industry into idle – while we wait for the results of the Telstra renegotiations and the findings of the Vertigan cost-benefit analysis (CBA) review – we have time to revisit and reassess the findings of the last official output we have seen from the current government.
That, of course, is the NBN Strategic Review (NBNSR) – completed in six weeks and handed down as gospel last December. This highly speculative document has been constructed and feted with an air of authority, yet was torn down in the interim report delivered by the Senate Select Committee on the NBN back in March – which was, predictably and despite its rather voluminous size, both refuted by the committee's Coalition members and completely ignored by the government.
