MacStadium, most likely the best known and most successful of the Mac Mini datacenter hosting services, is expanding their offering this week by adding the Mac Pro to their server hardware list. This should make their offerings even more appealing to the Mac-centric users looking for hosted services, but whether it will allow them to compete successfully for enterprise customers who are server hardware agnostic is another question.
There is no question that the Mac Pro makes an awesome development platform for building applications, 3D modeling, or professional grade video projects. Its core Intel Xeon E5 hardware can be found in enterprise class server products from other top-of-the-line vendors.
