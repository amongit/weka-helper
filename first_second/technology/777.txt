Enterprise identity architects will have to scale their systems and consider new features in order to morph from a people-centric ID service to one that encompasses the complexity of interactions envisioned with the Internet of Things concept, according to Gartner research VP Earl Perkins.
"Things" being deployed in the enterprise and in the cloud will need identities and access controls. This will create the need for an "Identity" of Things (IDoT) extension to current identity management systems, according to Gartner.
