Apple is said to have ordered six million watches to be manufactured for the next quarter. So, what's the deal? Here are the things you can do with an Apple watch, assuming that you have $350 (or much more if you want a solid gold one.)
The first challenge is understanding how to make the various functions work, which will really be challenging since the screen is so small and there are only two tiny buttons on the side. Of course you can visit the Genius Bar at your local Apple store but the curse of grade inflation is found even here. The last two times I tried this, with a simple request for Apple cell phone and Outlook synching, either I caught them on a bad day or the availability of geniuses has declined dramatically. The Apple geniuses were modestly incompetent despite being nice people and sporting red Apple t-shirts.
