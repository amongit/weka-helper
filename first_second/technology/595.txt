If you read this blog regularly, you'll be familiar with my discussion of how little has changed in a century of paperwork. We went from ink, quills, parchment scrolls, and tally sticks to the typewriter, metal filing cabinets, and formal snail mail systems in the industrial revolution.
Since then, we've basically digitized the document/mail/filing work paradigm. Business contracts have been documents, typically requiring formal signatures, and the fax machine is still an essential bit of kit in many law offices and paper-contract-heavy businesses. Asian calligraphic cultures rely on hand written documents, so fax and scanning are especially dominant for those transactions and communications.
