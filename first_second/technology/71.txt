I hate to split hairs on terminology. Arguing about definitions is rarely productive. But semantics frame our view of the world, so it is critical to at least reflect on what certain words mean. Take hybrid cloud, a popular buzzword this year.
Some people consider any environment that includes both on-premises environments and public cloud services to be a hybrid cloud. While true in the most literal sense, if these hybrid services operate in complete isolation from one another, then they are not truly hybrid and they may add more complexity than value to the solution architecture.
