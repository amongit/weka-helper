There's been a rising chorus of debate lately about the roles and value of open APIs, which are intended to project an organization's data or services to broader audiences. Some prominent companies, such as ESPN, have announced they were retiring their public open APIs, while others are intent on building out new business opportunities with their APIs.
As with any breed of software and services, enterprises need to carefully deliberate the business purposes of the open APIs they intend to design and provide to the outer world. Business value needs to be the guiding force behind any open API implementation.
