In the United States, Super Bowl Sunday is the biggest holiday of the sports year. Watching it is easy. You just get together with your fellow fan friends at whomever's home has the biggest HDTV and bring out the beer and chips. But, if you can't get to a TV, or if you're out of the country, you can still watch the National Football League's championship over the Internet.
If you're living in the States, or Mexico, all you need to do is watch NBC's live stream of the game on the NBC Sports Web site. You'll also be able to view the same stream on the NFL's NFL.com or SuperBowl.com.
