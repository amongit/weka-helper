Indonesian telco Indosat has been trying to find ways to persuade its corporate clients to undergo the migration to BES 10. It was reported it is first targeting about 10 of its 40-50 existing customers, with intensive talks underway with top-tier customers.
Despite the new features in BES 10 , such as increasing the number of users from 2,000 to 10,000 devices per server, customers are still not biting yet.Considering the fact that 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies and 19,000 businesses have adopted BES 10 upon its launch a few months ago, the number Indosat booked may appear to be small. Only one company so far, retailer Alfamart, has given the nod and moved forward to the platform.
