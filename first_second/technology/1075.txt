Debian's technical committee has thrown its lot in with systemd, after chairman Bdale Garbee gave the casting vote that decided the fractured and heated debate over which init system Debian would use in future releases.
As expected, the final vote came down to a 4:4 tie between systemd and upstart, with Garbee needed to break the deadlock.
