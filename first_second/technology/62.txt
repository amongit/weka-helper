I recently ran across an old press release of a study by IDC which stated that at that time (June 2011), there were 1.8 zettabytes of data in the world. I don’t know what a zettabyte is, but the press release helped put this in perspective by saying it was equivalent to 200 billion feature length HD movies.
Oh yes, and there was one more thing. The press release said that the amount of data in the world is doubling every 2 years. That means that there must be about 3.6 zettabytes out there now. That’s seriously big data.
