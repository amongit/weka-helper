I think it's safe to say that anyone who watches Lost in Space reruns loves robots. We love that guy. "Danger, Will Robinson, alien life form approaching. My sensors indicate a hostile presence." And the way he would groan out a gutteral "Uuuuuuuhhhhh," when Dr. Smith removed his powerpack on almost every episode.
We all reference the "Three Laws of Robotics" or have them referenced on various cartoons and sitcoms. And we cringed at Transformer battles, where robots, huge in stature and loaded to the hilt with advanced weapons couldn't hit each other. Now, we have Big Hero 6 â€” a boy, his four friends, and a robot named Baymax.
