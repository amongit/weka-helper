Often, when governments propose unpopular measures, a quid pro quo occurs and the electorate receives something in return. A lack of such arrangements sent 13 British colonies into rebellion over 200 years ago, so the idea is far from being new or revolutionary.
However, in recent times, when it comes to increasing the powers of intelligence and policing organisations across much of the developed world, all that has been offered in return are feelings of protection and comfort, and, as a pair of instances have shown recently, having an existing metadata regime or preservation notice scheme cannot prevent the types of events that they were designed to prevent.
