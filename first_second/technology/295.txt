Some statistics were recently disclosed about how messaging apps in India have done over the last year, and it's no surprise that WhatsApp is a clear leader, with a user base of 70 million and 52 percent market share. It is followed by Facebook Messenger, with 42 percent, and Skype, with 37 percent market share. However, what is a real shocker is how well Chinese behemoth Tencent's app WeChat has done by grabbing a market share of 26 percent in just a year or so, according to a GlobalWebIndex (GWI) study. Trailing them are Viber, with 18 percent share, and Line, with 12 percent.
Numbers are often a funny business. For instance, homegrown messenger Hike, which was created by Bharti SoftBank a few years ago, claimed a user base of 35 million in August this year, but it doesn't figure anywhere in GlobalWebIndex's report.
