Tablets are now widely used in business, and are delivering tangible productivity improvements. However, there's plenty of scope for improving tablet devices, with users regularly reporting issues such as short battery life, broken screens, and overheating.
These are the headline conclusions of a survey, published today, carried out by Dynamic Markets on behalf of Panasonic Toughpad. A total of 2,362 interviews were carried out, split evenly between tablet users (49 percent) and purchasers (51 percent), across nine EU countries (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Turkey, Poland and Benelux).
