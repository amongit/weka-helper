The Taiwan branch of Japan's Line Corp, creator of the fast-growing social messaging app Line, will be expanded by five to 10 times in 2014, in a bid to create more localized "stickers" and mobile content for the market in Taiwan, according to Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency (CNA).
The popularity of the mobile app is driven by its popular oversized emoticons, or stickers. There are 7 billion daily messages and over 1 billion stickers sent by worldwide users, according to LINE. According to CNA, the Taiwan branch has recruited about 10 employees since its establishment in May, and it is for certain that more staff members for marketing, sales, information technology, and design are needed.
