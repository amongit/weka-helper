On Tuesday, the Dutch data protection authority, College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens (CBP), announced that it will be launching an investigation into Facebook's forthcoming changes to its privacy policy.
The reason for the probe, according to CBP, is the new privacy policy "allows Facebook to use details and photos from Facebook profiles for commercial purposes".
