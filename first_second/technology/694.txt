This morning, HP announced the immediate availability of two new server cartridges, the m710 and 350, for the high-density Moonshot server chassis system. Along with the two new hardware configurations, four application-specific solutions have also been introduced. The new application-specific solutions are application delivery, managed web hosting, video transcoding, and web infrastructure in a box. Each solution is designed to take full advantage of the hardware capabilities of the cartridges just announced.
For the m710, which is built around the Xeon E3-1284L v3 with built-in Intel Iris Pro Graphics 5200 (delivering four Haswell cores and the GPU in the same package), HP is providing an application delivery system with Citrix XenApp. XenApp allows virtual application delivery to multiple platforms, giving workers on any supported platform access to Windows applications in their own secure environment. XenApp is able to make use of the embedded GPU, simplifying the deployment of a large-scale virtual application infrastructure.
