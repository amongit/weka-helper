Last year was an exceptionally active one for the Philippine IT industry. Despite the economic gloom that descended on other parts of the globe, the local tech scene throbbed with activities. In fact, I was so busy covering the unfolding events that I only managed a few posts in this blog (I promise to make it up this year).
But back to the topic, 2012 saw the Philippines register strong economic growth and record historic highs in the local stock market. The country's multi-billion BPO (business process outsourcing) sector also solidified its leading position in the call center business while making significant inroads in the non-voice market.
