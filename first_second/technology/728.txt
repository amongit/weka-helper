The most tragic thing about today's release of the government audit of Labor's national broadband network (NBN) program is not its contents but the fact that Malcolm Turnbull will, as everyone knew he would, believe it – and ignore the fact that he has instigated an even bigger policy disaster in the making.
Turnbull's callous and ongoing disregard for reality will surely see him feting the report's findings on the evening news, while using its preordained findings to obscure the fact that he has already shot himself in the foot with his white-elephant gun – and, in so doing, wound back the prospect of real industry progress by a decade.
