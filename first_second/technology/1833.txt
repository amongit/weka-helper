While names like Workday, Oracle, SAP and others may be well known in the financial accounting software space, few firms penetrated so many large enterprises so quickly and so quietly in the cloud financial software sector as BlackLine.
Two quick statistics point out why more businesses, investors and others should pay more attention to BlackLine. First, the company has crossed the 1,000 client mark. Second, two thirds of those customers are publicly traded firms on one of two dozen or so global securities exchanges. Many traditional financial software vendors would kill for that customer list.
