Cortado, formerly known as ThinPrint and still perhaps best known for its printer virtualisation technology, has announced an upgrade to its Cortado Corporate Server (CCS) enterprise mobility management suite — from last year's version 7.0 to the new CCS 7.2.
Where CCS 7.0 concentrated on supporting iOS 7's business features, the focus of the new release is on mobile collaboration and productivity for users not only of iOS tablets and smartphones, but also Android — specifically Samsung Galaxy — devices.
