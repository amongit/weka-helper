Perhaps best known for its mapping of roads and thoroughfares, Google Street View also offers 360-degree panoramic images of landmarks such as Stonehenge and the Palace of Versailles, alongside university campuses, zoos, and theme parks such as Legoland California.
Street View — which has been prevalent in the US and parts of Europe for some time — is also increasingly being expanded to other parts of the world, with locations in Chile, Cambodia, and Botswana all being added to the service in the recent months.
