One of Estonia's best-known tech entrepreneurs, Sten Tamkivi, has been moving back and forth between several countries with his family for years. It's an experience that's shown him all the annoying hassles that come with being constantly on the move. As the former general manager for Skype in Estonia, Tamkivi knew that software could be the key to help getting rid of those niggles.
The idea for a startup that could help people across the globe to choose the most suitable places to live and work started to come together late last year. At the time, Tamkivi, who is also one of the brains behind the Estonian e-residency concept, was working at the venture capital firm Andressen Horowitz as the 'entrepreneur in residence'. There he met Balaji S Srinivasan, a general partner at Andressen Horowitz who was working on an article for Wired about cloud communities - and became a founder for the startup. The third co-founder was Silver Keskk√ºla who, like Tamkivi, was a Skype veteran who joined the VoIP company as a senior research engineer in 2005, the same year as Tamkivi.
