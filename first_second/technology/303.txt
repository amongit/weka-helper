Using remote datacentres for backup may be far from a new idea, but Estonia is taking it to a new level, using facilities on allies' soil to provide a failover in the event of a national crisis.
Estonia has decided to go forward with the idea of digital data embassies. The concept was born during the discussions around the country's new cyber-defense strategy, and will see many databases and services deemed vital to the state's operation being duplicated in highly-secure datacentres, located in countries friendly to Estonia.
