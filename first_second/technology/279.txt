TechM, India's fifth-largest software services company under the Mahindra conglomerate's brand, which is looking to be referred to in the same breath as the elite trio of TCS, Wipro, and Infosys, announced a partnership a few days ago with IBM to create a platform on which its developers can build web-based apps for clients. The platform will leverage IBM's Bluemix dedicated cloud infrastructure.
Even though they may have a major interest in migrating to the cloud, not all companies are rushing to embrace cloud-based solutions. They still fret about things like security, performance, and control over proprietary data. The TechM-IBM solution aims to ease those pain points by offering a hybrid service allowing for enhanced flexibility and control of data, with clients essentially being allowed to design and choose their own cloud strategy.
