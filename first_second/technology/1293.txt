Yesterday BlackBerry announced BB 10 OS 10.3.1 started rolling out to previous generation BlackBerry 10 devices, including the Z10, Z30, Q10, Q5, and Z3.
The software update brings major enhancements to these existing devices. The update is rolling out in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific. It will be available across the entire line of BlackBerry 10 smartphones. I still have a T-Mobile BlackBerry Q10, but the update isn't available quite yet as it has to first pass through wireless carrier approval.
