IBM found the perfect test subject for its OpenPOWER bare metal servers---its own SoftLayer cloud division.Big Blue on Wednesday said that its SoftLayer cloud unit will be the first to use its OpenPOWER-based bare metal servers. The OpenPOWER systems are part of an effort to use the open source community to build on IBM's Power8 processors and develop infrastructure better suited to handle large data workloads.

Google has been among the early partners experimenting with IBM's processors. The first OpenPOWER summit will be held March 17-19 in San Jose. SoftLayer's OpenPOWER instances will be available in the second quarter. IBM said it worked with TYAN, which provides server and workstation platforms, and networking company Mellanox Technologies to develop the bare metal servers. What's unclear is how far beyond SoftLayer IBM's OpenPOWER bare metal servers can go. Enterprises and other cloud providers will need to adopt OpenPOWER at scale to tip the data center balance. OpenPOWER member Rackspace is a likely adopter at some point. Here's Rackspace's open hardware plan.SoftLayer will adopt the OpenPOWER bare metal servers in its Dallas, Texas cloud center and then expand around the world. Pricing for these instances will be detailed when generally available.
