Next month, on both December 14 and 15, Bangalore will host India's first Bitcoin conference, which is also Asia's second conference, according to The Times of India.
There is no shortage of Bitcoin holders in India, as recent figures indicate that there is a 50,000 strong Bitcoin community within India, and at least 30,000 of them own some of the virtual currency and have an online digital wallet for storing it. Naturally, the next step would be how to use the Bitcoins in India itself. With both investors and venture capitalists expected to attend the conference, officials from both the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India are also expected to attend the conference.
