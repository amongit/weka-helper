I’m beginning to think that the cloud computing discussion is, for most people, more about ‘when and what’ conversations than ‘will it happen’. But let’s not underestimate that ‘when to do it’ and ‘what will it be’ are two of the most challenging questions in the widespread establishment of cloud computing.
Some research recently came out from Cisco which reveals that adoption rates for cloud are slower than one might expect given all the hype. I’d say my experience shows more enthusiastic adoption already taking place, and I particularly agree with one of the sentiments expressed in the press release – that people still don’t always understand when they’re actually using cloud services.
