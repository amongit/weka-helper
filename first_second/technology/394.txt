With Microsoft's end of support for Windows Server 2003 now less than six months away, some customers' thoughts are turning to custom contracts that will allow them to continue to receive updates to that product.
After July 14, 2015, Microsoft will no longer issue fixes or updates of any kind for Windows Server 2003, as the company has been warning customers for a while now. Microsoft is continuing to advise customers still running that OS to move to Windows Server 2012 R2 (its most recently released version of Windows Server) and/or Azure.
