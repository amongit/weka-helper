NatWest hopes to have most of its customers' account balances rectified on Monday, the bank said on Sunday as the effects of a massive technical failure entered their sixth day.
The IT problem began late last Tuesday, making it impossible for many customers of NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank to access their accounts online or through ATMs, and stopping direct debits and standing orders from processing. The RBS Group was forced to open branches early in response, and even opened 1,200 branches on Sunday morning to assist customers.
