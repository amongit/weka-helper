There was something both pleasing and irritating about many of the presentations at the APIdays Sydney conference held earlier this week. Amongst all the talk of opening up your organisation's data through an application programming interface (API) and subjecting it to big data analytics, most of the speakers I listened to acknowledged that it raised privacy and ethical issues. That's great, but those issues never seemed to be explored beyond that acknowledgement.
As the conference wore on, and my irritation began to outweigh my pleasure, I decided to challenge a speaker about this. It just so happens that I chose Simon Dorrat, manager of strategy, architecture, and innovation for Toyota Australia's information systems division -- but really, I could have picked anyone.
