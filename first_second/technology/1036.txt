Finland is the latest country to jump on the 5G bandwagon, with its first fifth-generation test network being built in the northern city of Oulu.
The 5G Test Network (5GTN), led by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and University of Oulu in a consortium with industrial partners like Nokia, is scheduled to open in the latter half of the year. It will provide a test bed for 5G technologies, applications, and business models, with a research focus on network management, testing technology, and air interfaces.
