Taking a cue from Twitter, Instagram, and every other social media service out there, Facebook launched support for hashtags last week.
For those of you who don't know what a hashtag is, it's a word or phrase prefixed with a # that is commonly used to label a status update or photo. The hashtag is then searchable so you can find all posts with that hashtag, for instance, #lessonfortheday.
