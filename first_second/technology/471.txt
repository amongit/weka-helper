Hadoop 2.0 went GA back in October, 2013, but only for the Linux operating system.
That release of Hadoop, along with its "YARN" component, allows the Big Data technology to be used on petabyte-scale datasets without having to use the batch-oriented and laborious MapReduce algorithm. Moving beyond MapReduce is a big breakthrough, so the question of when the Hadoop 2.0 would be available for Windows has been lingering. Specifically, a release date for a Hadoop 2.0-based release of the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for Windows distribution is what we've needed, since Hortonworks is the only vendor with a full Windows-based Hadoop distro.
