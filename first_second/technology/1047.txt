Norway has a new international fibre carrier, after Tampnet recently announced it will start opening up access to its fibre network between Norway and the UK, which was historically only used by oil companies.
Tampnet's fibre network crosses the North Sea via the offshore oil platforms located there, using the shortest route between Norway and UK, both in terms of the geographical distance as well as data transit time due to number of hops and other latency-inducing network elements.
