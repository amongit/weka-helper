365DataCenters Chief Commercial Officer, Keao Caindec, and I spoke about net neutrality and what it means to businesses and to individuals. Net neutrality is a highly controversial topic that affects everyone who leverages the Internet for business or for personal use.
Mr. Caindec explains net neutrality in terms of the economic impact it will have and how 365 DataCenters is aligning itself to assist users and businesses with the transition.
