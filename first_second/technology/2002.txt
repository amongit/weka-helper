Imagine this: you're driving down the road, on a beautiful sunny day. Suddenly your windshield wipers turn on for just a few seconds and then go off. You prepare for the worst to happen, but everything continues on normally. A few days later, the same thing happens, and this time a few of the warning lights on the dash board come on at the same time. Again, it all goes away after just a few seconds. Now you're sufficiently concerned that you take the vehicle to the shop and they tell you they can't find anything wrong, and all of the vehicle systems are operating correctly at the moment. What happened?! You saw your car have a mini panic attack with your own eyes! Welcome to the modern age of computerized driving.
