Myanmar Payment Union (MPU) and payment services vendor 2C2P have teamed up to provide a new payment option for online shoppers in the Asian nation.
The service will allow consumers in Myanmar, for the first time, to pay online for their local and international purchases, 2C2P said in a statement Monday. The e-commerce payment platform is available to 900,000 holders of MPU cards, which are issued by banks in the country.
