Researchers in Florida have developed a doped form of graphene that makes graphene solar cells much more efficient. In an article in NanoLetters they report a power efficiency of 9 per cent, compared to 1.9 per cent for undoped graphene.
As we reported last month, the addition of quantum dots of lead sulphide to graphene makes the material absorb more of the light that falls of its surface.
