You've got to hand it to him. Australia's favourite Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis QC, is certainly one for efficiency. Last year, he wasted so much time on complicated spin and used car grade salesmanship in his push for mandatory telecommunication data-retention laws. But now, well, just read the words he poured into The Australian on Monday morning.
Brandis has squeezed back his propaganda strategy to the bare essentials, giving it an almost elegant minimalism. A scare story. A reminder that the government is our protector. A repeat of the metadata lie. A reminder that the spooks really, really want that metadata. And a final reassurance about freedom.
