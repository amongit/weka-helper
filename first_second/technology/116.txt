A strong move taken by the Taiwanese government has resulted in a positive response from US technology giant Apple, which corrected the description on the map about Taiwan.
According to Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Anna Kao, Apple has made a goodwill response by referring to the island simply as "Taiwan" on its map app, the state-run Central News Agency (CNA) has reported.
