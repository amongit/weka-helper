Vodafone has hired Phillipp Humm, who was until earlier this week the chief of T-Mobile USA, to head up its northern and central European operations.
The operating region is a new one, as Vodafone also announced on Thursday that it was splitting its European business in two: northern and central Europe, and southern Europe. The latter will be led by Paolo Bertoluzzo, already the chief executive of Vodafone Italy.
