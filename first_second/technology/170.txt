Global integrator CSC is shoring up its technical capabilities centers on Amazon Web Services (AWS) through Global Cloud Center of Excellence in Austin, Texas.
The facility will focus on development and migration of enterprise workloads over to AWS, and the integration of those services with hybrid and private cloud infrastructure, such as what's offered through CSC BizCloud. Also central to the collaboration is CSC's ServiceMesh Agility Platform, which is the integrator's solution for cloud orchestration and management.
