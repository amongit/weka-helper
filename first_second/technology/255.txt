Launched in 2010, the European Union's Digital Agenda set some ambitious targets for both broadband coverage and penetration in all of its member states
Under the 10-year plan, by 2020, all EU residents should be able to access broadband services capable of delivering speeds of at least 30 Mbps; and, by the same year, 50 percent of households should be signed up to ultrafast connections that deliver download speeds of 100Mbps and beyond.
