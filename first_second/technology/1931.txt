Mickael Jou is a photographer. And Mickael Jou is a dancer. His project "365 Photos" succinctly captures these two passions, in a series of urban snapshots that showcase the Taiwanese-French-American flexing his ballet skills all over Berlin. What sets him apart from the herd of choreographically inclined photographers, the artist explained to HuffPost, is that he does it all himself.
You see, his images are self-portraits, styled and enacted by Jou around cafes, supermarkets, attics and anything else he can assembl√© his way into.
