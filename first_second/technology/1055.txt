It's been a good week for Finnish mobile maker Jolla. Last Wednesday it announced a crowdfunding campaign to bring its first tablet to the market . Since then, the campaign has raised over $1.3m â€” triple the company's original goal.
Despite far outstripping its original funding goal of $380,000 within the first few hours after the Indiegogo campaign opened, Jolla COO Marc Dillon said the success of the campaign wasn't altogether unpredicted.
