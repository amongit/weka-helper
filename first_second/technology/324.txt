"It's a disaster. The evidence that Spain is a 'corruptocracy' in which any lobby can write laws at will (even ones as openly and clearly as insane as this one), in which certain media make its editorial line conditional upon government funding, and where the government has no idea how internet works," says Enrique Dans, consultant and professor at IE Business School.
"The media is going to lose clicks, visits, and, of course, advertising revenues. But mostly they will lose credibility because the role of the press is to monitor the power, not to support it," adds Carlos SÃ¡nchez Almeida, a lawyer specialising in ICT for Bufet Almedia.
