On Tuesday, the Italian government approved a plan to boost broadband connectivity in the country and reach connectivity goals set by the European Union's Digital Agenda plan.
The Digital Agenda, which all EU member states have signed up to, stipulates all countries in the union must ensure that 100 percent of their citizens have internet access at speeds of at least 30Mbps by 2020, and by the same year 50 percent of the population must have access to speeds of 100Mbps or more.
