Two years out from a promise to eclipse passwords, FIDO Alliance president Michael Barrett says conceptual roadblocks to success have vanished and progress in the next 6-12 months will bring legitimate strong authentication to the enterprise, help choke off major password hacks plaguing the Internet, and see hundreds of millions of FIDO-ready devices in the possession of people worldwide.
They are lofty expectations fraught with challenges, but Barrett’s optimism, refreshed at FIDO’s annual Plenary meeting earlier this month in Seoul, South Korea, is strong despite critics and buoyed by three recent and marquee F IDO deployments by Internet giants, Google , PayPal and Alipay, China’s leading online payment service.
