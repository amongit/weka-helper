Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell, Inc., told HuffPost Live at Davos on Friday he's disappointed in entrepreneurs and leaders who don't encourage a little risk taking.
"When you hear people talk about risks at Davos, many times they're talking about risk as a bad thing," Dell said. "The way I think about risk is, I want to take some risks. The most dangerous thing is not taking a risk."
