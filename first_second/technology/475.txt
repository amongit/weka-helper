There has been no shortage of new year's Big Data and Business Intelligence predictions in my inbox in the past month. As the predictions have trickled in, I was unsure of the value of running any one slate of predictions as an article in itself. But once they collected, I realized there's real value in reviewing a compilation of these predictions, seeing where they overlap, and appending a few predictions of my own.
The predictions come from a set of companies in the analytics world ranging from an Enterprise software company (TIBCO, makers of Spotfire); a publicly-traded Business Intelligence company (Tableau); an analytics applications platform start-up (Alteryx); a major NoSQL vendor (Basho); and a customer analytics company (Gainsight). Together, these companies paint an interesting picture of what the analytics state-of-the-art and market will look like in 2014.
