My prediction for 2014 is that this is the year when work communication will always get to you. Sure, there are many messages telling people to unplug, disconnect, and enjoy the non-digital life, but the reason there are those "movements" is because people want the opposite--they want to be always-on, always-connected, and always-communicating.
They want work to be a meaningful part of life...and that means work will always be there. What's making this possible? The cloud.
