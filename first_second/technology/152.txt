Some 38 percent of Singapore's traffic on price-checking site, PricePanda, now comes from mobile devices.
That's significant because the typical behavior on such sites tends to come from shoppers doing homework and comparing prices at home, usually on the desktop. The proportion of users doing this on the mobile is indicative of more shopping being done on mobiles --and more engaged shoppers doing price checks, rather than just making quick and casual purchases, on the phone.
