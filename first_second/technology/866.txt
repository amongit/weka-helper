The dramatic plunge in Windows XP's market share has continued in the latest numbers from Netmarketshare, released today (Monday). These show Windows XP dropping another 3.6 percentage points from 17.18 to 13.57 percent of the market, as measured by unique visitors to a global selection of websites. Meanwhile, Windows 8.1 has grown from 10.92 to 12.01 percent, and Windows 8 from 5.88 to 6.55 percent. This puts Windows 8/8.1 ahead of Windows XP by 18.56 to 13.57 percent.
It's remarkable for an operating system's market share to drop by 3.6 points in a single month. This is, after all, bigger than the current market share of Apple's Mac OS X 10.9 (2.79 percent). And as with similar remarkable drops revealed last month, I'm pretty sure it's not real. (See: Windows 8, 8.1 about to overtake plunging XP, on Netmarketshare's latest numbers )
