Cloud adoption in Asian cities remain low with governments harboring concerns about high upfront costs and associated risks such as data security and legal requirements.
Only 22.2 percent have adopted cloud technology to a moderate or extensive degree, with half of Asian cities surveyed pointing to upfront costs as the main reason why they have not deployed cloud more widely. Another 34 percent cited the lack of a strong business case as a barrier, while 28 percent noted the risks of cloud computing, according to a joint study conducted by Microsoft Asia-Pacific and CityNet.
