The season is upon us.
This year, 142 companies (out of 153 registrations) submitted their questionnaires. I have to say that there were some surprises, both good and bad. Winners that lost, winners that became honorable mentions, honorable mentions that won, new winners, elites that won but dropped from the elite category -- the shift was significant, more so than in years past. There were fewer winners and elites than ever, and more honorable mentions than ever, too.
