Singapore startup Nanoveu has figured out a way to mass produce nanoimprinted products, printing down to a resolution of a nanometerâ€”the dimensions of atomic particles.
There are plenty of potential applications for this, but the eight-man startup has kicked off its commercial portfolio with a set of iPhone and iPad screen protectors that allow users to view 3D movies on the devices without needing to wear 3D glasses. This is pretty similar to what the Nintendo 3DS has on its upper screen, for example.
