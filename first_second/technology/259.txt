When Chris Asego and his colleagues set out to launch a new technology startup two years ago in Nairobi, they began looking around for capital. They found a handful of angel investors and venture capital firms prepared to put money into Asego's Eneza Education, which provides academic tutoring material to any student with a mobile phone.
But none of Eneza's investors are Kenyan. Three out of five are American, and the other two are based in Tanzania. Asego didn't think it was worth looking for local investment. "To be honest, we didn't even try," he says, explaining that Kenya's own venture capitalists have a reputation for shying away from tech entrepreneurs like him.
