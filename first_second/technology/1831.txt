In line with my recent thinking about the importance of the health services market and the obvious criticality of a good health services system, here is some interesting thinking on the subject from Brad Bostic, CEO of HC1, an up-and-coming company in the health services industry.
They are proponents of HRM — Healthcare Relationship Management — and, while I can't say I've done enough homework to know that they are right, I think they might be onto something really interesting and valuable here. I know this: Brad is a smart, smart dude whose head is screwed on straight and HC1 is a company to watch in this industry. So take heed.
