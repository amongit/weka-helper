If you were a CIO trying to lead the business from the front and begin deeper transformation to digital/social engagement, what would be on your short list? I asked myself that question as I reviewed products based on some of the more interesting — or, in a few cases, only likely to be much-discussed — enterprise technologies of 2014 recently.
In my accompanying gallery , you can see a sampling of the products I examined, which made the mark if 1) they are breaking into the mainstream and/or 2) they are likely to have an outsize impact in their industry or otherwise unusually impressive growth rate, and 3) they reflect the priorities and sensitibilites of modern enterprise IT. The last basically meaning a focus on cloud, analytics, mobile, security, and better solutions for long-standing business problems like digital billing or customer self-service, the latter which has long had many solutions, but most of them have been poor ones or unsuccessful.
