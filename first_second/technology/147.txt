A cloud-based TV-recording device company is crowdsourcing funds to bolster its launch in Singapore, a service which will allow users to catch recorded programs across multiple devices.
The Bhaalu service will be launched in Germany, New York and Singapore in the first quarter of next year by VC-funded Belgian firm Right Brain Interface. It promises to marry free-to-air TV and Internet channels on its devices. The product is already on the shelves in Belgium and in the Netherlands.
