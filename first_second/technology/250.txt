A region that's more open and ready to address the needs of its citizens. That's what Tuscany hopes to become, with the launch of a new portal called Open Toscana. Online since late September, the website is a work in progress, with more services being added as the time goes on.
"We are trying to establish a more collaborative relationship with residents, both by aggregating existing services that were before scattered across several places online into a single portal, and adding new ones," regional councillor Vittorio Bugli told ZDNet.
