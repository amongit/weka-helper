There's always a lot of interest in Microsoft's various research operating systems (Midori, Drawbridge and Singularity and related projects), especially as the re-org last year put the people who'd been doing the research into the Operating Systems Group. Indeed, ex-head of Microsoft Research Rick Rashid was briefly in the OSG (although he's now moved on to the Office team).
But don't think of it as some kind of research takeover. It doesn't matter how many people from an OS research team move under the Windows umbrella; it still doesn't mean Microsoft is ever going to ship Drawbridge or Midori as a new version of Windows. It doesn't even mean that features from those research operating systems will ever ship inside Windows, at least in any directly recognisable form.
