Travel aggregators and Indian online travel agencies (OTAs) that take a cut on the tickets they sell must have received an almighty fright yesterday, when Google announced that its Flight Search business is being launched in India.
Anything that mentions Google and flight bookings may seem to potentially spell doom for online Indian travel entities like Yatra and Cleartrip, which have garnered significant venture capital money, and some like MakeMyTrip, which have gone public and command a pretty respectable market cap at a little over $1 billion.
