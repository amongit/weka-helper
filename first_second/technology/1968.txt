Here at Techbridge we are looking forward to Hour of Code the second time around. Some of our girls will get their first taste of coding in our after-school programs. Others will delve into more advanced projects and experiment with cutting-edge technologies, hacking clothes and electronics and experimenting with breadboarding and circuit design.
Last year our staff got involved too. We worked our way through the Hour of Code's tutorial at a team party. Personally, I struggled through the first few steps in the tutorial. I eventually felt a sense of accomplishment that our girls experience when they work through a tech challenge. As I worked at my own pace, I noticed who picked up coding quickly and found myself comparing my progress to theirs. For me it was a reminder of what kids experience as they learn new technologies. It's not just about the tech skills but also the confidence that you can learn the skills and that getting to the finish line first, isn't necessarily the ultimate goal.
