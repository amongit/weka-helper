As an observer of the Philippine tech scene, it's interesting to see how social media is reshaping the country's elections, particularly the campaign season for the coming mid-term polls this May.
While I am not exactly a voracious user of social media, one can readily notice its huge impact even before the campaign period began. Civil society has made great use of it through the "anti-epal" drive (or as it's described locally as a campaign against publicity-hungry or credit-grabbing politicians).
