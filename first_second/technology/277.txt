The humble taxi in India has received a makeover. In many Indian cities, including New Delhi, you can still call your neighbourhood taxi stand, where the half-asleep owner with whom you've had a telephonic relationship for years will remember you by name and address and make sure that one of his loyal lieutenants (who you also know) will get to your house within five or 10 minutes.
Often, there are no cabs available. Sometimes, the cabs just don't show up. But when they do, an Ambassador car the size of a tank and swathed in green, black, and yellow signalling its eco credentials (thanks to a CNG tank in the back) will lumber onto your street, give you two toots of its horn, and whisk you away to your destination while plying you with local gossip and a warm, familiar feeling called reassurance.
