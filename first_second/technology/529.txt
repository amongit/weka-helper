Hungary's ruling party has removed the controversial 'internet tax' from its proposed budget, the country's prime minister Viktor Orban said this morning on national radio.
The ruling Fidesz party last week proposed an extension to the country's telecom laws whereby ISPs would be forced to pay a levy based on the number of gigabytes of traffic travelling over their network. After protests over the weekend, the plans were watered down by adding a cap per customer: 700 forints (€2.27) per individual customer per month, and 5,000 forints (€16.20) for businesses.
