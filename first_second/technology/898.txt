Much of Linux's early business success was based on the Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python/PHP/Perl (LAMP) stack. Looking ahead Red Hat and Docker is hoping that "RHELDoc," a software stack made up of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Docker containers, can do for the cloud and data center what LAMP did for servers.
The two are doing this by launching one of the first certified, end­-to-­end ecosystem programs for Linux containers based on Docker. This follows up on Red Hat's earlier announcement in March of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Atomic Host (RHELAH). This program integrated RHEL and Docker.
