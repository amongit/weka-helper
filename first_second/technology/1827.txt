I get pleasure from helping people when I am in a position to do so. I’m a customer advocate when it comes to CRM-related stuff. So you would think that I love hearing the catchphrase “It’s all about the people” or other permutations that say it’s really the people that make all the difference.
Well, I don’t. I don’t because it’s not true, especially when you’re dealing with businesses. There's a lot more involved than just friendly faces, pleasant demeanors and kind voices.
