A little over two years ago, I was given the opportunity to write about Big Data for ZDNet. I was, and am, quite proud of that achievement. I've worked since that time to educate myself about this burgeoning part of the database and analytics scene, and to share what I learned with readers here. I've also tried to accompany reported facts with some opinion and analysis.
Kids these daysWhen I got here, I knew a lot about Business Intelligence (BI), but not so much about Big Data itself. I suspected the two were separated only arbitrarily, and over the two year period, I've confirmed that suspicion. Meanwhile, Big Data was (and still is) mostly about Hadoop. And Hadoop had its own separate ecosystem of tools, vendors and practitioners.
