It all started in 2005, when Computer Associates spun off its Ingres product (itself an acquisition) into the standalone Ingres Corporation. In 2010, Ingres acquired Vectorwise, the company behind the follow-on to the groundbreaking MonetDB project. After being 100% acquired by Garnett & Helfrich Capital in 2011, Ingres Corporation was renamed Actian Corporation. Ingres then acquired object database vendor Versant in 2012, and acquired Pervasive Software and ParAccel -- within weeks of each other -- in 2013.
There's a lot of important database history and technology under the Actian roof. On the flip-side, there's a bunch of different technology and branding, with the Actian name itself having thus far referred to a holding entity, in practical terms.
