Apple has described iOS 8, now available as a free download, as "the biggest release since the launch of the App Store" back in July 2008. Key new end-user features include improved Messages and Photos functionality, predictive typing for Apple's QuickType keyboard (and third-party keyboard support), Family Sharing (for iTunes, iBooks and App Store purchases), the Health app and iCloud Drive for easy access to stored content and enhanced collaboration.
iOS 8 is also a big release for developers, thanks to a multitude of new features â€” including the HealthKit and HomeKit frameworks, app extensions, in-app TouchID authentication, Handoff (which enables a user to begin an activity on one device and continue on another within wireless range), Metal (a new hardware-accelerated graphics API) and CloudKit (which handles server-side application logic). Apple has also introduced a new Objective-C-based programming language, Swift, for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.
