I've been on a bit of a digital social sabbatical for the last couple of months (to the extent we're able to tune out these days). I've always found it valuable to have regular hiatuses from anything that turns into habit and becomes part of the fabric of life — when I return to my previously habitual digital behaviors they often seem very different.
Last century, pre-broadband, for example, I was able to take vacations and get completely away from monitors and keyboards — I can remember coming back to my desk and thinking how quaint Mac OS X 9 was having not seen it after a couple of weeks of travel.
