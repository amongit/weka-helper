After a fortnight in which around 120 pages of evidence has emerged suggesting that NBN Co has succeeded in reducing the cost of fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) installs, it defies belief that Australian Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull would nonetheless stand in front of the Corporate Turnaround Conference and claim that no such savings has been achieved.
"There is no evidence FttP or fixed-wireless costs per premise are declining," Turnbull said in a speech dated September 18, apparently choosing to ignore the revelation that implementation of the Labor-era "Project Fox" — a process-improvement program stewarded by former CEO Mike Quigley and enthusiastically embraced by current CEO Bill Morrow — had been reported to have reduced the average cost of a fibre install by around AU$315.
