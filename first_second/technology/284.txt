Several days ago, the big buzz hogging the news feeds was Micromax's controversial besting of Samsung for the coveted number one spot in smartphone sales in India. But the real, unheralded sleeper hit amongst Indian smartphone makers could very well be Lava.
In recent days, Lava has unveiled a few phones in different segments of the market that have made both consumers and reviewers sit up and take notice: It unveiled one in the premium-budget segment, the Lava Iris Pro 30, priced at Rs 15,990 ($256); another in the budget-plus segment, the Lava Iris Fuel 60, at Rs 8,888 ($142); as well as one each in the budget (Iris Alfa, Rs 6,550, $105) and super-budget (Iris 465, Rs 4,499, $73) categories. This is quite a feat, and could be a significant one for the brand as it seeks climb up the rankings. Of devices sold in the previous quarter, 41 percent were priced between Rs 6,000 and Rs 12,000, while another 23 percent were represented by phones selling at less than $100 (Rs 6,200).
