Friends Reunited, the 12-year-old UK-based social network, was relaunched on Tuesday.
The site was bought in 2009 from broadcaster ITV by Brightsolid, part of Scottish newspaper publishing group DC Thompson, for £25 million. ITV had previously bought the company for £175 million in 2005, when Friends Reunited claimed some 15 million registered users. Currently, around 1.5 million users visit the site monthly.
