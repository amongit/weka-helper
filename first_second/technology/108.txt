The Hong Kong government recently announced another round of public consultation to solicit feedback for its Digital 21 plan â€” its digital master plan first started in 1998 and now in its fifth iteration. If there's something the government here is good for, it has to be public consultations, and you'd kind of think that it would get better at these, right?
But if you click over to the Digital 21 website, you will find towards the bottom of the page a very enthusiastic "Send us your views!" section (just below a very massive 130-page report (PDF) from IBM China), listing the email address, snail mail address, and a fax number for the consultation of a Digital 21 strategy. Perhaps it's someone's idea of sarcasm, or there may be a side bet somewhere to see whether there truly will be a faxed response.
