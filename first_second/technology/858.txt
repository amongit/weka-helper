Intercede has launched a cloud-based MyTAM service that will enable secure applications to run on Android phones that support trusted environments. MyTAM (My Trusted Application Manager) is aimed at financial services and payment applications, including Bitcoin. It could also be important in corporate environments, especially where BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) is the norm. And it's not just for data access: MyTAM enables secure voice calls over the internet with end-to-end encryption.
Intercede is an established provider of identity solutions. Its MyID is used by both the UK and US governments, by the UK's National Health Service, America's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Kuwait's national identity card, among other things.
