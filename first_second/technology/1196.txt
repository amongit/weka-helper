In 2011, First State Super (FSS) and its handling of information security professional Patrick Webster became the textbook case of how to be a jerk. In short, after Webster informed FSS of a vulnerability in its system, it thanked him, then sent the police to his door to pick him up.
Legal action against Webster was later dropped, and the Australian Privacy Commissioner's own investigation found that FSS had breached the Privacy Act , but it still send a pretty strong message to white hats: Don't seek out trouble.
