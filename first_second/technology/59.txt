Over the years, I have been involved with several global deployments of new technologies. The single common element I can identify among them is a stark disconnect between the field requirements perceived by corporate headquarters and how the territories themselves see their priorities.

The enthusiasm from the branch office is often more reserved. The branch manager has a completely different vantage point, which comes with a distinct set of concerns.
