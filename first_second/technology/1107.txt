As of the last estimates, the number of mobile phone subscribers in the Philippines is expected to overtake its actual population of over 96 million people. Some estimates even peg the number to breach the 100-million mark by the end of the year.
This is not surprising considering that mobile phone uptake in the country has been on the upswing, due to key reasons including low price points of mobile devices, "unli" or bucket pricing of mobile phone plans, retail or prepaid services, and other appealing service packages.
