As Jack Clark highlights in his blog , Amazon's new Glacier service allows you to archive data to its datacentres for a measly $0.01 per GB per month. He also shows how it costs 10 times as much to use Glacier as it would if instead you used your own tape library, and other associated hardware and software.
Quantum supplied the figures for the cost of hardware rather than a service and, of course, Quantum has a large footprint in the tape library market.
