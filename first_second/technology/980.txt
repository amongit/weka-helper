Existing prepaid customers are twice as likely to migrate to a postpaid connection, while those using existing Internet packs are four times more likely, reports consultancy firm PwC in a report looking into the changing profiles of customers in India. This is optimistic news for telecom operators who want more postpaid subscribers, who give them five times more revenue than prepaid customers.
