HTC's new HTC One M9 will be available starting in mid-March. I was able to spend 24 hours with an early production unit this week and it looks like the M9 may top the M7 as my favorite smartphone.
While I liked the M8 for the most part, there were a couple areas I wanted to see improved. With the M9, HTC looks to have improved in these areas, primarily in way of the in-hand feel and camera capability. Battery life should also be increased while the internal specs are top notch.
