Every buyer believes the ideal situation is to have sufficient budget to purchase products and services from the best vendor in the market. In practice, though, employees of large organizations tend to select vendors based solely on the lowest price. Small businesses, on the other hand, tend to nominate vendors who are their friends.
However, we really should be deciding based on which vendor is the most appropriate for the job at the time. For instance, your business typically would specify its ICT requirements and a few vendors would then submit their proposed solution with the quoted prices. But you realize that you are not really able to "compare red apple to red apple" because each proposal is different from the other. These typically are a few considerations other than price.
