While feature phones currently outsell smart phones by around two to one in Indonesia, the growth in the Indonesia economy is set to change that. Two local players, Axioo and Polytron, are gearing up to carve out a share of the emerging Indonesian smart phone market, according to Detik.com.
Axioo, long known as a computer and peripheral maker, started manufacturing smartphones in its Sunter and Cakung plants last month. The companyâ€™s traditional business was assembly of imported parts into consumer notebooks and PCs. It has built a strong foothold outside Java and Sumatra islands, winning a significant market share in provinces with a large rural population.
