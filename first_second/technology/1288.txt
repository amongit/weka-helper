In the Android spec wars, a 1080p display is old technology, but I would argue that it hits the sweet spot.
When the HTC One M7 launched with a 4.7-inch 1080p display in 2013, 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution) was the highest resolution available. In 2014, LG was the first to launch a phone, the LG G3, with a 1,440 x 2,560 Quad HD display.
