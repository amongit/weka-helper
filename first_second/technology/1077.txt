Back in mid-2011, a bunch of American cyberguys -- sorry, a group of former and then-current US national security officials and analysts -- promoted the idea of creating a separate, new internet to improve security for critical services such as banking. Some even suggested creating a ".secure" top-level domain, accessible only if you had certified digital credentials and signed away all of your privacy rights.
The supporters of these ideas included former CIA director Michael Hayden, then-NSA director General Keith Alexander, and others attending a round table on cybersecurity at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.
