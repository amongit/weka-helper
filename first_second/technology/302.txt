16 September was a big day for the Estonian startup scene: GrabCAD, one of the most promising startups founded in Estonia in recent years, which has also been called 'Facebook for engineers' announced that it's going to be acquired by US 3D printing technology company Stratasys.
The value of the deal wasn't publicly disclosed, but according to reports, Stratasys paid around $100m for the company to outbid Adobe and Autodesk, which Forbes said have shown interest in the startup. GrabCAD last year formed a partnership with the latter to connect its AutoCAD 360 and Autodesk Fusion applications to GrabCAD's community and tools.
