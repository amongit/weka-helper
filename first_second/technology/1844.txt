A few years back, Sage Group acquired an upmarket product line called Adonix. It was promptly rebranded to Sage ERP X3 and has done fairly decent business in Europe. Its market awareness in North America has been limited, though.
Over the years, Iâ€™ve seen this product line shift a lot technically. Sage ERP X3 has gone from a traditional client server architecture to a materially re-platformed solution with a number of cloud components and cloud add-on apps. As it exists today, the product can be deployed on-premises and in a hosted (private) cloud manner. It may soon, I believe, possess multi-tenancy.
