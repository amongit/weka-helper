I recently read some striking information about the changing role of IT in the enterprise—the average annual IT budget, when adjusted for inflation, is less now than it was 10 years ago. Yet, 10 years ago we didn’t have smartphones or tablets. We also didn’t have enterprise-wide business mobility, or big data, or cloud computing. It’s no wonder datacenter managers are always getting hammered on costs and efficiency. I believe this situation will change. IT spending will have to loosen up if companies plan on remaining competitive in a digital world. However, for many IT managers, maximizing efficiency and controlling costs are still the big game in town.
Lately, I’ve talked a lot about how virtualization enables you to get more out of a finite set of datacenter resources. However, virtualization is only one important cloud computing strategy that works to control costs and improve performance. Another is task automation.
