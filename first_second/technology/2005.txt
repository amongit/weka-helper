Trying to evaluate something you don't understand, is like trying to describe something you haven't seen. The introduction of computers on a massive scale (think 1:1) has led many school systems to include a mandatory technology integration or technology literacy component to the evaluation process. This leaves principals and school administrators tasked with conducting teacher evaluations in a rapidly changing educational environment that can be unfamiliar if not altogether intimidating.
Including a technology component in the teacher evaluation process sounds like a great idea since we continue to spend huge amounts of money to provide educators and students with technology-rich schools. But, this approach only works if the person conducting the observation knows what to look for. Many principles are former teachers who taught during a time when educational technology included film strips and mimeograph machines. To be fair, things are changing so fast, that even those who are new to the position can find themselves out of touch from one year to the next.
