Innovation on the Internet is driving businesses to look for faster and more cost-effective ways to build applications. Node.js, a runtime environment and library for running applications written in JavaScript outside the browser, has emerged in the last few years and has really benefit from this necessity. One of the advantages is straightforward: if you combine Node.js with other client-side JavaScript libraries such as AngularJS, you can use only JavaScript to develop both the server and the client sides of your Web Application.
Thus, you'll probably need a smaller team of JavaScript developers to quickly take your idea from paper to an available product in the market. But Node.js is not just for startups. PayPal, Yahoo and Microsoft are examples of bigger companies that are actively and openly using Node.js in their infrastructures.
