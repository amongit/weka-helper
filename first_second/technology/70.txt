Some technology changes arrive gradually and predictably. You can foresee that a storage system is approaching its capacity limits, or that servers are approaching end-of-life, or that the datacenter is simply too small for next year’s workload. However, when there is an outage or spike in user activity, you don’t have the luxury of a long runway. It becomes necessary to make changes on-the-fly, even automatically in some cases, so that there is no human latency at all, and that is where workload mobility comes in.
Workload mobility, instrumental in managing gradual change, is absolutely critical for handling rapid change. Operating an efficient and highly available datacenter is not trivial, particularly when it involves complex, distributed applications. Fortunately, virtualization at the server, storage, and networking layers helps to create a layer of abstraction that greatly simplifies the task.
