Appirio's crowdsourced approach to software development -- now called [topcoder] -- has garnered planned of attention among organizations that simply don't have the time, resources or skills to get cloud projects or mobile apps or even Google Glass solutions created more quickly.
Over the past month, the cloud and systems integrator has made two noteworthy strategic moves to strengthen that community: first, it has acquired Coderbits, the creator of a developer profiling system that helps showcase real-world skills; more recently, it has forged a relationship with Applause to bring testing capabilities to the [topcoder] community.
