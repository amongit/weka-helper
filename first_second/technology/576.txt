Google has turned Google Maps into a field service management tool with the introduction of an enterprise feature called Coordinate.
Google Maps Coordinate, introduced on Thursday, includes web and Android apps that let mobile workers disclose their co-ordinates to their colleagues and employers, and that give dispatchers a way to create teams and manage jobs.
