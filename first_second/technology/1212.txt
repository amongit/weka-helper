Domain name squatting could become more than an inconvenience due to an oversight on how internal site certificates can be used on generic top level domains (gTLDs) without necessarily being the owner of the gTLD.
As discussed in an advisory (PDF) issued by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN) Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) on Friday, a common practice by certificate authorities (CAs) is to issue digital certificates, even when the organisation requesting them provides a non-fully qualified domain name.
