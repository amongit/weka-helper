An article on the Harvard Business Review site presents a limited, shortsighted perspective on the business value of social media and makes incorrect recommendations to readers. The author suggests social media is a waste of resources when the opposite is true.
The article's title asks, "Is Social Media Actually Helping Your Company's Bottom Line?" and offers a graphic, saying #NOPE, in response. It's a great social media tactic that will certainly capture page views.
