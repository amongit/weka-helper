This has not been Lenovo's finest hour. First, security experts found that Lenovo was shipping Superfish adware, which turned out to have malware potential. Then, the company completely mishandled the news about it, simultaneously declaring it to be both a security concern and not one. Spoiler alert: Superfish was a major security foul-up. Now, the Lenovo website has been hacked.
The site's Domain Name System (DNS) record was cracked at about 4PM Eastern time. As of 6:30 PM Eastern time, the site was still down, but it's coming back as the DNS records are restored. If you go to Lenovo.com now you may still find, instead of computers to buy, a slide-show of several young people while the song "Breaking Free" from High School Musical plays in the background.
