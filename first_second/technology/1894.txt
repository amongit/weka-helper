I must say, filling up my 20 gallon gas tank for $35 instead of $65 feels kind of nice. I know I'm not alone in feeling the price ease -- Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have been inundated with #GasPrices photos.
Regardless of the gas price burden being lifted, the economist in me is going crazy. Low gas prices could result in some unintended and painful consequences. My advice? Be optimistically cautious.
