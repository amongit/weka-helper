BOSTON - At the Linux Foundation's new Vault show, it's all about file systems and storage. You might think that there's nothing new to say about either topic, but you'd be wrong.
Storage technology has come a long way from the days of, as Linus Torvalds put it, "nasty platters of spinning rust" and Linux has had to keep up. In recent years, for example, flash memory has arrived as enterprise server primary storage and persistent memory is bringing us storage that works at DRAM speeds. At the same time, Big Data, cloud computing, and containers are all bringing new use cases to Linux.
