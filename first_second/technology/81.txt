Vebbler is a new personal network that allows people to have more meaningful conversations with different relationships in their lives without one aspect of their life spilling into another. Founded by a 23-year-old Sahil Bhagat, the service has raked in over 10,000 users in few weeks since it was launched in beta.
According to Sahil, Facebook and other platforms are designed on the "social networking" model, an open platform to connect with a large group of people and acquaintances. An average person has between 1,000 and 1,500 friends, of which only 200 or so may be real and intimate connections. Vebbler believes that the quality of relationships is more important than the quantity of relationships. The service therefore allows a maximum of 500 connections, although a user can follow as many people as he finds interesting.
