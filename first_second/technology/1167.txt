In case you missed it, Google CEO Sergey Brin publicly admitted last week that Google+ was "a mistake" for him â€” one month after the man he hired to run the social network, Vic Gundotra, left the company without explanation.
Brin told the audience at boutique Bay Area tech conference Recode that he was "kind of a weirdo" and that, "it was probably a mistake for me to be working on anything tangentially related to social to begin with."
