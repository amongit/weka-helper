Tanglu GNU/Linux is a distribution based on Debian Testing. When I wrote recently about the future of Linux Mint Debian Edition and other distributions based on Debian Testing, what I was concerned about was the fact that they will be changing their base to Debian Stable in the near future. Tanglu has not given any indication that they intend to change, so this could be a good alternative for the future.
Their new release is available from the Tanglu downloads page in three versions, built with either the KDE Plasma or Gnome 3 desktop or a Core distribution with no GUI. Oh, and it also mentions that there is a Docker image of Tanglu available. The GUI versions are about 1.3GB each, while the Core distribution is only about 550MB. All three are hybrid-ISO images which can be copied (dd) directly to a USB stick to create bootable Live USB media, or of course can be burned to DVD (or CD for the Core version).
