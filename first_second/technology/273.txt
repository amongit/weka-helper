South African doctors have a proud tradition of medical firsts. The first heart transplant took place here, CAT scans were invented here and so was the 'cryoprobe' â€” a frozen needle used in cataract surgery. When they're not first, they can be pretty close: two years ago, an infant with 80 percent burns received one of the first skin grafts using tissue grown from her own stem cells.
And last week a team of surgeons at the Kimberly Hospital in the Eastern Cape became only the second in the world to perform reconstructive facial surgery using 3D-printed jaw implants.
