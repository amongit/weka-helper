The hulking weight of the Mozilla suite was one of the original reasons the browser that eventually came to be known as Firefox was begun, but a decade later, the Mozilla browser is armed with an inbuilt integrated development environment (IDE) that surpasses the capability of the Mozilla Composer.
Currently released in Firefox's Nightly release stream, the IDE called WebIDE contains an editor for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files based upon the open source CodeMirror editor, as well as Firefox OS simulators.
