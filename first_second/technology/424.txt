It could have all been so different. While complaining about broadband availability and slow speed has become something of a national sport, there was once a plan that could have catapulted the UK to the front of the broadband speed stakes. So what happened? How did the UK shift from the broadband fast lane to the slow?
If you look at Ofcom’s broadband map of the UK (which you will find here) it shows that broadband coverage is a patchwork. The coverage is only reckoned to be first rate in a corridor that runs from London via Birmingham to Liverpool, (this corridor is rated 'One', the best) why is it reckoned to be pretty poor in Rutland ('Four' with 'Five' being the worst), when Rutland is tight in the middle of the corridor? Why is Wales given a rating as bad as the worst (Five) over half its area? Is it simply because of the hills? But if hills give Wales a Five rating why do the Yorkshire Dales – good hilly ground - have a rating of Two, second highest?
