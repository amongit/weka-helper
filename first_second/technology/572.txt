Samsung has pushed to poach iPhone users in the UK by offering them a free iOS-to-Android content-transfer tool.
The Korean manufacturer said on Friday that it would be offering anyone buying a Galaxy device in the country a copy of Easy Phone Sync, through an exclusive licensing deal with developer Media Mushroom. The tool lets users transfer iPhone and iTunes contacts, text messages, audio and video to devices such as the Galaxy S III.
