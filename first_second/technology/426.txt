I've written about Apple's habit of retiring gadgets while I'm still cheerfully using them before, and the iPod Classic is the latest to get discontinued, seven years after it was first launched.
It took me long enough to get over my original iPad reaching the end of the line, stranded forever at iOS 5.1.1. Oh yes, I still have the iPad in question and despite the fact that the software is all out of date it still works just fine.
