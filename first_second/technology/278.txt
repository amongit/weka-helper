Something weird happened in the hottest smartphone market in the world last quarter. Not just weird, but downright alarming. According to research outfit IDC, smartphone shipments actually fell by 11 percent over Q3, and were 5 percent lower than the same quarter the previous year. This was amidst all the frenzied internet sales of seemingly unending hot products from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi producing the kind of froth that India hasn't perhaps seen in the market for any consumer product.
Luckily for phone buyers, the drop is explainable -- a result of high inventory that retailers tend to take in right before the big festival-holiday consumer madness that occurs right before Diwali -- and highlights the peculiarities of selling in a market like India. Online sales apparently didn't help any, contributing to the drop. Smartphones make up 35 percent of phones sold in India, the rest being feature phones. However, feature phone growth rates continue to plummet.
