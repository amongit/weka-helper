The truly sad thing about a webinar on Wednesday featuring Forrester Research security and risk analyst Heidi Shey — apart from it being called a "webinar", ugh! — was its depressing familiarity. Businesses keep making the same information security mistakes over and over again. That needs to stop.
Shey ran through the lessons we could learn from five of the biggest data breaches in the last year or so — eBay, Korean Credit Bureau, Adobe, the New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University duo, and Target.
