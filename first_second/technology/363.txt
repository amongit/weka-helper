Explaining CES in advance, Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Electronics Association, noted that the show is whatever the CEA wants it to be. As the interest in big TVs waned, CES added phone accessories and cars and startups and wearables and appliances - and a whole range of other things that contain electronics and are bought by consumers.
But CES isn't just what the CEA wants it to be; it's also what commentators want it to be. If they're missing Apple products - Apple doesn't attend because it doesn't show products at anyone else's event - they can still point to dozens of companies with phone cases and tablet cases and hardware accessories - from Olloclip's iPhone 6 camera lens that improves the front camera as well this time, to the Smarter coffee maker that you can drive from an iPhone app, to TYLT's ever-impressive range of external batteries and stay flat cables.
