A recent report from the University of Pennsylvania's Alliance for Higher Education and Democracy and the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education reveals a disturbing and widening gap in college completion rates between the nation's rich and poor students. While the percentage of high-income students earning college degrees by age 24 nearly doubled from 1970 to 2013, the percentage of low-income students earning college degrees during the same period remained virtually flat. Even more disturbing, while the number of low-income students registering for college increased during the period studied, only 20 percent of them actually were able to complete their bachelor's degree by age 24. The study comes amid President Obama's proposal to provide free community college to all, which will be an essential step towards enabling more students -- regardless of background -- to earn a college degree.
The U.S. made high school mandatory after World War II, and the impact of that policy resulted in America's greatest sustained period of economic growth. Enabling all of our young people to bridge the gap between high school and the academic and workplace skills they need to participate in the global economy -- without burdening them with crushing debt -- is a no brainer. Community college is the new high school now. It's essential that as many barriers as possible are removed and increased attendance enabled. But for this to work, we must focus on completion. We need partnerships among high schools, colleges and employers to help improve the rigor and relevance of what we teach. Funding to make college free is important, but we also need to ensure that funding focuses on improving college completion and links to well-paying jobs.
