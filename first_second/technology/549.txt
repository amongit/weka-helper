Community clouds are shared infrastructures used by several organisations that have the same concerns such as mission, security, policy and compliance requirements. They’re a relatively new concept and can be very useful for organisations that have a shared set of objectives, whether it’s companies in an industry or departments within a government organisation.
What’s interesting is that community clouds, as new as they are, tend to be less concerned about technology infrastructures and more about the common objectives. That in itself tells you how far cloud technologies have developed and how widespread is the acceptance of the cloud.
