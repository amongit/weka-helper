Hold on to your hats, Traditionalists and Baby Boomers: Generation X is 50 years old.
Yes, I know that there are many different definitions of the beginning and ending years of Gen X, and it is roughly early/mid 60's to early/mid 80's. I've also seen Baby Boomers described as ending in 1964. For this reason, I chose Late Boom, Early X as my "micro-bio."
