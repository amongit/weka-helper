Australia this week has signed onto two new free-trade agreements, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott visiting Japan and Korea to sign the agreements over the last few days. As Abbott attempts to forge a similar agreement with Australia's largest trading partner China, Australian negotiators continue to work in the background on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which could have much larger ramifications for Australian intellectual property laws.
The Trans-Pacific Partnertship (TPP) agreement is a currently being negotiated between Australia, the US, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, aimed at simplifying trade between the 12 nations.
