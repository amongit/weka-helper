Stuck in the middle of an interminable recession, with the third consecutive year of shrinking GDP and rising unemployment (the latest official figures were at 13 percent overall and 44 percent among the country's young people), Italy is looking at new ways to revitalize its struggling economy.
Last June, the Italian government launched its Startup Visa program, a special permit reserved for entrepreneurs coming from outside the eurozone with innovative business ideas. In December, it extended the program to foreign students who have received a degree in Italy and want to stay in the country to start a business.
