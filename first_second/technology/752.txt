A long time ago, we funded a Kickstarter. Just over a year, to be exact. Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas decided in 2013 that he would use Kickstarter to get what the film studios had for so long denied to offer him: Funding for a movie.
It was easily one of the most successful crowdfunding schemes last year, with 91,585 backers putting in for a total of $5.7 million.
