The Open Data Center Alliance (ODCA) was formed in 2010. It had several objectives: identify customer requirements for cloud adoption; define usage models; influence industry innovation: and collaborate with industry standards organisations.
One year later it has over 300 members, representing over $100 billion in annual IT spend; eight published usage models; the first industry paper on best practice for cloud application development and resiliency; and collaborations with leading standard bodies including the Cloud Security Alliance, the Open Compute Project, the Green Grid and the Distributed Management Task Force.
