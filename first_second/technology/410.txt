Time was when a network-attached storage (NAS) box was pretty much that: just storage. But those times have changed, and you can now buy a NAS that offers features that were enterprise-level not that long ago. But do they work properly?
As well as offering shares for Windows and Mac (CIFS and AFP) today's NAS systems can now be found offering thin provisioning, deduplication, replication and snapshotting. If you include systems such as FreeNAS, which is based on Sun's ZFS, it even offers all that for free -- although you will of course need a hardware platform if you don't already happen to have hanging around a VMware ESXi server with a couple of gigs of memory to spare.
