Indians may have become used to seeing home-grown brands thrive in overseas markets in the past decade or so. Mahindra and Tata trucks are sold all over Africa and Latin America; Apollo's tyres outfit Europe's best cars; and Jaguar and Land Rover, once icons of British manufacturing, are now produced by the Tatas but are still selling like gangbusters.
Yet, the image of Indians triumphantly hawking home-grown phones abroad doesn't seem so believable, and there's a reason for it. We may have churned out legions of world-class engineers, software companies, and tech entrepreneurs, but for a variety of reasons -- the irrational inverted duty structure is an oft-cited one -- electronics manufacturing has been a dismal failure in the last few decades. And so, Indians have been hardwired into thinking that when it comes to the realm of televisions, computers, and phones, it is foolish to think that we could compete with the Chinese or the Koreans.
