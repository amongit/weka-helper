It's been mildly amusing to see, once more, a vendor of two-factor authentication call the end of the line for passwords as a security mechanism. We've been around this particular block so many times in the last 20 years that I've lost count.
The latest contributor to this never-ending debate is Steve Watts, co-founder of the tokenless two-factor authentication vendor SecurEnvoy. According to the company's latest press release: "Commenting on reports that a security developer has concluded that password-creation policies are the enemy of secure passwords, SecurEnvoy says that the fundamental issue is that conventional ID/password security is now coming to the end of the line as far as security is concerned."
