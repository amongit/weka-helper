Being an early stage startup isn't always easy in India, considering the native ecosystem, loads of learning for entrepreneurs, and the evolving market. Many entrepreneurs may aspire to solve a complicated problem, but will not easily get backing in terms of the right guidance, funding, and mentoring.
That's what the managing partners at Blume Ventures, an angel and seed fund venture based in Mumbai, are hoping to change. With quite a bit of experience in Silicon Valley during its early days around 1999-2001, they bring their knowledge to help startups in India succeed right from the get go.
