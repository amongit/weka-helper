This week I'm deep in the heart of the Javits Center for the 2015 Retail Big Show, running between meetings and navigating the ever growing maze of companies. Every year I go into these meetings wondering what the "big theme" will be for the show. In the past we have had Big Data, omni-channel retail, store level replenishment, eCommerce to name a few.
