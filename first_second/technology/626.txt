I say this a lot, but I hate buzzwordsâ€”technology ones and otherwise. Every discipline has its three-letter acronyms (TLAs) and its own jargon, but technology attracts more than its share. I understand buzzwords, but when they're used so frequently that I can't follow what's being said, there's something to fear about the message and the messenger. My goal in this post is to help you learn the buzzwords, to help you discover their true meanings, to help you discern the real from the fake, and to help you avoid those entities who use them too often.
The terms are in no particular order.
