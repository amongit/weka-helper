I always have a love/hate with the first official working day of the year. It always seems like we all start our long bear nap right around Halloween and are distracted by the holidays and silly season until after New Year's Day.
But once the holiday break comes to an end, it's like we all wake up together, right around 9am on the first working day of the year.
