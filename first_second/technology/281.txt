The news of late surrounding Samsung has overwhelmingly been about how it's getting its lunch eaten by domestic rival Micromax, according to research firm Canalysis, something that the Korean major has strongly contested. Canalysis maintained that Micromax was responsible for 22 percent of smartphone sales in India in the October-December quarter, versus Samsung's 20 percent. Samsung, on the other hand, insists that it had a leading volume market share of 34.3 percent.
Whichever way you slice it, the fact is that Samsung has been steadily losing market share points in India as domestic phone makers such as Lava and Karbonn in addition to foreign ones such as Xiaomi and Motorola have flooded the market with their affordable phones. Meanwhile, Samsung has mystifyingly avoided the hottest-growing category, seemingly focused on its premium line-up. This is a strategic mistake, according to some, considering that 25 percent of smartphones sold in India in the fourth quarter were priced under $100, while 41 percent were in the $100 to $200 range.
