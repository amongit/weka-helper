Indian authorities may soon issue a public advisory against the potential risks associated with transaction using the digital virtual currency Bitcoin, reports The Times of India. The biggest worry for all of those involved is currently focused on the obvious, money laundering. As Bitcoin is traded on only a handful of global exchanges across the world, clearly there are risks involved, in addition to the instability of the value of Bitcoin. Within the past week, Bitcoin has spiked between US$800 to past US$1,200. As such, pressure has increased on regulatory and enforcement agencies in India to issue a warning regarding Bitcoin, following recent similar moves both in China and France.
Within India, digital currency is not regulated as rules haven't even been drawn up in regards to which jurisdiction regulation would fall under. In the US, all prevailing laws regarding money laundering already apply to Bitcoin, while in China, banks and other financial institutions have been asked not to deal in Bitcoins.
