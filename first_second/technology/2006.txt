Forget the device. Focus on web-based applications that best meet the needs of your students and teachers. If your solution requires a specific piece of hardware, it's not a practical long-term solution. Things are changing quickly in the educational technology world, and if you're working with vendors that aren't flexible in terms of platform, device, and screen size, well.. your working with the wrong vendors.
In recent months, I've worked with several school districts that are implementing 1:1 Chromebook programs. The weird thing is, none of them included Chromebooks for teachers. The teachers are using more expensive laptops like the MacBook, while students are using Chromebooks. In fact, one district spent nearly the same amount of money on 200 staff devices as they did on 800 student devices. Like concerned school board members, you may be asking yourself why.
