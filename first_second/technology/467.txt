It's been a terrible winter in my home town of New York City â€” and I'd rather be in California, where O'Reilly's Strata conference kicks off today.
As it happens though, I'm somewhere better still: Dorado, Puerto Rico on a family vacation. That notwithstanding, there's a ton of Big Data news today, in conjunction with Strata, so I felt compelled to roll up the announcements in a single post.
