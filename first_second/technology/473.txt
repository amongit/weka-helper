My recent post, Predicting Big Data's 2014 , presented an analysis of year 2014 Big Data predictions from four different vendors. It provided enough food for thought, it seems, that several other industry players saw fit to get into the game. In fact, after that post was published, I received more than double the number of prediction slates than I had for that first go-round.
When a larger sampling comes into view, we end up having a better data set, and our analysis can be a bit stronger (very meta, eh?). And with this broader set of predictions, we encounter a few themes that recur quite frequently.
