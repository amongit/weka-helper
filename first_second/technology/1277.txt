Back in November I wrote about my disappointment with Microsoft's non-existent high end Windows Phone lineup. Until the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft looks to be focused on the 'affordable flagship' and I thought that was a serious problem.
A few weeks ago, I decided to buy a Nokia Lumia 830, check out the ZDNet review, to see if there was any reason for a consumer to consider a mid-range device. It turns out I was wrong about the affordable flagship and you really can get by with a phone like the Lumia 830, at about half the price of an iPhone 6.
