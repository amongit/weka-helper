Patient status updates at a hospital's accidents and emergency (A&E) department, consolidated medical records from other hospitals and outpatient clinics, and ward visitor self-registration kiosks. These are a few of my favorite "things" at Singapore's hospitals.
Hospitals are not places for impressing locals and tourists. While there are still many ICT-related improvements that can still be put in, and being high tech does not reflect the standard of medical care, it is still good to see ICT being used meaningfully in local hospitals.
