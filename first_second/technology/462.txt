As reported earlier today by my ZDNet colleague Mary Jo Foley , Microsoft SQL Server 2014 has been released to manufacturing, and will be generally available on April 1st.
Quentin Clark, Corporate Vice President in charge of Microsoft's Data Platform Group, detailed the release in a blog post today, which went live at 9am Pacific Time. Just prior to the publishing of that post, I interviewed Clark, and learned a few important things about this release.
