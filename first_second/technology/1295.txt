Google has stopped selling the Nexus 5 online. This is not surprising since the newer Nexus 6 has been selling for a while. It was reported late last year that production had stopped on the older Nexus.
There is still inventory in the channel so it may be possible to pick up a highly discounted Nexus 5.
