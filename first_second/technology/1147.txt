Dell, once the quintessential 'box-shifter', has in recent years followed the industry trend towards (to borrow a phrase) a devices-and-services model in pursuit of continued profit, as margins on mainstream hardware shrink to wafer-thin levels. Hardware doesn't come much more mainstream than the business desktop PC, and to differentiate its offerings from the competition Dell now offers a bundle of security solutions under the Dell Data Protection (DDP) banner. Executives from the company were in London this week to announce a new addition to the DDP portfolio, show off a couple of recently launched OptiPlex all-in-one PCs, and discuss the latest desktop virtualisation offerings from Wyse (a Dell company).
Dell's latest all-in-one (AIO) business desktops are the 19.5-inch OptiPlex 3030 (from £439 ex. VAT/$799) and the 23-inch OptiPlex 9030 (from £689 ex. VAT/$899), both optionally available with touchscreens and discrete GPUs.
