Sixty years after his tragic death, the brilliant English mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) has come back to life, if only virtually, in the new movie The Imitation Game.
The movie spotlights Turing's work as a codebreaker during World War II. That's a logical choice given his success in cracking a key German naval code known as Enigma.
