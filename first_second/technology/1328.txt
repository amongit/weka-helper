Apple unveiled its latest product category, the Apple Watch, and all indications are it will be another big seller. It covers the spectrum for a new product, from tech to fashion to luxury goods. Analysts have chimed in on how big the Apple Watch will be for the company, but the big winner might be the iPhone.
To use the Apple Watch requires an iPhone. The Watch pairs with the iPhone 5 or 6 models and becomes an additional screen for the handset and adds what is shaping up to be a lot of apps. At the Apple Watch launch event the company demonstrated capabilities it adds to the iPhone in tow, like making phone calls and performing text messaging.
