About 10 years ago a good friend, who I totally respected and who is publishing a book on his philosophy of living called "Presence Is Power" (love the title), told me that if I didn't get a computer there was no way I could keep up, understand, or live in this world of electronics. After a year of his encouragement, I gave in and bought an Apple desktop computer.
When I set it on my drafting table, it was quite impressive looking. Beyond looking so impressive to me, it was a completely mysterious object. Even the keyboard was a zero. I have never put a finger on a typewriter. To this day, every word I write has to be in long hand on a legal pad. Then transferred to this magical instrument. This is 10 years later and I can proudly email, send attachments and understand my own Facebook page, that my publicist puts together.
