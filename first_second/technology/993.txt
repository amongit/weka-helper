The toll-free number, 1037, will soon be set up for Indian mobile subscribers to file complaints against their Indian telecom operators, according to a report by The Times of India. Currently, subscribers need to call their respective customer care representatives and file a complaint, which in itself can be a cumbersome task, involving nodal officers and higher authorities in cases of unsatisfactory replies. Even then, it's more likely for subscribers not to get satisfactory resolutions of their grievances, and, as such, this toll-free number is now being set up across India.
To be specific, the toll-free number 1037 has been allocated to the Public Grievances cell with the Department of Telecom (DoT) headquarters in New Delhi as a telecom consumer grievances helpline. What remains to be seen is how seriously complaints filed will be taken and followed up with the Indian telecom operators.
