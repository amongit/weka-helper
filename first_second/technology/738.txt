For the past few months, as the Australian government attempts to make the case for forcing telecommunications companies to retain all customer data for two years, law-enforcement agencies have provided a whole number of anecdotal cases in which metadata -- the call records, IP addresses, and other similar communication information -- has been used to avert or solve a number of serious crimes and prevent terrorism.
It has tended to rely on anecdotal cases because, by and large, the police both federally and in each state have been unable to quantify exactly how many times metadata has been used to solve or prevent a crime.
