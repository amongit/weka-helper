One of the challenges of managing leads in sales for startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is to follow up with the leads they acquire, and effectively convert them into business opportunities. A lot of enterprises, startups, and SMEs use the available CRM tools and complex products, but it can be a task sometimes to keep track of and effectively manage the leads using those systems. And for many others, they may also not be cost effective.
This is where LeadSquared, a Bangalore-based startup, comes into the picture. LeadSquared offers basic and usable lead and task management features to avoid the challenges of using and implementing the complex CRM systems.
