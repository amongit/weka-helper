I wrote previously about how unprotected USB flash drives or portable hard disk drives (HDD) could lead to data loss if they were misplaced or stolen. Though free software encryption offerings exist, they can be unintuitive and offer users the option to skip the data encryption process when rushing for time.
This means that businesses serious about data protection will want to use storage devices with built-in hardware encryption, which unfortunately is still not commonly found on shop shelves in Singapore. As such, my interest was piqued when a unit of the Apricorn Aegis PadLock 3.0 with 256-bit AES encryption crossed my desk.
