Software development is not an easy business. Like a lot of technical jobs, people on the outside don't tend to appreciate what's involved. "Can't you just make it do blah-blah, " clients say, and then off we go as developers to try and make it happen.
Now and again, someone comes up with some amazing innovation that makes software developers lives genuinely easier. .NET is a good example -- any developer who worked with Microsoft technology back in the 1990s will remember how downright difficult working with anything other than Visual Basic was. Or jQuery -- a technology that in one single stroke made building web apps a hundred thousand times easier.
