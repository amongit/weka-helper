Dr. Alex Osterwalder is among the most influential proponents of business model innovation in the world. His first book, called Business Model Generation, sold a million copies in 30 languages and has had a profound influence on startups and entrepreneurial education. More recently, he wrote a book called Value Proposition Design , which explains how to gain greater fit between your product and the intended market.
Osterwalder's first book describes a tool called the Business Model Canvas , which summarizes the main components of a business plan on a single page. By linking the Business Model Canvas to ideas from Steve Blank around evidence-based entrepreneurship , Osterwalder provides a framework for startups and large companies to innovate by rapidly experimenting with new business models.
