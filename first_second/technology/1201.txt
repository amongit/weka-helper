If some guy walked into our office and offered started to write my articles for me, I'd be somewhat appreciative, if not worried for my job security. But if he then started asking the company for money, I'm pretty sure, and hopeful, that he'd be politely told to go through the regular channels and apply for a job.
Depending on how the industry is going, maybe my employer might keep him on as a freelancer, but given they have a paid-for resource (me!) they'll either thank him for his time and tell him to move along, or charge him some pitiful rate so as to make it worthwhile for the company.
