New pressure sensitive sensors in the latest Apple MacBook and Watch, which give devices the human-like ability to distinguish between a touch and tap, could be making its way to the next iPhone.
According to the Wall Street Journal, an Apple supplier says the company is considering adding Force Touch to the next iPhone as it works on a sequel to the record-breaking quarter that followed the release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
