I feel bad for the Southern California Edison (SCE) IT workers laid off in favor of the decision to use H-1B workers. Your fellow IT workers have felt your pain for more than ten years. It's kind of ironic that this is getting so much air time, because unfortunately for many hundreds of thousands of American workers, this is nothing new. I'm sorry for your plight, but I have to say, "Welcome to the club."
It sucks having to train your replacements doesn't it? It sucks that you're threatened that you'll be separated from the company with no severance package if you don't train your replacement. It sucks knowing that the American company that you work for, and have been faithful to, can just displace you without a thought because they believe that their plan is going to have a positive impact on the bottom line. It sucks that the brilliant decision-makers believe that what they're doing is right for the company and that they're really saving money. And it sucks that it's happening to you.
