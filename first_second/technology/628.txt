If you'd asked me five years ago what I thought of Dell, I'd have given you a much different answer than I would today.

Refreshing to see that a company can reboot itself as a major contender in the competitive world of enterprise computing. Scary that it has done so by hiring instead of having massive layoffs, investing rather than divesting, and buying in instead of selling off.
