Directi has launched an online programming platform, CodeChef for Schools, which is aimed at fostering developers at grass root level to create a self-sustaining community of technology developers.
The initiative hopes to enable Indian students to excel at the International Olympiad of Informatics (IOI), one of the five academic Olympiads for high-school students worldwide. The competition requires contestants to show basic IT skills such as as problem analysis, design of algorithms and data structures, programming, and testing.
