In today's educational landscape there are a lot of players vying for influence over the future of America's P-20 educational system. Of these players, none have been as influential as the "Billionaire Boys Club." To be in this club, you have to have a net worth of $1 billion dollars, and be a staunch advocate for P-20 education reform, whether through a foundation, or some other form of activism. I was impressed by the philanthropic acts of this group in 2014 and wanted to take a few minutes to highlight some of their biggest accomplishments this year.
