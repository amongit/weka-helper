The stones will cry out! It’s a nice phrase with a Biblical ring, understandably so as it occurs in both Old and New Testaments. Now it’s coming true in the visibly Biblical landscape of Afghanistan, as Lockheed Martin is promoting smart rocks that lie quietly for weeks until the time comes to relay intelligence about their environment.
The idea, the manufacturers and military customers explain, is that a network of sensors hidden in fake rocks can silently monitor the ground for evidence of passing vehicles, animals or people, and squirt any results over mesh networks until they reach a satellite uplink. Thousands of miles away, intelligence services can build up maps of activity over many months without needing any human operatives in the area.
