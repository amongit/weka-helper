The Dutch data protection authority, College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens (CBP), is threatening to fine Google for violating Dutch privacy rules.
According to CBP, Google's terms of service on privacy, which were altered in 2012, are in violation of the Dutch Data Protection Act (known as the WPB). The regulator says that Google combines user data from various Google services in order to display personalised ads, without the user's consent. It's now threatening Google with a â‚¬15m fine unless it makes changes to the policy.
