More enterprises are expected to look to hybrid cloud in the new year to gain some control of their infrastructure while tapping into the benefits that cloud has to offer. However, many still do not have a proper strategy in place, and the lack of a definition for what a hybrid cloud actually means isn't helping, either.
Businesses typically begin their cloud journey with private cloud, because they have no experience in running a public cloud service, or have limited knowledge about the platform. However, this will not allow organizations to reap the full benefits of running a cloud infrastructure, noted Eric Hui, Asia-Pacific director of cloud and service provider markets, Equinix.
