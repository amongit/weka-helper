Google has stopped selling the Nexus 5 smartphone in its hardware shop.
Google began selling the LG-made Nexus 5 in 2014 through its own online channels. Now that seems to have come to an end: the Nexus 5 page on the Google Store website says it's "no longer available for purchase" and the buy button is now greyed out with text reading "not available".
