Around 1,000 NatWest branches opened early on Friday morning, to serve customers affected by a continued glitch in the bank's systems.
The fault manifested itself late on Wednesday, stopping customers' balances from updating properly and holding up direct debits. RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank are all affected by the problem, although they have insisted that no customer would permanently lose money as a result.
