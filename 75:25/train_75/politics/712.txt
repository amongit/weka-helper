Few Depressed Americans Seek Care
Just over a third of people who have severe depression report having contact with a mental health professional during the past year, even though medication and therapy is known to be the most effective treatment against the condition, a new government report shows.
Released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the report looked at depression rates from 2009 to 2012, finding that percentages of treatment remain low, and that the treatment received often is inadequate. In collecting data, depressive symptoms were evaluated as lasting more than two weeks. According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 20 million people in the United States have depression. Its symptoms go beyond feeling sad for a few days, and interfere with people's daily lives, causing energy loss, feelings of worthlessness, problems with sleeping, or thoughts of death or suicide. It is considered a disorder of the brain that is due to a variety of causes, whether genetic, environmental, psychological or biochemical.

The report showed that nearly 90 percent of people with severe depression report difficulty with work, home, or social activities because of their symptoms. Still, the majority do not seek mental health treatment. The report did not elaborate on potential causes for why people avoid treatment, and did not collect data on whether people seek care less often if they are below the poverty level.
The CDC findings reveal also that depression can vary by age, gender, race and poverty level. It also is associated with higher rates of other chronic disease, use of other health care services, and impaired functioning, according to the report. Some other key findings:
