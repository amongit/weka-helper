Obama Should Have Gone to Paris
The eyes of the world remain focused on Paris, where terrorist activities have cast a long and dark shadow over life in the City of Light.
It is reassuring that world leaders could come together as they did over the weekend to join arms in solidarity against the human monsters behind the senseless attacks that left far too many dead. They came not just to promote peace but to stand resilient in the name of liberty. And it is most unfortunate that U.S. President Barack Obama could not find the time to join them.

The world once looked to America not just as the “arsenal of democracy” but as the “citadel of freedom,” the place where all people had the right to be considered one another’s equal. To these shores the “homeless, tempest tossed” have come for three centuries seeking a better life.
Under Obama, the shine has come off that promise. His feckless foreign policy has been weak toward terror and weak toward the oppressive Islamic theocracies that export terror and crush the life and breath out of the people forced to live under their dictates. His failure to attend the march in Paris might be explainable; his failure to find someone of status and comparatively equal in rank to the other world dignitaries in attendance is not.
American should have been there, in force. We lead the world in so many ways, the defense of freedom not the least among them. The Paris march was an important event, an important statement that the civilized peoples of the world will not be bloodied, beaten and bullied into submission by savages who care not what lives they may take while pursuing their misguided objectives.
Perhaps the president believes somehow that this is not America’s fight. Perhaps he believes the Europeans are now, in some way, reaping what their centuries of colonization and oppression had sown in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. His thinking on these matters is not transparent. The Israeli prime minister and the German chancellor found time to link arms with the president of France in a march for peace; how is it Obama, for whom symbolism has done so much as he has risen ever higher in the American political system, could not see the symbolic need to have the United States there as well?

We who count ourselves among the civilized must confront terror if we are to confound it. There are ways to isolate the fanatic fringe to lessen their impact, all of which require patience, a genuine effort at developing a deeper understanding, and a measured response that seeks out the evil doers, rather than an entire group of people. The latter approach, as the Germans, the French and the Jews of both Europe and Israel well know, never ends well. With the stakes as high as these, how can America stand on the sidelines, hoping the world will simply go by, leaving us to lead our lives unnoticed by those who would do violence against us?
The president’s failure to go to France, or to dispatch Vice President Joe Biden or former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, is not the greatest mistake of his presidency; in many ways, however, it may be the most profound because of what it says about what he thinks is important and deserving of his attention.
