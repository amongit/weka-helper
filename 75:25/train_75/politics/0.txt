James Carville does Hillary Clinton no favors with his defense of her e-mails
James Carville did his best Sunday to downplay the whole controversy over Hillary Clinton's e-mails. He didn't do very well. In the context of arguing that 1) People don't care much about it, and 2) It's just the latest attack from Clinton's enemies, the former Clinton adviser also offered this not-so-helpful quip. "I suspect she didn't want Louie Gohmert rifling through her e-mails, which seems to me to be a kind of reasonable position for someone to take," Carville said. "Just like everything else before it, it amounts to nothing but a bunch of people flapping their jaws about nothing." For those unfamiliar, Gohmert is an outspoken conservative member of Congress who often jousts with Democrats. But he's also a member of Congress, which is precisely the body that Republicans are accusing Clinton of trying to avoid with her "homebrew" e-mail server. Clinton has said using the homebrew account was a matter of convenience rather than an attempt to subvert oversight. Carville apparently didn't get the memo.
