Michigan public records laws lag behind most other states
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan’s public records law allows anyone to request information that can help shine a light on what government is doing, but not all of government is subject to those disclosure requirements.
Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act does not cover the governor, lieutenant governor, their offices or legislators. It does, however, cover state departments, local governments and schools.
Some legislators and open records advocates argue there should be no protected class in government. They say it’s time to remove the exceptions to the state’s disclosure law.
A bill introduced recently in the state House would include the governor, lieutenant governor, their offices and legislators under FOIA, though its prospects appear dim.
“It is really inconsistent with the notion that citizens come first in a democracy if we are not allowing them to have access to some of the public documents that their tax dollars pay for,” said Rep. Brandon Dillon, who introduced the bill. The Grand Rapids Democrat has introduced similar legislation twice before, in each of his previous terms.
Michigan is just one of two states where those offices are completely exempt.
