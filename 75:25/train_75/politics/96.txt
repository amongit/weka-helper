Top House GOPer wants Clinton emails
Washington (CNN)House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz will likely send the State Department a letter on Friday requesting former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton's emails, and could subpoena them if necessary.
"Subpoenaing Hillary Clinton is not the chairman's initial preference but the committee retains the authority to do so if necessary," Chaffetz spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin told CNN.
The letter will also ask questions about Clinton's use of personal email, she said.

The committee, she said, also intends to request the emails in an electronic format, rather than paper copies.
The news comes a day after Clinton defended doing government business on a personal email account, saying it was more convenient.
Clinton, who did not use a State Department email account, said she has turned over 55,000 pages of work-related email to the State Department for review. But she said she will not turn over the server that housed her personal email.
Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, said Wednesday he wants an independent review of the server.
"Chairman Gowdy believes it is in the best interest of transparency, not just for the Benghazi committee, but for all of government, the media and others who have a legitimate interest in Secretary Clinton's official record, that she voluntarily submit the server to an independent, neutral third-party arbiter to determine what is truly private and what should be a public record," said committee spokesman Jamal Ware.
Gowdy's committee has subpoenaed Clinton's emails related to Benghazi.
