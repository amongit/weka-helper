More Than Just a Gavel
There’s a lot that goes into the organization of a new Congress every two years, especially when control of a chamber passes from one party to the other. New committee ratios need to be set, staffing decisions need to be made, and chairman chosen for the dozens of committees and subcommittees that do the body’s actual work.
Prior to the 1994 election, decisions about who would lead what committee were pretty much on automatic pilot. With very few exceptions, like in the mid-1980s when the Democrats pushed Illinois Rep. Mel Price out of the chair of the House Armed Services Committee in favor of Wisconsin’s Les Aspin on the grounds that Price was no longer up to the job, the gavel was handed to the member with the most seniority.

The rules have been different since the onset of the Gingrich Congress which took, as part of its mandate to reform the House, the remarkable step of limiting the terms of committee chairman. Now – instead of a chairmanship coming vacant once every generation – the committee leadership is reshuffled after six years at the most. Interestingly, the U.S. Senate eventually adopted the same rules.
The heads of congressional committees have a lot of power. They are leaders and need to act that way. Now that their terms are limited (which is sort of the ultimate check on their power), House Speaker John Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would do well to carefully consider just who will be placed in these vital roles.
This argues for more than just an interview process – which is underway even as this column is written. It argues that every member of the House and Senate who wants to chair a committee or a subcommittee needs to develop a plan explaining what they would do with the job were they to be given the privilege – a plan that digs down into the weeds.

It’s no longer enough to simply say you’re with the party on all the important issues; you should have to present an agenda for governance, an explanation of the kinds of issues to which you would devote the committee’s time. How much time, for example, would be allocated for legislative business and how much for oversight of the government? Would you, as chairman, be willing to guarantee that legislative timelines written into law, as in the case of the Congressional Budget Act, be met? What issues would get your attention and what new ground would you be willing to break? Potential chairman should have to detail to the Steering Committee, and if necessary to the entire conference, items of importance like the number of media appearances they would be willing to do to promote the committee’s agenda, what their plan for reaching out to stakeholders is, and how they would handle dissent from within their own ranks.
Like it or not, the position of committee chairman makes one not just a legislative leader in Congress but a party leader as well. While not the main thrust of the job, it is important to know how much campaigning potential chairmen would be willing do on behalf of the congressional colleagues and challengers in order to help maintain and grow the majority. How many fundraisers will they be willing to do for the party and for candidates besides themselves and how much money are they willing to pledge they will raise to help the GOP keep is numerical superiority in both chambers?

This is not an inconsequential matter. Prior to 1994, the political support of those Republican members in line to chair committees should the GOP win the majority was crucial to the election’s outcome. In 2014, there were more than a few resource challenged candidates who came up just a little short in the balloting while incoming committee chairman sat unnecessarily on large campaign accounts.
These folks were not team players; they stand in sharp contrast to at least a couple of candidates who, while busy raising money for themselves also took the time to raise funds for the party’s national campaign organizations. This is an inequity that should not be allowed to continue moving forward.
In a lot of ways, politics in the Congress is a team sport. If the GOP wants to keep its majority – especially considering how out of balance the U.S. Senate class of 2016 is between Republicans and Democrats – then McConnell and Boehner need to start enforcing a “team spirit” now. Deciding based on the promise of future performance who gets what job chairing a committee or key subcommittee is a good place to start.
