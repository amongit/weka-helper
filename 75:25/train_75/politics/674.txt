Grade F: Many States Trail in College Funding and Tuition - US News
As states slowly recover from the Great Recession, many are still struggling to replenish funds for higher education. In fact, nearly every state still spends less on higher education now than in 2007.
The Student Impact Project, an initiative of the youth advocacy group Young Invincibles, tracked trends in higher education finance in states across the country, and graded each state based on tuition levels, state funding per student, state aid to students, the financial burden to families and higher education spending as a portion of the total state budget. It did not grade states based on outcome or academic quality measures.

In a set of report cards published Monday, the group found that on average, tuition at four-year public colleges and universities increased 28 percent between 2007 and 2013, which is two times the rate of inflation.
"When the revenue dries up states basically have two options: they can raise taxes, which is politically distasteful, or cut spending," says Tom Allison, policy and research manager for Young Invincibles. "Higher education was a big target for state legislators across the country, mainly because it’s usually a large ticket item and it’s got alternative sources of revenue, which is tuition."
It's not just that budget cuts have driven tuition up, though, Allison says. The increase in tuition that has stemmed from budget cuts is coupled with steep increases in student loan debt, which has doubled since the onset of the recession and now totals more than $1 trillion.
Colleges have become so reliant on tuition that it now makes up a larger percentage of their annual revenues than all state sources, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office.
While some states – such as Wyoming, which led all 50 states – have fared better than others, many still scored poorly on the report cards' criteria. New Hampshire, which at a 17 percent overall grade scored lowest in the country, has the highest average tuition in the country ($14,665). It also spends the least amount of money per student than any other state ($1,708), and has cut the budget almost in half since the recession, the report finds. New Hampshire also provides no state aid to students, and spends 2 percent of its overall budget on higher education.
The picture is quite different in Wyoming, where tuition is about half the national average of $8,474, the state allocates the highest amount of money per student ($16,474) and families on average are responsible for 13 percent of the full cost of college. However, the Equality State doesn't provide any state grants to needy students, and also spends a small portion of its overall budget – 5 percent – on higher education.
Overall, just four states – Wyoming, New York, Alaska and Oklahoma – received a total grade equivalent to an A, while 10 got a B, 13 got a C, 12 got a D and 11 received an F.

There's only so much the federal government can do to promote college access and affordability, because it provides "virtually no direct support" for the operation of higher education, Allison says. It does, however, contribute roughly $150 billion annually to colleges through student financial aid, as well as funding for two state grant programs to support low-income students – the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduates Programs and the College Access Challenge Grant Program.
