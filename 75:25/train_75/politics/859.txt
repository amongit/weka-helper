Obama Enjoys Popularity Boost Ahead of SOTU
President Barack Obama is riding a modest wave of momentum as he prepares to deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night, which could make it easier for him to rally support for his increasingly populist agenda.

Fifty percent of Americans approve of Obama's job performance, which is the first time he has reached majority support since May 2013, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll. This represents an increase in his approval rating of nine percentage points in the past month, while his disapproval rating has dropped by 10 points. Obama has gained 10 points among Democrats, 19 points among people younger than 30 and 22 points among Latinos.
The pollsters attribute these gains largely to improvements in the economy, including a gradual decline in the national unemployment rate and a boom on Wall Street. Forty-one percent of Americans rate the economy positively today, compared with 27 percent in October, 2013.
The bad news is that Americans, by nearly a three-to-one margin, say race relations have worsened since Obama, the first African American president, took office in January 2009, according to a poll by Al Jazeera America and Monmouth University. Forty-three percent say race relations have gotten worse, 15 percent say race relations have gotten better and 40 percent say there has been no change in race relations. And the country is deeply divided by race on questions related to race. Sixty-nine percent of African Americans and 66 percent of Latinos say discrimination is a big problem, but only 45 percent of whites feel that way. Gallup finds that 30 percent are satisfied with the state of race relations compared with 55 percent who were satisfied in 2014.

One reason for the sour mood is the recent media focus on issues of racial profiling and the killing by police of two unarmed African American men in Missouri and New York, and the murder of two New York City police officers.

I have been covering State of the Union speeches as a White House correspondent for nearly three decades. And I've learned that at this point in a two-term presidency – the start of Obama's seventh year – its tough for a chief executive to be taken as seriously as he was at the beginning. It's at the start, fresh from electoral victory, that presidents tend to be at the height of their powers and when the maximum number of people look to them for fresh leadership and new directions.
This is why the uptick in Obama's approval rating is important. It might generate more interest in what he has to say and discourage people from tuning him out.
[STATE OF THE UNION: Trivia, History, Firsts and Facts]
A big part of the State of the Union will be devoted to Obama's trumpeting what his advisers call "America's resurgence"--improvements in the economy. But many middle-class workers have suffered from wage and income stagnation, which Obama is also trying to address in his new tax proposals.
A centerpiece of his address will be a proposal to hike taxes on the wealthy and big corporations, and use the money to provide tax breaks for the middle class. But Obama's economic package has little chance to pass Congress, which is controlled by Republicans and where Obama's opponents say he is returning to the tax-and-spend ways of the Democratic left.
Democratic strategists say Obama is confident that most voters will back his ideas over the GOP's, and he is setting the stage for Democratic gains in the 2016 election.
