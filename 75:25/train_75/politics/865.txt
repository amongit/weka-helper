Obama Plans Cybersecurity Push
President Barack Obama's preview of his State of the Union address rolls on this week, as he makes a pitch for new initiatives to protect Americans' cybersecurity and internet access.
Obama plans to visit the Federal Trade Commission Monday to unveil his proposals to fight identity theft, protect internet privacy and expand use of technology in schools, White House officials told reporters. He also plans to discuss government efforts to work with business to protect cybersecurity. On Tuesday, he is scheduled to visit the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to discuss cybersecurity threats and information-sharing.

Obama plans to visit Iowa Wednesday to announce ways to "increase access to affordable, high-speed broadband across the country," a White House spokesman said.
Giving impetus to Obama's proposals was the hacking of Sony in November, which U.S. officials blamed in part on North Korea's government.
It's all part of the president's campaign to drum up support for a new wave of administration ideas that Obama plans to include in his January 20 State of the Union address. Last week, he proposed an ambitious new program to pay tuition for many community college students.

More broadly, Obama is scheduled to meet Tuesday with congressional leaders of both major parties to discuss legislation that he hopes the House and Senate will approve this year, such as the community-college tuition program.
But 2015 hasn't started off on a positive note. Obama has threatened to veto legislation, popular in both the House and Senate, to approve the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the United States. This set the stage for a confrontation between the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress.
