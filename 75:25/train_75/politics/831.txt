Forty-five percent of Americans view the Israeli leader favorably and only 24 percent see him unfavorably, according to a poll by Gallup. That's an improvement from a 35 percent favorable rating in July 2012. The remainder of Americans have no opinion of Netanyahu.
As with so many other issues, the partisan breakdown is stark. Sixty percent of Republicans have a favorable view of Netanyahu while 31 percent of Democrats have a positive view. Forty-five percent of independents see him positively.
In an statement summarizing the poll, Gallup analyst Andrew Dugan said, "Despite Americans' support for Israel and a long history of close ties between the two countries, Netanyahu has found himself in a major political controversy by coming to Washington to address Congress against the wishes of the White House. But the political tension felt in the nation's capital has not hurt Netanyahu's image with the American public at large. Americans see him about as favorably today as they did [in] any of the six measurements Gallup has taken since 1996. The dust-up with the White House may have won Netanyahu more independent and Republican admirers while at the same time not costing him Democratic support."
Obama and Netanyahu have a distant relationship, aggravated when the Israeli leader accepted an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, R.-Ohio, to speak to the Republican-controlled Congress without coordinating in advance with Obama's Democratic administration.
Netanyahu is expected to warn that the U.S. administration is negotiating a dangerous deal with Iran over the Tehran regime's nuclear program, which he says is developing nuclear weapons that threaten Israel's survival.
