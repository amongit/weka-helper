Here's Where the Cuban Refugees Live
Following the release of American Alan Gross from Cuban prisons, it's likely tension between the United States and Cuba will relax, which could pave the way for trade, travel and yes, more cigars.
Many Cubans already live in the U.S. as refugees. The U.S. is the primary destination for migrants from Cuba, with over a million people born in Cuba living in the country. Spain and Italy follow far behind, with 120,000 Cubans living in Spain and 30,000 in Italy, according to data from Pew Research Center.
After traveling to the U.S., many Cubans settle in Florida where half of the refugee population arriving in fiscal year 2012 was Cuban. Cubans also formed a high percentage of the refugee population in New Jersey (almost 40 percent) and in Nevada (25 percent), according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
