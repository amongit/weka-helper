Maine to weigh giving governor, lawmakers a pay boost
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Maine’s future governor and lawmakers could get a pay boost under a bill before the Legislature.
The State and Local Government Committee will hold a public hearing on Democratic Rep. John Martin’s bill on Monday. It would increase the governor’s salary in 2019 from $70,000 a year to $120,000 a year. Lawmakers’ salaries would also go up from about $24,000 over two years to $41,000.
The committee will also consider another bill from Martin that would abolish term limits for lawmakers. Lawmakers in the House and Senate are currently limited to four two-year terms. But they often get around it by switching back and forth between the chambers.
Martin, who is Maine’s longest-serving lawmaker, recently began his 24th term in the Legislature.
