The chairman of the Republican National Committee says Chris Christie should stay put as leader of the party's political group for governors.
In an interview with CNN, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus rejected Ken Cuccinelli's call for Christie to quit the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association amid controversies over political payback. Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general who lost his bid for governor in November, is the most prominent Republican to date to say Christie should step aside.
"I don't know of a better governor right now to lead that effort that is just a powerhouse across the country," Priebus said Wednesday about Christie. "I have seen seen him turn crowds on and his job is to raise a lot of money for the RGA and he can do that and I am sure the RGA is proud to have him."
A new poll released Wednesday shows Christie's favorable rating has dropped since the scandal over intentional traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge broke into wide view two weeks ago. Christie's favorable rating among New Jersey voters is now at 46%, according to the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll. That's down from a 65% favorable rating in November, taken just before Christie won a landslide re-election.
The survey showed Christie's support among Democrats, who had positive views of the governor in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, dropped 26 percentage points.
"Other polls taken immediately after the bridge scandal broke showed relatively small effects," said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll and a political scientist at Rutgers University. "But with another week of revelations, damage appears to have been done. The good will the governor built up among Democrats with his handling of the Sandy aftermath is gone, at least for now."
