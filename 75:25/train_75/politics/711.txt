1.5 Million Applications Submitted on Federal Marketplace
During the second week of open enrollment for plans mandated under the Affordable Care Act, more than half a million applications were submitted, according to new data from the Department of Health and Human Services.
Views on the website, applications and signups are down after last week's opening surge. HHS expects an increase in applications around the first deadline on Dec. 15. The final deadline is Feb. 15, 2015.
Plan selections total slightly more than three quarters of a million so far. Last month, HHS projected between 9 and 9.9 million people would sign up for coverage through the exchanges for next year.
