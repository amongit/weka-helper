Delhi elections: Arvind Kejriwal asks AAP workers not to get arrogant in politics like BJP, Congress
New Delhi: Aam Admi Party's (AAP) chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal has asked his party members not to get arrogant after the overwhelming victory in the Delhi Assembly elections.
Addressing party workers at AAP office in Patel Nagar on Tuesday, Kejriwal said, "The massive mandate that the people of Delhi have given us, I appeal to AAP workers not get arrogant at all. What has happened to BJP and Congress is because of their arrogance."
Kejriwal sought the support of everyone in the betterment of Delhi and said he cannot do anything alone.
He also thanked the people of Delhi for AAP's remarkable victory. "I thank the people of Delhi. I salute the people of Delhi. I congratulate the workers. This is a victory of honesty," he said.
He said the results are overwhelming. "This is a victory of the AAP workers," he said, adding that the win is "very scary".
Introducing his wife to the cheering crowd, the AAP chief thanked her and said she never comes in the limelight. "Whatever I do is because of my wife's support," he said.
"This is my wife. She is a government employee and, therefore, she was afraid that the government may act against her if she came out. But I told her not to be afraid of the government. No one will act against her," he said.
He said family support is a must for dedication in work. "It is because of her continuous support that I have been able to work like this," he said.
