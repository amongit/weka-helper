Marco Rubio Says He Understands Feeling 'Taken Advantage Of' By Immigrants
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In some versions of a story published on Jan. 6 and 7, The Associated Press reported that Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, in his new book, proposes an overhaul of the nation's immigration system that would allow people living in the country illegally to apply for permanent residency, but not citizenship. The story should have made clear that, while the book does not specifically address the question of citizenship, current U.S. law allows for immigrants who win permanent residency to later apply to become U.S. citizens.
