Pleasing the Castros
Now we know.
After more than six years of fruitless efforts to shut down the terrorist detention facility located on the grounds of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, it's finally clear why it’s one of those things on which President Barack Obama has refused to drop the issue: It’s what the Castros want.
"The re-establishment of diplomatic relations is the start of a process of normalizing bilateral relations, but this will not be possible while the blockade still exists, while they don't give back the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo naval base," Cuban President Raul Castro – brother of Fidel – said Wednesday at a summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.

In addition Castro wants an end to the 50-plus-year-old trade embargo and compensation for the economic damage it caused since being imposed during the Kennedy administration as a precursor to any normalization of relations with the United States. “If these problems aren't resolved, this diplomatic rapprochement wouldn't make any sense,” The Associated Press quoted the younger Castro saying.
Remember that Obama’s promise to close down Gitmo goes back as far as the 2008 election, the original plan being to bring the detainees to a facility somewhere in the United States where they would be held before being released or tried for their crimes. That didn’t fly, mostly because there weren’t enough people in Congress willing to try and defend to the folks back home a vote to bring the terrorists here.
Lately Obama’s been pursuing what might be called Plan B: Make Gitmo unnecessary by emptying it out, sending these suspected terrorists back to the Middle East and to Southwest Asia on the grounds they were harmless.

Well, they’re not. A number of them have been recaptured or killed on the battlefield. One of the five who were released in exchange for the return of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl (who many believe was not so much a prisoner as he was a deserter) is the latest to be suspected of returning to the fight against the United States, Christendom and Western civilization.
“The president’s determination to empty Guantanamo Bay continues to be a victory for terrorist groups,” said House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, in a recent release. “In his rush to release extremist detainees back onto the streets, the president has naively ignored his top intelligence officials who have pointed out that many of these hardened militants are returning to the fight. How many wake-up calls does the president need?”

“These actions are putting American lives at risk. I hope this news is enough to convince the president to immediately halt all planned releases from Guantanamo Bay and to reassess his misguided detainee policy,” he continued.
It’s now obvious that normalization of relations with Cuba, which the American left still believes is a workers’ paradise with model education and health care systems, has been the real objective all along. Red diaper babies like Valerie Jarrett, arguably the second most powerful person in the White House after the president, have long had a love affair with the island and its dictatorship which – in their minds – probably represents the victory of the 99 percent over the 1 percent. To them it’s a harmless, overdue move – the island’s communist detention camps, terror campaigns, secret police and limits on political and religious liberties notwithstanding. The evils perpetuated by the Cuban communist dictatorship are long and well documented and should not be overlooked by U.S. politicians any more than they will be by the Cuban people once the Castro brothers join Lenin, Stalin, Che Guevara and other such notables residing currently in the fire ash heaps of eternity. Meanwhile Obama has embarked on a dangerous policy of letting the terrorists go in order to empty Gitmo, putting U.S. personnel in the field throughout the world in danger and, once again, making America look weak. Congress ought to act now to take this particular carrot off the table and to make it clear it will not allow the Castros to dictate the terms of their surrender. There must be free elections first, under international supervision, before any other concessions will even be discussed. Nothing else will do and anything else will be a betrayal of the hopes and aspirations for freedom that still beat in the hearts of the Cuban people like a conga drum.
