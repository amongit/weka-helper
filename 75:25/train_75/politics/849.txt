Bush, Clinton Face Headwinds in 2016 Race
With the exit of Mitt Romney from the 2016 presidential race, the two best-positioned remaining potential candidates, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, face similar problems as establishment leaders during a time of political ferment.
If they run, as expected, they will be prime targets for everyone else in the campaign and for the news media. They will need to reassure zealous factions in their parties that prefer more ideologically pure nominees. For Clinton, the biggest threat to her winning the Democratic nomination probably comes from the left. For Bush, the threat for the Republican nomination probably comes from the right. Both of them also will be called upon to explain why their experience, their family ties and their connections to the political establishment should outweigh the desire of many voters for new blood and fresh faces.

For the immediate future, both are trying to lock up as many big donors as they can, which both Clinton and Bush are better positioned to do than their intra-party rivals.
Romney's exit means that Bush, son of a former president and brother of another, and former two-term governor of Florida, will have an easier time recruiting Romney's formidable array of financial contributors from the former Republican nominee's failed 2012 campaign.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is thought to have a chance to recruit some of Romney's donors, who helped Romney and allied groups raise $1 billion in the 2012 presidential cycle. But Christie hasn't caught on with the party's base and Bush is considered far ahead in amassing donors so far. This is partly because he can tap into the network of Republicans who earlier backed his father and brother.
However, Bush still has to prove himself to many conservative activists who play a big role in GOP politics in key states. Bush "becomes the target for everyone who is anti-establishment," Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican party, told the Washington Post. "Before, you had Romney and Bush kind of splitting up that ire."

Many GOP voters are worried that Bush will be tarred with the unpopular policies of his father, George H.W. Bush, who broke his pledge not to raise taxes, and his brother George W. Bush, who began the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and who was president during an economic meltdown.
In Iowa, the first state to hold presidential nominating caucuses, Bush did poorly in a new poll of GOP voters who say they will vote in those caucuses a year from now. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker came in first with 15 percent, followed by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky with 14 percent; Romney with 13 percent (the poll was conducted before he announced Friday that he wasn't running); former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas with 10 percent, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson with 9 percent, and Bush with 8 percent. All the other potential GOP candidates lagged behind, according to the poll, which was conducted by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register.
When Romney's supporters were re-distributed to their second choices, Walker, Paul, Huckabee and Carson remained the top four and Bush gained only one percentage point, moving from 8 percent to 9 percent. The situation in Iowa remains fluid and Bush still could surge into the lead, but he has a lot of work to do.
On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton had the support of 56 percent of likely Iowa caucus-goers, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with 16 percent; Vice President Joe Biden with 9 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, with 5 percent. This means 21 percent of these Iowa Democrats -- the ones supporting vociferous liberals Warren and Sanders (neither of whom has declared a candidacy) -- prefer someone further to the left than Clinton. They haven't jumped on her bandwagon despite her lead in national polls and her credentials that include serving as first lady during her husband Bill Clinton's administration, U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under President Barack Obama.
This could be a danger sign. It's a reminder that even though Clinton also was the early front-runner in 2008 when she sought the Democratic nomination, Obama defeated her in Iowa and went on to win the nomination and the White House.
Although Bill Clinton is enjoying a surge in popularity, especially among Democrats, Republican strategists say voters are still troubled because he lied about his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and Hillary Clinton may have to address that messy issue again.
Overall, a large majority of voters say the country is headed in the wrong direction. And some pollsters predict that Americans will want the next president to represent something new. This is not a strong point for either Bush or Clinton, who bear two of the most familiar names in American politics.
