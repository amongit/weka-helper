Poll: Americans Want GOP to Set Direction
More bad news for President Barack Obama: In the aftermath of Republican victories in the midterm election, a majority of Americans – 53 percent – want GOP legislators in Congress to have more influence over the country's direction than Obama during the next year.
This is a turnaround from early 2012 when 46 percent wanted Obama to have more influence and 42 percent favored Congress, according to the latest Gallup poll.

Republicans took control of the Senate and added to their House majority in the midterm election last week.
The Gallup poll also found that 44 percent of Americans say the GOP takeover won't make a difference in altering national conditions, compared with 34 percent who say the country will be better off and 19 percent who say it will be worse off.
Gallup analyst Lydia Saad said in a memo to reporters, "The midterm election provided a clear signal as to which party voters want to control Congress. That message is echoed in the results of the latest Gallup poll showing Americans expressly asking for the Republicans – rather than Obama – to guide the direction the country takes in the next year. But, after four years of partisan gridlock, most Americans are not optimistic that the election's outcome will improve things."
The GOP's 17-point margin over Obama on setting the country's direction exceeds their edge after the last midterm election, in 2010, when Americans favored Republicans on this measure by an eight point margin, 49-41.
