Failed GOP Candidate Changes Name To Cesar Chavez, Runs As Democrat
Scott Fistler, a GOP candidate from Arizona who previously failed at runs for both Congress and the Phoenix City Council, will now be running to fill Rep. Ed Pastor's (D-Ariz.) seat in the heavily Hispanic 7th congressional district. But this time, he'll be running as Cesar Chavez, a Democrat.
The Arizona Capitol Times reports that in November, Fistler petitioned a state superior court and paid $319 to legally change his name to that of the famous labor leader, stating in the petition that because of his name, he's "experienced many hardships."
His campaign website has photos of people marching not for Scott Fistler turned Cesar Chavez, but for deceased socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
In an interview with the Arizona Republic, Fistler admitted the benefits of having a name affiliated with a beloved figure among Hispanics in Arizona.
"It's almost as simple as saying Elvis Presley is running for president," Fistler said. "You wouldn't forget it, would you?"
"People want a name that they can feel comfortable with," he added. "If you went out there running for office and your name was Bernie Madoff, you'd probably be screwed."
Despite Fistler's creative attempts to increase his chances of winning the seat, his plan may end up backfiring on him. Fistler filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC in February as a Democrat, though he didn't change his party affiliation until April 28.
DJ Quinlan, executive director of the Arizona Democratic Party, tweeted his thoughts on Fistler's candidacy:
.@johnron @EvanWyloge Wish it was a joke. This seems to be part of the GOP's Hispanic outreach program. #
