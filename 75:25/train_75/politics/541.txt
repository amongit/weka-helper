Here's The Sweet Way Nancy Pelosi Showed Support For Recovering Harry Reid
Congress does more than just fight, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) proved that Thursday when she showed up for a press conference with a sign of support for her Senate counterpart, Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who's recovering from eye surgery.
Reid, who fell and injured himself while exercising in January, had surgery on his right eye two weeks ago. He had been wearing a bandage over the eye. However, Tuesday he was spotted wearing some sweet shades that looked slightly out of place inside the Capitol.

When Pelosi joined Reid for a press conference in the Senate Thursday morning, she pulled out her own pair of sunglasses. Reid, however, had swapped his eyewear for a pair of clear glasses.
"I brought my glasses to be like Harry, but he switched on me," @NancyPelosi says. pic.twitter.com/cyKqRzel3E
