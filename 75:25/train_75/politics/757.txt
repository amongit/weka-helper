Yes, Obama's Presidency Is Getting Better
The president is doing his job better. In 2014, all five months of it, he has shown more boldness and brio, and less political innocence, at home. Abroad, his foreign policy might be defined as "less is more." We've had too much of more for most of the 21st century.
Political experience has given him gray hair and taught him the limits – and the powers – of his office. Since legislation is log-jammed, he is governing less by laws and more by unilateral actions. The American people are more interested in actions and results than his command of the English language.
Wisely, President Obama is not trying to have beer summits or to hang out with his enemies in the House anymore. He is showing more resolve by slashing coal emissions by 2030 through the Environmental Protection Agency, as the White House has announced. He let a weakened cabinet secretary, Eric Shinseki of Veterans Affairs, go in a classy way. He finally rid himself of a weak cabinet secretary, Katheleen Sebelius, who let health care reform go awry. He's prepared to move on with better people in place, such as Sylvia Mathews Burwell to succeed Sebelius at the Department of Health And Human Services. Already, relationships across the aisle brightened, at least for a day or two.

A leader must have clarity about who his friends and foes are, and treat them accordingly. After a freefall (pardon the pun) last fall over health care, Obama has recovered well enough that the 2014 midterms won't be all about that. He is raising millions at party fundraisers, even though it seems foreordained that the House will stay Republican. He knows that if Democrats lose the Senate, they can shut up shop and all go fishing together until 2016. Besides raising money, Obama seems to have more focus and school spirit than he did in 2010, when he wasn't paying attention and his party lost the House.
To be sure, Obama is not exactly a team player in politics, but he's doing a better job of showing the team that he cares. He's exerting more energy not only in fundraising, but in foreign travel. He just got back from Asia and now he's off to Europe. Lest we forget, think how much more proud we can be of the urbane Obama representing the United States of America than the oafish George W. Bush, the "war president."

Speaking of the 43rd president, it's no small thing to see the end of his wars come to pass. It's a lot easier to start a war (with no draft) than to end a war. So I am all for Obama's insistence that he is a peacenik. Actually, he never said that, but he did win a Nobel Peace Prize. I am all for staying away from Ukraine and Syria and wherever the neo-cons want us to go. The Washington Post opinion page derides this as a "values-free foreign policy." Excuse me, but less is more.
I, for one, hope the "peace president" sticks to his guns (figuratively), because he is reading the war-weary American public right, not to mention an exhausted army. We all need to study war no more.
