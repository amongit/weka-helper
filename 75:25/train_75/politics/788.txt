America Doesnâ€™t Need Another Arrogant Harvard Man
Oh Larry, Larry, Larry. Character is destiny, or didn't you learn that at Harvard?
The brilliant but arrogant Lawrence H. Summers has learned his first public lesson in humility. The Senate Democrats weren't all willing to follow President Obama's lead and confirm him for Federal Reserve Chairman.
Summers was the economist who noted the Obama White House in the early days was like "Home Alone." An astute witticism, but nobody inside the beleaguered Obama White House is laughing in its fifth and rockiest year yet.
[Check out our editorial cartoons on President Obama.]
The truth hurts. The president can't persuade his own party to support his choice for Senate confirmation.
The Syria strike debate revealed how little mastery Obama has over the Senate. For Summers, who knew how problematic his journey would be, that was the writing on the wall. His penchant for condescending comments and his reputation for weak financial regulation as treasury secretary made Summers unpopular on Capitol Hill.
As a result, he withdrew his name from contention in a phone call to the president.

Bill Clinton used to ask Larry how many people he had insulted that day. Later Summers managed to alienate the Harvard women faculty by suggesting women do not excel at science and math.
Finally, the president is a Harvard snob, a factor that clouded his judgment. The American people don't need another arrogant Harvard man as captain of the country's helm. We've already got one.
