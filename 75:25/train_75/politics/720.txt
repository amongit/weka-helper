AIDS by the Numbers
As people marked the 26th annual World AIDS Day with awareness campaigns and red ribbons on Monday, groups like UNAIDS, who are working for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, say they plan to have the epidemic eradicated by 2030. Though recent data indicate they gradually are moving toward their goal, at this time HIV/AIDS is still the No. 1 cause of death by infection worldwide.
Since the first cases were reported in the U.S. in 1981, 39 million people have died from the virus, including 1.5 million globally last year alone.
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, kills or damages the body's immune system cells, which protect people against diseases. HIV is spread most often through unprotected sex with an infected person, but can also be spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of someone who is infected. Women can also pass it along to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. The most advanced stage of infection with HIV is AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, which can take two to 15 years to develop. Without treatment, the virus can make people vulnerable to​ fatal diseases.
There is no cure, but scientific advancements have helped stabilize those who are infected and help reduce the risk of transmission to others. HIV-positive people who take antiretroviral medications can suppress the virus, allowing them to live a normal lifespan and reducing the risk of transmission to others.

In July, as many as 100 HIV/AIDS scientists researchers and activists were killed in the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash, while traveling to the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. Former International AIDS Society president Dr. Joep Lange was among the researchers who died.
"Through his research, [Lange] built a body of evidence to prove the transformative effect treatment can have on people living with HIV," wrote the International AIDS Society at the time.​​ Lange's partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, who was a longtime HIV advocate, was also killed in the crash. "Their deaths are a tragic loss to the fight against HIV globally."​
In spite of the losses, there are reasons to be hopeful: The number of people newly infected with HIV has declined since 2001, and the number of deaths AIDS-related has declined since 2005.​ Treatment is progressing, and scientists have made key findings in recent years; in July, the World Health Organization in July recommended the use of Pre-exposure prophylaxis like Truvada for HIV-negative partners of people with HIV after finding that, when taken consistently, the antiretroviral reduced the risk of infection by 92 percent.
The U.S. is the largest donor to international aid efforts to combat HIV around the world. In Fiscal Year 2014, Congress appropriated $4.9 billion for bilateral HIV and 1.65 billion for the Global Fund, which is an organization working to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. For Fiscal Year 2015, the president has requested $300 million less, and congressional approval is pending.
