Woman at center of Va. lawmaker’s cases gives birth to boy
RIHCMOND, Va. (AP) - A young woman at the center of two criminal cases involving a Virginia lawmaker has given birth to a baby.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1G9fXr3 ) reports that Del. Joseph Morrissey on Sunday confirmed the birth of a 7-pound, 8-ounce boy. Morrissey told the newspaper he wouldn’t make any further comment.
The newspaper says no information has been released regarding the child’s father.
Morrissey was released from jail last week after completing a sentence for a misdemeanor. The 57-year-old lawmaker pleaded no contest in December 2014 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor in a sex scandal involving a 17-year-old girl.
He faces an April 28 trial on charges of forging a document that purportedly shows the girl’s father had agreed to pay $50 a week into her college fund.
