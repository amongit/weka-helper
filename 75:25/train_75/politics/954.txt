Elmendorf Is Out, But Who Is In?
He may not know it yet but, according to senior congressional staffers with ties to the Budget Committee and the House leadership, Doug Elmendorf is out as director of the Congressional Budget Committee.
It may not yet be officially official, but Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, wants somebody new running the agency that, by statute, is charged with determining how much proposed legislation will add to or subtract from the federal treasury.
The position of CBO director was established in 1974 by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, one of the first in a series of Watergate-era reforms that fundamentally changed the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government.

According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, the mission of the CBO is to “support the House and Senate in the federal budget process by providing budgetary analysis and information” and to prepare “annual reports on the economic and budget outlook and on the President’s budget proposals.” It also, and this is a key point for those who are apparently winning the argument over the need for change at the top, “provides cost estimates of legislation, scorekeeping reports, assessments of unfunded mandates” and other materials essential to discussions of taxing and spending.
Elmendorf has been caught with his hand in the statistical cookie jar on more than one occasion. As reported by The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other outlets, under his leadership the CBO determined more than once that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which most of us know as Obamacare – would lead to reductions in the federal deficit. Using the same data, however, the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee calculated the act would produce a $131 billion increase in the deficit over the same 10-year period measured by Elmendorf’s analysts.
With so much on its plate for the beginning of the year – including but not limited to consideration of a fiscal year 2016 budget resolution, budget reconciliation and the Keystone XL pipeline legislation – Congress will be extremely reliant on the CBO to provide accurate scores. There is a developing consensus among congressional spending hawks on and off Capitol Hill that this will be impossible with Elmendorf in charge. It is almost certain that Price believes this, according to people who are familiar with the unfolding situation.

Up to now, the delay in appointing a replacement could have been blamed on the U.S. Senate’s indecision over who would chair its Budget Committee in the upcoming session: Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions, who had been the committee’s ranking member, or Wyoming’s Mike Enzi, who has just a little bit more seniority. Now that the debate has ended – Enzi will be the chairman – some people are arguing the need for the appointment of a new director before the end of the year so it will be clear there is a change in direction coming.
This is as much a matter of politics as it is of economic analysis. The American people voted for a major change, and a major check on the excesses of the Obama administration, in the last election. The CBO “score” will be critically important to what incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner want to try and accomplish using the mandate given them by the voters.
Bad estimates will not only lead to bad policy (as was the case when CBO previously estimated the Affordable Care Act would trim the deficit by more than $140 billion over 10 years) but will produce political problems for the new Republican majority. No one can make much sense of why the incoming congressional leadership has not, for that reason, made finding a replacement for Elmendorf a priority. It is a decision that will affect so much of what happens further down the road that there is no excuse for foot-dragging on the issue by McConnell or Boehner, Price or Enzi. There are plenty of very qualified candidates out there who want the job. Pick one and get moving.
