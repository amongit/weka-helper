Dubya: Jeb Would Beat Hillary
Former President George W. Bush praises Hillary Clinton as a formidable politician but he says his brother Jeb would defeat her if both of them ran for president in 2016.
Bush told CNN that he and his family have developed a warm relationship with former President Bill Clinton, Hillary's husband. Bush sometimes calls his predecessor his "brother from another mother." And he told CNN this makes Hillary Clinton "my sister in law."
But when asked if Jeb could run against Hillary, he said, "Yeah, and I think he'd beat her."

He added: "He knows I want him to run. If I need to reiterate it, I will: Run, Jeb. I think he'd be a great president."
The relationship between the Bush and Clinton families has been full of emotional ups and downs. Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush, George W.'s father, in 1992, and it was a bitter loss for the Bush family. Then the younger Bush defeated Vice President Al Gore, Clinton's No. 2, in a 2000 campaign that featured Bush suggesting that Clinton had tarnished the presidency because of the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-lies scandal.
In recent years, the harsh feelings of the past have faded. Bush the father and Bill Clinton have developed a friendship, and George W. Bush and Clinton have also become pals, family friends say.

But when it comes to politics, Bush's loyalty is to his brother, the former Republican governor of Florida. "He's seen what it's like to be the son of a president," the former president told CNN in an interview aired Sunday. "He's seen what it's like to be the brother of a president. And therefore he's being very--he is not rushing into running for the presidency. I have no clue where his head is now."
Jeb Bush says he is still making up his mind, and polls indicate that if he ran for the Republican nomination, he would have tough competition from other GOP candidates. Hillary Clinton also says she hadn't made up her mind, but polls indicate she is a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination.
