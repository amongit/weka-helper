60 Turning 60 In 2014
This September I turn 60. As I enter The Final Third, I find myself dumbfounded about where the last 60 years have gone, and driven to take stock and sort it all out. In addition, I want to hedge my bets for the next 30. With nothing really big calling my name, I don't have much of a bucket-list. All I know is that I want to keep going and keep learning.
A few weeks ago I started researching others who were sharing this milestone with me. I've always paid close attention to the patterns and themes that are woven into the tapestry of life and I was interested in the subtle commonalities my fellow 1954 babies share. We came into the world smack-dab in the middle of the baby boom. This year, 2014, we turn 60. Who did I miss? Write me and tell me, especially if I missed you. I would love to hear about what life is like for you at 60. Here is my list of 60 turning 60.

His hot accent was enough to make us swoon before, but now that Neeson has taken on more action roles, we're in love. Neeson tip-toed back onto the dating scene in 2010, a year and a half after the tragic death of his late wife Natasha Richardson.
She's over 50, but she still looks like an uptown girl. We'd love to know her secret.
She may be snuggling up to John Corbett, but without a ring around that finger, we see no problem with day dreaming.
Our hearts break every time we watch Carrie dump this gorgeous guy on "Sex And The City" reruns. Don't worry, John, we're here to comfort you ... although we're sure Bo would prefer we didn't.
Hugh Grant's mischievous smile still gets us. And who can resist him after that adorable dance number in "Love Actually"?
Madonna. Do we need to say anything else?
Who wouldn't want to spend time with one of the most interesting and influential people around?
Is "awe-stricken" the right way to describe how we feel about Penn? Yup, that seems right.
She's stunning and her voice is unbelievable ... a definite 10.
Can you say breakfast in bed?
Cattrall is basically the definition of sexy post 50.
We couldn't take our eyes off Stone in films like "Basic Instinct" and "Casino," and we still can't.
Did you see Keener's smoking-hot bod in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin"? She's a stunner, and she makes us laugh -- the perfect Valentine!
We loved Robbins with Susan Sarandon, but if they must be apart then we'll just say it: He's such a cutie.
Sarandon is one classy woman and one classic beauty.
We wouldn't mind getting lost in those amazing blues while laughing the night away over at 30 Rock.
With this mane, Andie MacDowell is an absolute show stopper.
There's no one we'd rather snuggle up with and hide behind while watching "American Horror Story."
She came into our lives in the 80s, and we hope this lovely woman stays for many more years.
Did you really think we'd make a list of the most eligible post 50s and leave out George Clooney? He is the quintessential heart throb, after all.
