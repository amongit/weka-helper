Finally, a Clear GOP Agenda
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus took the opportunity Thursday to explain just what the Grand Old Party is “for.”
It’s an important consideration. In elections, there is an old saw that holds people would rather vote for the devil they know over the devil they don’t because things could always be worse. Everyone knows by now – unless they have been living under a rock for the last six years – what the GOP is against. The party and its political leaders have been less successful cutting through the continuous cacophony of background noise generated by the president and his fellow Democrats in their effort to explain to voters outside the party’s natural base just what it stands for today – without a Ronald Reagan, a Jack Kemp or a Newt Gingrich at the helm, articulating a clear vision for moving the country forward.
“Our overarching vision is a country that offers equal opportunity for everyone,” the chairman said, adding that, “In pursuit of that vision, our party’s three core values have long been a strong economy, a strong society and a strong defense. The Principles for American Renewal, which I’m outlining today, fit into those three categories.”

As a matter of political necessity, the framework should be reassuring to the GOP’s fractured base. Up to now, the effort to produce a winning electoral coalition has been held together by duct tape and bailing wire as third party groups, current, former and future presidential candidates and the leaders in Congress have often been at odds over what the party’s main focus should be.
The infighting that has resulted has been, in a word, unhelpful. The lack of agreement on the end goals meant it has been difficult for people of good will and even better intentions to agree on how best to proceed. This led some to make a foolhardy attempt at ideological cleansing, reading people out of the party and the conservative movement over issues that were, frankly, neither life nor death; nor were they grounded for the most part in the so-called “first principles,” the ideological formulation of modern conservatism in a political context developed and expounded by people like Russell Kirk and William F. Buckley Jr. that ultimately became the “Reagan Revolution.”
Priebus’ 11 principles – which differ from Gingrich’s "Contract with America" in that there are not specific legislative proposals – represent a series of intellectually consistent options upon which candidates may draw in the closing days of the 2014 campaign as they attempt to show voters what is involved in the choices they are being asked to make in just about a month. They show a contrast of visions on policies from health care to education to national defense that will widen the comfort zone that self-described independents, swing voters and disaffected Democrats may need to have before they are willing to cast their ballots for representatives of the party of George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz – all of whom are, to various degrees, polarizing figures.

The principles themselves are vision statements, concepts that are clear and lead easily to both legislative and private sector solutions, further underscoring the idea that the Republicans are the party of limited government with specific and defined purposes that are significantly less elastic than what has been the case under President Barack Obama. They also, and this is critically important, touch upon a wide range of issues underneath at least one of the three core values that inform the party’s overall approach to governance.
According to Priebus, those issues are:
The specifics, said individuals close to the chairman, will be left for the party’s congressional and state legislative leaders to determine after (one at least hopes) considerable input from the voters and grassroots. What matters is that Priebus has constructed an outline that works for candidates at all levels of government and in all regions of the country and allows competing forces within the policy-making marketplace of ideas to come up with the best way forward – and on a bipartisan basis, if possible.
One of the earliest endorsers of the themes Priebus laid out besides Gingrich, who praised the principles in an email sent to supporters and in a message to his million-plus followers on social media, is Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, a tea party favorite and one who has been driving the idea of the GOP as “the party of ideas” for many months on what sometimes seemed an awfully lonely quest. Priebus, Lee said in a statement, “has laid out the case for how Republicans should succeed this fall.”
“We have a broad agenda to address Americans’ economic and national security concerns, while the Democrats are forced to run on their failed record of Obamacare, unemployment, and debt. The choice couldn’t be more clear and it’s up to the American people to decide the course we take," the junior senator from Utah said. "Chairman Priebus succinctly expressed Republican core principles and values, and presented numerous examples of solutions Republicans have produced by applying those principles to the challenges facing working families today.”

Ultimately, candidates for office have to be “for” something if they reasonably expect to win. That’s the essential difference between simply being against the Affordable Care Act (which is how the Democrats continue to describe the GOP’s position on health care) and “repeal and replace” Obamacare (the winning Republican message of the 2010 election).
“The way to win is to tell voters what they’ll get with a Republican majority,” David Winston, an adviser to House Speaker John Boehner, told the Los Angeles Times’ Doyle McManus. “That’s what worked in 1994, and it worked again in 2010.” And, Priebus and company apparently hope, will work in 2014 while laying the groundwork for a successful comeback and a winning presidential campaign in 2016 as well.
