Poll Finds Pessimistic America
Americans have traditionally been optimistic about the future and confident in their ability to succeed. Today, not so much.
Sixty-four percent of Americans still believe in the American dream, but that's the lowest level in two decades, according to the latest New York Times poll. Even during the financial crisis of 2009, 72 percent of Americans still believed that hard work could result in financial success. More than 80 percent believed in the American dream in 2011 and 2000.
Fifty-two percent of Americans say the country's economic system is fair and gives everyone the opportunity to succeed; 45 percent say it is unfair.
[PANEL: Americans in Sour Mood]
Nearly 60 percent say their household finances have stagnated and more than three-quarters say they are concerned about having enough money for retirement.
This kind of pessimism on a personal level helps to explain why Americans' mood is sour, according to the polls, even though there has been positive macroeconomic news recently, such as job growth nationwide and a decline in oil prices.
