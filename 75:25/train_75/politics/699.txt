Americans: Gun Rights More Important Than Gun Control
For the first time in more than two decades, Americans have said gun rights are more important than gun control, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. The survey comes on the heels of the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and follows an upward trend for mass shootings in the U.S.
In the survey, 52 percent of respondents said it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns, and 46 percent said controlling gun ownership was more important.
There was a 9-point increase since 2012 in the percentage of Americans who said gun ownership protects people from becoming crime victims, as opposed to putting people's safety at risk. Nearly 40 percent said gun ownership does more to put people's safety at risk.
Differences in viewpoints were seen along racial and party lines, although black Americans' belief that gun ownership protects people surged by 25 percentage points between December 2012 and December 2014. Republicans holding the same belief also jumped by 17 percentage points.
