Obama Denies Misleading Anericans on Health Care - US News
President Barack Obama has denied that his controversial health care law was falsely presented to the public in order to insure its passage, as congressional Republicans expressed outrage at the deceptions described by a former academic adviser to the administration.
"The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run," Obama said.

He was referring to remarks, captured on videotape, by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who was paid nearly $400,000 to serve as a consultant to the administration on health care in 2009-2010. Gruber told an academic panel in 2013 that parts of the Obama plan were kept intentionally vague to take advantage of the "stupidity" of American voters. Gruber also said "lack of transparency is a huge political advantage."
Obama repudiated Gruber's remarks during a news conference in Brisbane, Australia, on Sunday. Asked by reporters if he intentionally misled the public, Obama replied, "No, I did not." He said the law, known as Obamacare, was extensively debated in Congress and widely covered by the news media, and nothing was intentionally hidden.
Obama also said the second annual open enrollment period for the health care law, which began Saturday, has been going well, in contrast to the Obamacare website's disastrous rollout a year ago. "So far, there were half a million successful log-ins on the first day," Obama said. "Healthcare.gov works really well now."
Congressional Republicans have expressed outrage at Gruber's remarks, and hearings into his comments are being considered by GOP leaders in both the House and Senate, such as Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.
Now that his Asia/Pacific trip has ended, Obama faces many clashes with Republicans in Congress, who took control of the Senate and added to their House majority in the midterm election of November 4. Among the flashpoints: the health care law; Obama's expected executive order to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation; growing GOP opposition to his administration's imminent action to limit climate change, and the possibility of a government shutdown when current government funding expires in December.
