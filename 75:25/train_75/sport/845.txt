America's Cup 2013: New Zealand skipper defeat is 'very hard to swallow'
9:18AM BST 26 Sep 2013
Emirates Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker lamented that they couldn't finish off the job, having been on match point for so long.
"I'm gutted that we didn't get the last win that we needed to take this cup back to New Zealand and it's just very hard to swallow." he said.
The New Zealand team were leading until two weeks ago, when Team Oracle USA began a dramatic comeback after adjusting their boat and bringing in Sir Ben Ainslie as tactician.
"You know they've really done an amazing job to sort their boat out and its probably a good thing for us that they didn't do it earlier," Barker said.
Team Oracle USA beat Emirates Team New Zealand by just 44-seconds in the last race to win the America's Cup 9-8.
