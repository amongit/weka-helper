Three-time champion Rafael Nadal overcame an error-strewn start to beat American Donald Young 6-4 6-2 and reach the last 16 at Indian Wells.
The Spanish third seed will play France's Gilles Simon in round four.
"It's true that I had a few mistakes. I was able to find solutions," said Nadal. "I've played a lot of good tournaments here, good results."
Second seed Roger Federer beat Andreas Seppi 6-3 6-4 and will face Jack Sock, the world number 58, in the last 16.
Federer had lost to the Italian at the Australian Open in January, and admitted: "It absolutely was an opportunity right away to play him again and sort of erase it to some extent from the memory as the season moves forward.
"It's one of those matches you're happy you're through, and I was happy it was over."
Sixth seed Milos Raonic beat Alexandr Dolgopolov 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 and ninth seed Tomas Berdych saw off Steve Johnson 6-4 6-2, while 17th seed Tommy Robredo upset ninth seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 1-6 7-5.
Britain's Andy Murray, seeded four at the BNP Paribas Open, will attempt to reach the quarter-finals when he plays Frenchman Adrian Mannarino at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday.
