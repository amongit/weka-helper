Retirement is a relief - Ricky Hatton
Former two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton looks back at the highs and lows of his 47-fight career, including beating Kostya Tszyu for the IBF light welterweight title and losing to Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas in 2009.
Hatton has not fought since his IBO light-welterweight world title defeat by Pacquiao and was stripped of his licence to box in 2010 following allegations about use of cocaine.
Despite talk of a comeback in the interim, the 32-year-old now admits it is "a bit of a relief" to finally confirm his retirement.
