All of the Australian Olympic team competing at future Olympic Games, including next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi, will have to sign a declaration stating they have had no history of doping in sport. If any athletes - or team support staff - are later found to have lied on the document, they could be imprisoned for five years.
The Australian Olympic Committee said it won't select anybody in the Olympic team who fails to make the declaration.
AOC president John Coates first proposed the tough measures in the wake of the Lance Armstrong's confession to extensive and systemised drug taking over more than a decade but the move to ensure teh Sochi Winter Olympians sign the document will help restore Australia's battered reputation.
Australia is the first country to insist on the legal declarations and is seen as a way of weeding out anybody with a corrupt past.
Coates has long lobbied the Australian politicians to institute investigative powers to legally prosecute people involved in trafficking and taking of performance enhancing drugs.

The Australian Federal Government is now in the process of implementing a Sports Anti-Doping
Amendment Bill to give greater investigative powers and the possibility of civil penalties for non-co-operation.
But the Australian stance has been criticised by the World Anti Doping Agency president John Fahey.
Fahey, who is an Australian said the document could encourage a ''cone of silence'' about drug use.
"To sign a declaration under the Oaths Act, which carries with it some pretty severe penalties in our legal system, to indicate they are not doping and never have doped, I worry a bit about that," Fahey said on Tuesday.
"The intention is very good, they want clean athletes representing the Australian community and I think all of us who are Australians think that's a good idea.
"But it seems to me that when you require that sort of thing to be done you're effectively pulling down that cone of silence straight away.
"Will people find themselves in a position where: 'I've just been selected to represent my country in the Olympics. If I say that three years ago I did this, or I did that, they'd send me out of the team. My sporting life is over.'
"You step over the line at that point, or you stay behind the line, and you can never recover. And I just worry about the way this will be reflected in the future.
"I think the last thing we would want to see is the cone of silence, which has been seen in cycling, come in in other areas.
