England's current plight resembles a "soap opera", according to former captain Michael Vaughan.
The team are in disarray after making an early exit from the World Cup, leading to speculation that coach Peter Moores could be sacked.
Selectors have also been criticised by Alastair Cook for dropping him as one-day captain and are also under pressure to clarify Kevin Pietersen's future.

Kevin Pietersen not in our plans - James Whitaker
Vaughan said the situation was so dire it was worth someone making "a movie."
It has been a difficult 10 days for England, which began with their elimination from the World Cup courtesy of a 15-run defeat by Bangladesh.
Test skipper Cook has since said that he should not have been replaced two months before the start of the event.
Meanwhile, Pietersen, who was sacked by England in February last year, has revealed his desire to earn a recall to the national side.
Selector James Whitaker has subsequently stated that the 34-year-old is "not in our plans", despite incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves admiting he has spoken to Pietersen about a return.
Vaughan does not believe the South African-born batsman will make an imminent return: "I don't think Pietersen has a cat in hell's chance of playing for England under the current management.
"James Whitaker is right to say he is not in his plans at the minute, but what if England play poorly and continue to play in the fashion they have throughout the winter?
"They haven't played good cricket - there has been poor selections and poor strategies - and that is down to the management and the coaches."

Vaughan thinks the forthcoming tour to the West Indies could help the current England management out of a hole.
"If there had been a six-to-eight-week break, there might have been a chance to change some things," he said. "But because it is a quick turnaround, they can go with the same management and see how they perform in the West Indies.
"But it is a banana skin. Playing away from home is difficult in Test match cricket. If England play poorly, who is to say in May that the new chairman comes in and there might be a change in management.
"If Pietersen is scoring county runs, a new man might fancy a bit of Pietersen in the middle order. It is a long shot but why not leave that open?"
Vaughan says Cook's criticism of the selectors for dropping him as one-day captain is "staggering".
"England were number one in the world and they got to the Champions Trophy final, but that was two years ago," said Vaughan.
Cook's last ODI century was in June 2012
"The only series they have won in the last two years has been away from home in the Caribbean when Cook wasn't the captain."
However, Vaughan thinks the way the England management dealt with Cook'ss sacking was wrong.
"We knew Alastair Cook was losing the job as one-day captain before Alastair Cook did," said Vaughan. "How does that happen? It is terrible management.
"There are leaks coming left, right and centre from the England and Wales Cricket Board. That has to stop."
