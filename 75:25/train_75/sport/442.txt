Test Match polo for the England team will return to Hurlingham Park for the first time since 1939, on June 5, as part of Chestertons Polo In The Park three-day event.
England's opposition when they play at the spiritual home of English polo is due to be announced later in the spring for the Friday evening match.
Chestertons Polo in the Park started seven years ago
The Test match has been officially sanctioned by the Hurlingham Polo Association (HPA) under its 'City Polo' rules.

"It's fantastic that Polo In The Park has created the opportunity to stage an international polo match at the place here modern polo's rules were first formalised in 1875," said Ollie Hughes, deputy chief executive at the sport's governing body in England.
Polo ceased at Hurlingham Park at the start of World War II, when the pitches were used as army quarters and allotments. After the war, the polo fields were compulsorily purchased from the Hurlingham Club by London County Council and developed into new housing and a public sports ground, for athletics, rugby and football, which is still used today.
Rory Heron, MD of Polo In The Park, explained: “We have been working hard on having an England International at Chestertons Polo in the Park for a long time and I am so thrilled that we have finally managed to achieve it.
"It is fantastic to give so many people, who wouldn’t normally get the chance, the opportunity to watch world class polo right on their doorstep. We have scheduled the match to take place on Friday evening so that people can come and cheer on England straight from work.”
Polo in the Park will be played at Hurlingham for first time in 2015
Chestertons Polo in the Park started seven years ago, with its aim of bringing world class polo right into the heart of London. Played under simplified rules and on a smaller playing field, it has taken polo to a brand new audience and is a feature in London’s sporting summer calendar.
Heron believes the addition of an England International match to the already high calibre of polo at the three-day event will propel it to new heights as one of the leading polo events in the world. The round-robin style tournament is played under the HPA-endorsed City Polo rules, developed to maximise spectator enjoyment.
Polo in the Park, sponsored by Chestertons the estate agents and residential property consultants, is part of the global City Polo Series. Other events owned and managed by Sportgate International include Singapore Concours d'Elegance, Snow Polo Davos and Polo in Paradise.
The park may summon up memories for many. The Monty Python sketch "The 127th Upper Class Twit of the Year Competition from Hurlingham Park" was filmed there in 1969.
