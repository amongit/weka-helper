Britain's Heather Watson won the second WTA Tour title of her career on Saturday, beating American qualifier Madison Brengle in the Hobart International.
Watson recovered from 3-1 down in the first set to win 6-3, 6-4 and complete an ideal week of preparation for the Australian Open, which gets under way on Monday.
The 22-year-old won her maiden title in Osaka at the end of the 2012 season, ending a 24-year wait for a British female champion on the main tour, and bounced back from an injury-blighted 2013 by climbing back into the top 50 last season.
The world No 49 meets Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova in the opening round in Melbourne and her win in Hobart should will see her rise close to her career-best ranking of 39 from February 2013.
Meanwhile, Britain's Kyle Edmund produced a superb battling performance to reach the main draw of the Australian Open for the first time on Saturday, but compatriot Liam Broady fell at the final hurdle in Melbourne.
Order of play, day five
Edmund qualifies for Aussie Open
Murray in a hurry to regain fear factor in Melbourne
Federer looks the man to beat
Edmund came from a set down against local favourite Dane Propoggia to win 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 9-7 after Broady had lost in straight sets to American Michael Russell in the last round of qualifying.
British No 3 Edmund joins James Ward and Andy Murray in the tournament proper, which gets under way on Monday.
Edmund will take on American Steve Johnson on Tuesday, a player who is ranked 39th in the world - 153 places above Edmund.
Murray will take on another qualifier in India's world No 314 Yuki Bhambri in the first round.
