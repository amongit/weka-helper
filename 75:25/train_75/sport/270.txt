British badminton sets out mixed doubles assault as Chris Adcock and Gabby White lead the lines

Leading the lines will be Chris Adcock, who will be reunited with fiancee Gabby White from January.
Adcock needed a new partner after Imogen Bankier quit the GB Badminton programme last month to base herself in her native Scotland. The pair won a world silver last year but fell short of their potential in the Olympics.
Following several high-profile retirements, there remains a youthful outlook. Adcock, 23, and White, 22, have enjoyed previous success together at junior level - winning world silver in 2007 - and also won last year's English national title.
Jens Grill, GB Badminton Performance Director, said “We have enjoyed a very strong start to the new international circuit season with regard all of our doubles pairs.
"We believe the new line up gives us a solid platform on which to establish world class mixed doubles partnerships and continue to build for Rio.”
