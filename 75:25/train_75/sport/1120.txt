Surfers took to the water in southern California, US to take advantage of a huge swell generated by Hurricane Marie on Wednesday.
Waves reached as high as 20ft in Newport Beach, a renowned surf hot spot.
The National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory, warning that the swell - described as the largest in a decade - would cause dangerous rip tides and possible flooding.
