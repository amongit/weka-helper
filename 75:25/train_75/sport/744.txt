Canada win gold: game report
CANADA 3 SWEDEN 0 Third period
FULL TIME
Canada win the gold medal! They become the first team to retain the Olympic title in 26 years too. The Swedish fans have a face on, the Canadians look ecstatic. I'd stay but there's livebloggin' afoot elsewhere and the BBC have stopped their coverage.
Thanks very much for sticking with me through this. Be sure to join me later for the closing ceremony. Until then, bye!
1 min Nash has a chance from the centre but Lundqvist saves. This game started pretty evenly but from the moment Canada went ahead they've been dominant and since Crosby scored the second it's been a foregone conclusion.
2 min "Stay of execution"
phrase of stay
1.
a delay in carrying out a court order.
"the prisoner was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court"
4 min As is the fashion du jour at sporting events, Daft Punk booms over the PA. 'One More Time', electropop fans.
6 min Sweden come forward but Canada's defensive unit is an unrelenting beast.
7 min Another giveaway in their own defensive zone and this time Nash fancies it. He shoots wide as well. Sweden are done.
8 min Edler gives it away and Benn skates clear. Can he get his third of the tournament? No, it grazes the post on the short side.
9 min Canada concede a penalty for tripping, Perry taking it. Can Sweden find a way to score the three they need, against a side who have conceded three all tournament? No, no they cannot. We resume and Benn gives it to Bergeron and Erik Karlsson makes a last-ditch block.
10 min Goal! Kunitz with the goal. Given away by Sweden on the blue line and he rips a violent shot off the bar and in. Game over. Weber almost adds the fourth from the blue line but it's cleared after a scramble.
11 min Another long-range shot from Nash and it takes Lundqvist by surprise, the New York Ranger juggling the shot from his NHL teammate.
13 min Sweden's passing is falling apart. Shea Weber is taking them apart with his interceptions.
14 min Toews spins behind the goal and tees up Doughty for the shot from just inside the blue line, which Lundqvist saves. They go on the wrap around again but Sweden hold out.
15 min Not a lot is happening. Berglund shoots high into the stands via someone's stick.
17 min Karlsson gives it away in his own defense zone to Dechene and he tries to play Nash in. Can't get there then Doughty comes in and shoots from the right, hits the post!
18 min Sweden look to loop around again but with three men behind the goal they have to skate back quick to stop Toews.
19 min We have an early face off, 12 seconds in as the puck loops off a stick and into the stands. Sweden win it and they loop around but it's given away and Toews makes the break this time. Carter looks to tip in and Lundqvist saves well. Hagelin comes away down the left and gets a shot on goal, which Price saves.
13.44 Here we go again.
13.43 Here's an email from Dan Hamilton in Toronto, clearing a few things up:
Danno. How’s it goin’, eh? Greetings from Canada where a 6 am face off forces a nation to face the dilemma of what morning beer goes best with back bacon and eggs at breakfast. When the puck sails toward the top part of the goal, it’s not ‘top deck’. It’s top shelf. But appreciate your effort. If someone whips one in upstairs, impress us all by calling it a ‘cheese snipe’. If it’s a strong enough cheese snipe to dislodge the goalie’s water bottle holstered atop the net, then it’s a ‘bottle popper’. Crosby’s goal came off a ‘deke’ to his backhand. If he’d had to work the puck around a couple of players to advance on goal, that would have been a ‘dangle’. Toews’ goal was off a ‘tip-in’.
You guys don't really say "eh", do you?
END OF SECOND PERIOD
48 sec Jimmy Erikssen comes away one on three and shoots miles off-target.
1 min As we run the clock down, here's the first goal:

2 min Kunitz is down and the whistle goes even though Canada have possession. Ooh it's a penalty against Berglund for boarding. He smashed into Kunitz from behind and the Candian's face smashed into the top of the gate. If he's only got a broken nose he's lucky, that was brutal.
3 min It's hard to see a way back for Sweden against this awesome Canada side. That's Crosby first goal of the tournament, by the way.
4 min Goal! That should be that! Erikssen gives it away in the centre and, disatrously, gives it away to Crosby. The world's best player comes forward unchallenged, skates round Lundqvist and scores!
5 min Sweden are buckling now. Toews shooting wide. Canada are looking to kill this game off and the World Champions can barely get the puck. Oh but now a brilliant save by Price as the puck is deflected towards his top deck and he changes direction to clutch it.
6 min Benn again down the left and he has Perry to his right but Sedin gets back and takes it off him.
7 min Mistake in the middle of the ice by Sweden and now Canada swarm the goal and once again Lundqvist is forced to keep his team in it.
8 min Extreme pressure from Canada now as Nash looks to shoot from the inside right. It's saved but suddenly Lundqvist is flat on his back and there's an almighty scramble. Now Carter goes in and Lundqvist, under siege, thinks he's being slashed. Actually that was some stunning goalkeeping.
9 min Sweden knock it down into the corner but Doughty gets there first and gives it to Perry; suddenly he and Benn have a two-on-one. It's saved by Lundqvist from the snap shot.
10 min The Soviet Union were the last team to retain the Olympic title, back in 1988. What ever happened to them?
Crosby comes through the middle but it's touched off the end of his stick by a defenceman. Crosby loses his helmet and has to go off the ice.
11 min Loui Eriksson has a chance but it's blocked and Perry and St. Louis bring it away. A lot of ice time for St. Louis here, which suggests that maybe there are injury concerns over Bergeron.
12 min Oduya with a great intercept as Canada attack one last time and the penalty is killed.
13 min Shot from the blue line hits Kruger and puts him on his knees. Perry then fires a shot from point-blank range over and into the plexiglass. That was a poor shot, he really should have scored.
14 min It's three on two for Canada and it comes left for Carter who shoots one time and it's saved. Penalty against Sweden here, although it's unclear why.
15 min Nash down the left and it's back across for St. Louis. It's a great chance but his shot is weak and though it goes through the legs of Lundqvist the puck doesn't reach goal. That was poor from both forward and netminder there.
16 min Steen comes down the left and shoots on the backhand but it goes wide. There's nothing for the Swedes through the middle. "It's like them having to skate through maple syrup," the BBC man actually says.
17 min Twice Sidney Crosby is dumped on to the ice within a matter of seconds.
18 min One last chance and Karlsson goes top deck, but it's saved and Canada survive.
19 min Karlsson plays it wide from the blue line and it comes in for Alfredsson. Cleared as far as Sedin wide on the right and he knocks it in for Steen, but Nash gets it away. Canada close to surviving the powerplay.
12.43 Isn't Jonathan Edwards rocking those glasses on the BBC? Wait, what?

7 sec Alfredson fires one in but it's saved and that's it for the first period. Canada are on top but it's defense v defense here. Think England v Ireland in yesterday's Six Nations, just, you know, in hockey form.
26 sec Canada are running the clock down but there's a penalty coming. It's Kunitz for high sticking and Sweden will start the second period with 5 v 4.
1 min Huge shot from Weber from range but it's right at Lundqvist.
2 min Saint-Louis crosses it off the backhand side. Scrambled away but Crosby is there. These two making a potent attacking threat.
3 min Eventually Sweden clear but they are straining under the penalty. They survive the powerplay, surprisingly comfortably against a team of Canada's quality.
4 min Ericsson (Jimmy) is being hemmed in here. He's looking to clear but Canada's defencemen are harrying him in his own defensive zone, wide on the right up against the fence.
5 min Couple of chances for Duchene but he can't take them. Not to worry, powerplay to Canada as the giant Jonathan Ericsson takes a penalty for holding. Here's a picture of some action.

6 min So Canada, so strong in defence, have a 1-0 lead and will probably look to Mourinho it from here, shutting down and protecting their lead. Still, if anyone can beat them it'll be Sweden and as they come through again Price saves well.
7 min Goal! It's tapped in by Toews for his first of the tournament after Weber put it in from the right. Poacher's finish, in football parlance.
8 min Patrice Bergeron, who has looked dangerous so far, snaps a shot off the post via the goalie's stick for Canada. Now Sidin brings it away and Kruger shoots high into the meshing.
10 min Burst down the left by Edler and his centre is scrambled clear. Back in it comes for Karlsson but he can't force it past Price in the scramble.
11 min Perry goes through the middle and passes left to Ben, but the forward misses the puck entirely as he looks to hit the one time shot. This hasn't been the most exciting start.
12 min Back underway then after a brief pause to clean the ice. Sweden enjoying possession beyond the blue line but they're being pressed wide and unable to really get a shot off. Canada break but the puck is fired into mesh.
13 min It's actually Sweden's defence that's on top here. After a fast start Crosby is getting shut down and Canada, even when they have possession in the offensive zone, are being handled with ease.
14 min Snap shot from the blue line and Canada are on the back foot... er, skate, here.
16 min Crosby is on fire out there. Well not literally, that wouldn't be great for the ice rink. But he's showing why he's the world's most creative player by making a couple of great chances from the left, neither of which Bergeron can convert. Oh but now Sweden come forward, there's a goalmouth scramble and the Swedes look for all the world to have scored, but it comes straigt back off the post and Price smothers it!
17 min A good start for Canada then but Sweden come back well. Kronwald has it in acres of space on the left but can't get his shot past Price.
19 min Here we go then. Sweden are in yellow, Canada red. Obviously. Price makes the first save from Sedin who slapped a left-handed shot stick-side into the glove. Sweden win the face off but Crosby gets it back and sends it up to the offensive zone. Sweden can't clear and there's a chance for Bergerin. It's blocked but comes back in again and Lundquist eventually makes the save.
12.09 The players are out on the ice now. Does Mike Babcock have the most Canadian name ever?
12.04 This is the last gold medal event of what will be the last ever Winter Olympics before man-made global climate change eliminates the concept of Winter forever in four years time.
12.01 It looks like the BBC are going to allow this match to grace the actual TV rather than lead us to use the online stream. Funnily enough they didn't do this for the women's gold medal match, showing a recap of the curling instead. Good work, BBC.
12.00 Er, it's not started yet.
11.49 So how did these two teams get here? Well Sweden swept all before them, winning every match so far and not looking particularly troubled at any point. Canada were seeded second after the preliminary games, finishing with 8 points to Sweden's 9 as they needed OT to beat Finland. The fact that they had Finland in their group though tells us that their route to the final has in fact been trickier; Sweden's closest challengers were decent-but-unfancied Switzerland.
Canada have surprised us all by building their game on defence. They have the second-best goaltender in the games so far in Carey Price, who has conceded just three goals in 242:32 minutes on the ice, with a goals-against average of 0.74 per game, although Henrik Ludqvist, his opposite number today, has a not-too-shabby 117 saves to his name albeit with six goals against in the 300 minutes he's played - that's every second so far he's been on the ice, maths* fans.
That high number of goals conceded - over one per game - for a team that's won every match so far tells you one thing about Sweden: they love to attack. Erik Karlsson sits second behind Phil Kessel of the USA in the leading scorers charts: four goals, four assists and not a single penalty to his name. Even if you haven't been watching up to now, the stats should tell you that this afternoon we'll most likely see Canada try and hit the Swedes on the counter as they did so effectively against the USA.
Dan's prediction is 2-1 to Sweden. Am I way out on that? We begin in ten minutes.
*Or "math", for our readers across the pond.
11.20 Afternoon all. In a poetic parallel universe, this is a Cold War grudge rematch between the USA and Russia. Right here though it isn't after the former lost out narrowly to Canada and the latter were dumped out by Finland, so instead it's what this should be: the World Champions against the Olympic Champions. The number one-ranked side in the world against the bookies' favourites. OK the names might lack the box office glamour of Rocky IV: On Ice, but it's the final this tournament deserves: it's Canada v Sweden.
