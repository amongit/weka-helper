His compatriot Jongjit has also been suspended for three months by the Badminton World Federation for his part in the incident, which occurred during last month's Canada Open in Richmond, British Columbia.
The BWF has taken a hard line after footage of the extraordinary incident during the men's doubles final spread quickly via the internet.
A statement from the BWF read: "Thailand player, Bodin Issara, has been suspended for two years from all tournaments sanctioned by the Badminton World Federation while his compatriot, Maneepong Jongjit, has received a three-month ban.
"This decision by the BWF's disciplinary committee follows the two players' involvement in an altercation while competing against each other in the men's doubles final of last month's Yonex Canada Open.
"Both sanctions are effective from the date of the incident – Sunday July 21 – and the players have 21 days in which to appeal.

"In addition, Issara will forfeit the world-ranking points and prize money earned from the said event."

Issara was seen chasing Jongjit around the arena and then raining several blows to his body after catching up with him.
The pair, who reached the quarter-finals at the London 2012 Olympics together, were competing against each other having ended their partnership earlier this year.
The referee warned both players following a verbal exchange early in the match but troubled flared again during a change of ends.
Issara, 22, was found guilty of five breaches of the BWF's code of conduct relating to inappropriate conduct, oral abuse, physical abuse, unsportsmanlike conduct and conduct contrary to the integrity of the game.
Jongjit, who was alleged to have hit Issara with his racket early in the confrontation, was found to have breached the sections on inappropriate conduct, oral abuse and unsportsmanlike conduct.
While both players have been given 21 days to appeal against the sanction they have already been hit by bans of similar lengths by the Badminton Association of Thailand.
