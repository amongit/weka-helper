London 2012 Olympics: Nick Woodbridge to consider his future after 10th in modern pentathlon

Devised by Baron Pierre de Coubertin himself and making its debut at the Games exactly 100 years ago, it features fencing, swimming, horse riding, running and shooting, all in one day.
Coubertin intended it to reflect the experience of a soldier behind enemy lines during the Napoleonic Wars; contemporary viewers may regard it as a high-budget version of It’s A Knockout.
Britain, as with many sports invented elsewhere, has historically been pretty useless at it, on the men’s side at least. Not in a century of modern pentathlon has an athlete from this country won a medal of any colour in the individual men’s event, which has traditionally been dominated by eastern Europe.
Yesterday evening, Nick Woodbridge and Sam Weale continued the barren run, finished 10th and 13th respectively. David Svoboda of the Czech Republic won gold, Cao Zhongrong of China silver, Adam Marosi of Hungary bronze.
A disappointed Woodbridge said he would consider his future in the sport.

He had finished third in the test event here last year and went into the combined run and shoot, the final event, with an outside chance of a medal.
But having given his all over 11 gruelling hours, the 26-year-old from Telford was left ruing a number of missed opportunities.
“Halfway through the fence I was in the top five,” he said. “I thought this was going to be my day, with a solid swim to come. Then it all fell apart. I was more worried about losing than trying to win.
“I would like to go to Rio if I think I can progress, but I don’t think I want to carry on if I’m not going to improve. I don’t want to be continually finishing 5th or 10th. That doesn’t really mean anything to me.
"I’d rather retire. So I’ll speak to my coaches and if they think I can improve, I’ll go to Rio. If they don’t, I’ll probably retire.”
With his economics degree, the option of finding gainful employment, rather than living off lottery handouts, is certainly open to him. “I’m 26 now. If I continue I’ll be 30, and you’ve got to start thinking about your career, because you certainly don’t get enough cash to sort out your future life.”
The fencing consisted of 35 one-minute bouts at the Copper Box in the Olympic Park. Woodbridge finished it in joint 13th place, after winning 17 and losing 18. Next came his strongest event, the 200 metres freestyle swimming at the Aquatics Centre, and although he posted the second fastest time of 1:57.32, it was still three seconds short of what he was aiming for. The competitors headed south of the river to Greenwich Park for the final two events.
Woodbridge was dealt a rum hand in the showjumping, in which riders were randomly paired with horses and given only 20 minutes to practise before their round. Organisers had pledged to avoid a repeat of Beijing four years ago, which saw dozens of refusals and several falls on an array of clearly inexperienced mounts. But though the horses at London 2012 had gone through a rigorous selection process, some were clearly more able than others.
Pity Hwang Woo-jin of South Korea, whose horse Shearwater Oscar threw him off and bolted before he had even started his round. With the clock already running, Hwang set off in pursuit and managed to clamber aboard, only for Shearwater Oscar to then kick over virtually every fence. There was warm applause for Hwang, but with 464 jumping and time penalties his Olympic dream was over.
Woodbridge, a skilled rider who first rode a horse at the age of three and was a member of the Pony Club by age 12, was sitting on a jittery ticking time-bomb called Umberto de Fauquez. But after a superb display, with just one fence dislodged and six seconds of time penalties, he was seventh going into the final event, Weale was a place behind.
The combined run/shoot was handicapped based on the standings. Leader Svoboda went out first, with Cao just a second behind him. Woodbridge, a strong runner, lost time on both the first and second shooting ranges, but rallied strongly on the final run to claim a top-10 finish.
The uncertainty over Woodbridge’s future mirrors that over the sport as a whole. It survived a crunch vote over its future in 2005, and faces another one next year, when the International Olympic Committee will cut one sport from the programme.
But the spectacle was certainly an entertaining one, if at times during the showjumping inadvertently so, and was attended by a capacity crowd. Similar numbers are expected today for the women’s event, in which Britain could claim their final gold medal of game. Mhairi Spence is the current world champion and world number two, with fellow Briton Samantha Murray another strong medal shout.
