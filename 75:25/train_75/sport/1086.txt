22.05 South Africa hoof the ball into touch and that's it! New Zealand have been beaten for the first time ever in the Commonwealth Games and South Africa win gold! That's all from me folks. Thanks for reading over the past three days. G'night.
22.04 Oh New Zealand knock on in midfield with seconds to go! South Africa have the scrum as the hooter goes. Next time it goes dead...
22.02 It's not over yet. O'Donnell goes down the right flank and offloads inside to Webber, who rides the tackle and crosses. 17-12 as Kaka misses the conversion.
22.00 And another! The wonderfully named Cecil Afrika picks up the loose ball and sprints into the corner from 70m to make it 17-7.
21.56 Oh I say! Three minutes into the second half and Senatla loops round on the outside to score in the right-hand corner. 12-7.
21.51 South Africa eventually take advantage of the extra man and Senatla finds a way through to go between the posts on the stroke of half time. Afrika converts and it's 7-7 at the break. Ten minutes to go.
21.47 Yellow card for New Zealand's Bryce Heem, for petulantly booting the ball away. That was dumb.
21.44 New Zealand score first as Lam breaks, gives it to Forbes and the captain offloads inside to Stowers who jogs under the sticks. Kaka converts for 7-0.
21.42 We're having a long break here as one of the South African players is down injured. It's the captain Brown and he's back on his feet, but has a bad looking shoulder injury.
<noframe>Twitter: Kolose Feaunati - Unlucky <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Samoa7s" target="_blank">@Samoa7s</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SamoaRugby" target="_blank">@SamoaRugby</a> 7s you've done Samoa proud well done to Dickie also, will go well as 7s coach <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23RugbySevens" target="_blank">#RugbySevens</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23CommonwealthGames" target="_blank">#CommonwealthGames</a></noframe>
21.38 South Africa kick-off. The final is an extended match: ten minutes each way rather than seven.
21.37 Here we go. Australia have won bronze thanks to a comprehensive 24-0 win over Samoa.
21.30 36 hours of liveblogging these Commonwealth Games are coming to an end for me and we're going out with what, to me, is the pinnacle of Glasgow 2014: the rugby sevens final. The two best teams in the world, New Zealand and South Africa, are going up against each other for the gold medal that's arguably generated the most interest in the wider sport community.
New Zealand, who a few years ago finally embraced the All Blacks name, have never lost a match in the history of the Commonwealth Games, going back 16 years. Their performances this year haven't been their best ever, but their mix of attacking verve and defensive strength is easily the most impressive we've seen. They did for Scotland and for Australia, if not with ease then clinically. South Africa on the other hand have faced nothing like such a test and have breezed through to the final.
If South Africa win this then it'll be akin to the time that Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros with his dragons and roasted Harren the Black alive in his hitherto impenetrable castle of Harrenhal, back in the prehistory of "A Song of Ice and Fire" and I bet you didn't expect that Game of Thrones reference in your Commonwealth Games liveblog did you?
21.29 The men's 4x200m freestyle relay has been won, unsurprisingly, by Australia, with Scotland picking up silver and South Africa bronze.
21.11 Time for a break for me. I'll be back in around 25 minutes for the rugby final.
21.08 Halsall, the fastest qualifier, starts well with Vanderpool-Wallace of the Bahamas on her tail. Fran Halsall is too strong though and picks up another gold for England.
21.07 So this now is the last of the realistic British medal hopes tonight: Fran Halsall of England in the women's 50m butterfly. For the record, Amy Smith, her team-mate, is also in this race.
21.04 We're underway and Treffers powers ahead, right from the off. His compatriot Mitch Larkin and Liam Tancock are both with him but the two Australians pull clear and Treffers takes it by 0.13 seconds from Larkin. Tancock, the world record holder, gets bronze with Chris Walker-Hebborn fourth.
21.00 We're going to finish our night in the pool. First up, the men's 50m backstroke final in which English hopes rest on Chris Walker-Hebborn and Liam Tancock. Wales are represented by Marco Loughran, but he's not expected to be a serious contender for a medal. Can either of them match Siobhan O'Connor's achievements earlier tonight?

20.58 Aye, that it was:
<noframe>Twitter: bengrier. - Cracking game of rugby sevens!</noframe>
England win 17-15 and take home the plate.
20.56 The hooter goes with the score still 15-12 to Wales and England have the ball. There's a break and it goes right... and Burgess slides over in the corner for the winning try!
20.49 15-12 now with five minutes or so to play thanks to Watson's brilliant try, but Bibby, who has taken over the kicking duties from the injured Lewis-Pratt, bloots his restart both (a) out on the full and (b) backwards.
20.45 Great first half from Wales. They've outscored England three tries to one and lead 15-7 at the break. There's no medal for this match, but the winner does get a nice shiny plate and it looks like it's going to reside west of the Severn after another seven minutes of these sevens.
20.38 The rugby sevens plate final has kicked off. Wales v England; it's no Cardiff on Six Nations day, but there's enough of a rivalry there to make this an interesting one.
20.26 Some qualifiers for various finals. Adam Barrett and almost certainly James Guy, both of England, are into the final of the men's 100m butterfly where they will go up against the might Chad le Clos. In squash, Laura Massaro is into the final against the defending champion Nicol David.
20.18 Here's Erraid Davies on her way to a history-making bronze medal just a few minutes ago. When I was 13 my sporting prowess amounted to not being able to hit the strip in a nets session at Northants County Cricket Ground.

20.13 O'Connor leads by a body length on the penultimate leg and extends the lead on Coutts at the turn. It's a brilliant swim from the 18-year-old and she's leaving the competition trailing in her wake. Gold for Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, silver for Coutts, bronze for the home favourite Hannah Miley.
20.11 A couple of minutes leater than expected we're beginning the final of the women's 200m individual medley. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor of England and Hannah Miley of Scotland looking like Britain's best medal hopes. Alicia Coutts is the one to beat though.
20.06 The women's para-sport 100m breaststroke SB9 final featuring 13-year-old Erraid Davies, the youngest Scottish entrant in the Games' history... and remarkably she's won a bronze medal! What a result this is!
19.49 Sprenger of Australia is out in front at the start with Murdoch catching him fast, but its Peaty who finishes strongest and wins the semi in 26.99.
19.46 Adam Peaty and Ross Murdoch, two of the big medal hopes for Britain in the 50m breaststroke, will line-up next to each other in lanes four and five in the second semi-final...
19.43 In the first semi Cameron van der Burgh comes in first, 0.13 seconds short of his own world record and setting a new games record, beating Adam Peaty's from this morning. Mark Tully of Scotland is third.
19.37 Fran Halsall is into the final of the women's 100m freestyle. We'll find out in five minutes or so if Adam Peaty can make the final of the men's 50m breaststroke.
19.35 We've got a cracker of a final in the sevens then, coming up at 9.37pm. Which means it's all over far, far too soon for my liking.
<noframe>Twitter: Rugby World - It's over in the second Commonwealth semi-final - South Africa slap a 35-7 defeat on Samoa. So we have a thriller of a final: NZ versus SA</noframe>
19.23 It's also gold for the Aussies at the velodrome (where do we stand on simply calling it "The 'drome" by the way?) in the men's keiren, with Matthew Glaetzer snatching a photo-finish win ahead of Kiwi Sam Webster and Mohd Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia.
19.21 It's another gold for Australia. James Magnussen winning the men's 100m freestyle. Adam Brown and fellow Englishman James Disney-May were in the race, but finished sixth and eighth respectively.
At Ibrox, South Africa are running away with it with a 35=7 lead.
19.18 Laura Trott, I'm told, won the women's points race in spite of suffering from a kidney infection.
19.17 Half-time in the second semi and South Africa have come from behind to lead Samoa 14-7. In the pool, Belinda Hocking of Australia has won gold in the women's 200m backstroke final. English pair Lizzie Simmonds and Lauren Quigley missing out on the medals.
19.01 An absolutely brilliant finish from Scott Curry with about 20 seconds to go has put New Zealand 19-7 up and out of reach. Indeed once the conversion is kicked the whistle goes and the All Blacks will beat face South Africa or Samoa in the final.
18.53 We've just started the second half of the sevens cup semi-final and it's New Zealand 7-7 Australia. The All Blacks have never lost a Commonwealth Games match. Here's a shot of the successful British triumvirate from the women's points race.

18.43 Up now is the main event: the cup semi-final. New Zealand play Australia and then it's Samoa v South Africa. Shall we see what other major things are on tonight?
- Men's 20km scratch race and kerein finals - Women's 200m backstroke final - Men's 100m freestyle final - Men's 50m backstroke final - Women's 50m butterfly final
18.41 England win! Stuart Hogg sets the turf alight with a blazing run down the left and seems to be haring into the corner, but Norton matches him for pace and smothers him in the tackle. Hogg spills it forward and Norton gets up and welts it into touch. Full time England 15-12 Scotland.
18.35 Turnover 35m out, won by Scott White, and Lee Jones steps inside off his left and dives under the posts. 15-12 to England now and Scotland win the ball from kick-off!
18.34 Scotland are back into this. Bennett went streaking down the right and looked to be in, before Dan Norton came back to make a brilliant tackle and rip the ball off of Mark Bennett. He immediately kills the ball though and Bennett takes a quick tap penalty and dives over. Norton is retrospectively sin-binned too. 15-5.
18.33 As the second half gets underway England go straight on the attack.
Here's quite a cool photo of Laura Trott on her way to victory.

18.29 It's a try on the stroke of half-time for England's Dan Norton that makes it 15-0. The winner of this will play Wales in the plate final, after the Welsh beat Kenya in their semi-final.
In the netball it finished England 41-35 South Africa, which means England are second in the table and on for a semi-final berth.
18.25 It's time for one of the biggest match-ups of the sevens competition now, as England face the hosts Scotland at Ibrox. Tom Powell has just gone over on the right for England's second try to make it 10-0 to England in what has so far been a one-sided plate semi-final.
Jo Edwards of New Zealand has won gold in the women's single bowls.
17.56 Gold for Laura Trott! She comes up with a strong final sprint in the points race to take top spot. Elinor Barker comes second - the top two both finished on 37 points but Trott wins thanks to a better finish in the final stage - while Scotland's Katie Archibald comes in third thanks to a brilliant finish.
In the men's 5000m on the Hampden Park track, Caleb Ndiku wins gold for Kenya.
17.49 Here's Jess Varnish celebrating her bronze medal.

17.44 News from the women's points race and it's good news for Wales, as Elinor Barker moves to the top of the standings.
17.38 Hello all, I'm back after getting a bite to eat. Here's what you missed.
- England's Jess Varnish gets the bronze with a 2-0 win in the women's sprint race - Stephanie Morton easily beats Anna Meares to win gold for Australia - Laura Trott leads the women's points race - England lead South Africa 19-17 at half-time in their must-win netball match
17.10 Disappointing end to the Games for Jason Kenny, who has been defeated in the kerein by his teammate Matthew Crampton right on the line.
17.01 I've just noticed that Nigeria have an entrant in the 400m called Regina George. Not this one, I'm afraid.

16.46 It's another gold for England: Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott winning the women's 1000m time trial B2 tandem to pick up another para-sport win. Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston took silver for Scotland.
16.38 England's women have emulated the success of the men earlier on in the 100m. Sophie Papps, Asha Phillip and Bianca Williams have all qualified for tomorrow's semi-finals along with Northern Ireland's Amy Foster.
16.35 Gold for South Africa, who beat Malaysia 14-9 in the women's fours lawn bowls.
16.29 Minor ripples being caused in the gold medal race in the same event: Morton leads her compatriot Meares 1-0.
16.23 Jess Varnish is representing England in the women's track sprint bronze medal race against Fatehah Mustapa. Mustapa took the first heat, but towards the end Mustapa came out of the sprint lane illegally and has been relegated. 1-0 to Varnish.
16.03 The keirin is underway at the Sir Chris Foy Hoy velodrome. Jason Kenny hasn't had a particularly great games but he's England's big hope here.
16.00 Our own Ben Bloom updates:
<noframe>Twitter: Ben Bloom - Turns out Alan Baby is about as good a cyclist as Stuart Binny is a bowler.</noframe>
For those not au fait with Indian cricket, this means he's rubbish.
15.51 Our own Ben Bloom reports:
<noframe>Twitter: Ben Bloom - India have a track cyclist called Alan Baby. You lose, Stuart Binny.</noframe>
15.49 There's also good news for England in para-sport: Bethy Woodward gets silver in the women's long jump T37/38. Jodi Elkington of Australia gets the gold.
15.43 Good news for England's male sprinters as all three qualify for the semi-finals of the 100m. Adam Gemili, Richard Kilty and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey will all be in action tomorrow evening. Here's Gemili, all smiles as well he might be.

15.30 We're still going through the heats in the men's 100m and the best performance so far has come from England youngster Adam Gemili, who has the fastest time across the heats so far - 10.15.
15.03 It's Steven Scott who wins gold for England in the men's double trap shooting. There's no medal in the bowls for Scotland though, as they're edged out 15-21 by New Zealand in the women's fours.
14.44 England wins gold in the men's double trap shooting! Despite the final being (a) between a French man and a Scott and (b) in the future. But as Steven Scott and Matthew French are both actually English, the prediction seems a safe one.
14.41 I'm also hearing that although Lizzy Armitstead crashed earlier, she will be fine to race in the Commonwealth Games.
14.36 There's a distinctly unsurprising gold for Singapore in the women's team table tennis after they beat Malaysia.
14.31 Incidentally if you're reading this while hoping to get into see the athletics... er, for some reason, Martin emails with bad news:
Don't think the crowd outside will get in for the start ,haven't moved in 1 hour
14.26 We've got a story up now on Charlotte Kerwood's shooting win.
The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal.
Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out.
Read the full story here.
14.15 Receiving news that England's Lizzie Armitstead, who was competing in the women's stage of the Tour de France, crashed on the last lap in Paris today. She is one of the favourites for the Commonwealth Games road race title but she's not seriously injured so she should be fine for Glasgow.
14.05 England Rugby Sevens coach Simon Amor after today's agonising quarter-final defeat to Samoa...
We came here with the mission of winning it and we knew that if we played to our potential we could do that, so of course it is hugely disappointing but that's the way sevens goes. We will take ourselves away, switch off a bit and then put in a performance. We still have a lot to play for - the pride of the shirt and a couple of guys are playing in the sevens shirt for the last time
14.00 A clearly delighted Charlotte Kerwood after winning gold in the double trap... "I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing."

13.34 British Judo Association chairman Kerrith Brown is confident the flood of medals at the Commonwealth Games will serve as a springboard towards the Rio de Janeiro Olympics...
What you can see from the results in Glasgow, with the way that the medals have been spread out, is that probably for the first time in 15 years we have a great unity between the home countries
13.32 Scotland lose 35-12 to South Africa meaning there will be no British teams in the Rugby Sevens semi-finals. However, there will be an all-Southern Hemisphere line-up: New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Samoa
13.29 Quick swimming round-up: Jazz Carlin has set a new Commonwealth Games record in qualifying for Monday night's 800m freestyle final. The Welsh swimmer finished more than 11 seconds ahead of the nearest rival in her heat to touch home in 8:22.69. Miley and fellow Scot Camilla Hattersley were the only other home nations competitors to make the final.
South African Chad le Clos set the fastest time in the 100m butterfly heats in 52.68 seconds, hours after winning the 200m. England's Adam Barret was fourth-fastest while team-mates James Guy and Joe Roebuck also qualified for the semi-finals along with Tom Laxton of Wales and the Isle of Man's Grant Halsall.
Scotland won their men's 4x200m freestyle heat but Australia were more than six seconds faster in the other heat.
13.25 Rugby Sevens quarter-final latest with five minutes to go: South Africa 21-12 Scotland
13.22 Here's how the medal table looks so far (top five):

13.16 Alistair Brownlee has said he is unlikely to pursue track running despite having won every major honour in triathlon...
I think I'm going to struggle now. The track was a goal to try to come to the Commonwealths to do it. It would have been a fantastic achievement to do it but it just didn't work out unfortunately. At the moment I'm completely focused on triathlon, obviously the rest of this year and then on to Rio
13.13 Rhys Williams' failed drugs test has not cast a cloud over the Glasgow 2014 Games, a senior official insisted on Sunday.
Williams, the co-captain of Wales' Commonwealth Games athletics squad, was provisionally suspended on Friday following a failed drugs test and misses the Glasgow Games as a result. The European 400 metres hurdles champion became the second Welsh athlete to be forced out of the Games over an anti-doping rule violation, after 800m runner Gareth Warburton was withdrawn before the Games.
The company behind the Mountain Fuel supplements used by both athletes has launched an investigation to determine whether the product may have had a part in their failed tests.
13.10 And that's the way it finishes, England go out leaving Scotland as Britain's only remaining sevens hope. In the shooting, Rachel Parish has taken bronze for England in the women's double trap.
13.07 A minute to go and it's Samoa 15-14 England.
12.57 England are in action now against Samoa in their quarter-final. As we might have told you before kick-off, it's a very close thing with England leading 7-5 in the first half. They have however lost James Rodwell to the sin-bin for arguing with the official and indeed as I write this, Samoa have gone over in the corner to lead 10-7.
12.46 Oh it's heartbreak for Wales in the sevens! Australia, 19-14 down with the clock on zero, have a penalty on their own 22. They tap and go and get to within a metre of the Welsh line but look to have butchered it. Another penalty is given though and the Australians go under the post; the conversion is welted through and it finishes Wales 19-21 Australia!
12.38 I have a feeling that might be it, as far as things for the hockey players to cheer go though:
<noframe>Twitter: Rod Gilmour - England 5 Malaysia 0. Maddie Hinch didn't have a save to make all game. Aussies next, who have mustered 22 in 3 games. Quaking.</noframe>
12.35 The women's double trap shooting final has just finished and it's gold for England. Charlotte Kerwood is the victor. Australia have pulled it back to 19-7 at half-time in the rugby and England's women have beaten Malaysia 5-0 at hockey.
12.32 On the BBC, Gavin Hastings has suggested that New Zealand sevens player Ben Lam looks like golfer Miguel Angel Jiminez. Not seeing it myself.

We could be in for a shock here too: Wales have just scored their third try to go 19-0 up against Australia, who beat England last night.
12.26 New Zealand beat Kenya 19-7 and go through to the semi-finals.
12.23 Could there be a shock on at Ibrox? New Zealand are only 12-7 up against Kenya with two minutes to... oh no New Zealand have scored again. 17-7 and they should be able to win easily enough from here. Whisper it, but the All Blacks haven't been at their best in these games.
12.19 In the women's team table tennis event, Australia have taken bronze with a nerve-wracking 3-2 win over India. We've also got an email, courtesy of Graham Wilson.
Great atmosphere. Chaotic ticket arrangements and ill informed stewards. Had to send tickets back for opening ceremony supposedly because of building works. Promised upgraded seats. Took three hours on phone to find out what was happening and had to queue an hour for replacement tickets. Tickets were not upgraded they were poorer and our original seats appeared to have been reallocated. Travelled to three venues and been misdirected every time to buses and facilities.
11.59 We also have a result in the women's marathon: Flomena Cheyech Daniel of Kenya has won quite comfortably ahead of her compatriot Caroline Kilel. Australia's Jess Trengrove takes bronze.
11.58 Here's England's Adam Peaty in record-breaking action.

11.52 Right, Rob Bagchi has relieved me from cricket duty, so what have we missed here?
- Scotland's Derek Hawkins came in ninth place in the marathon, with England's Stephen Way - who seven years ago weighed 16 stone and smoked 20 cigarettes a day - finished in a very impressive 10th. - Northern Ireland have beaten Wales 20-12 in the men's triples lawn bowls. - Johnny Belis, the Manx cyclist, has withdrawn from the Games injured - England's women lead Malaysia 2-0 at half-time in the hockey - Barbados's heartwarming sevens campaign is coming to a close as they trail the Cook Islands 31-7 with about 20 seconds left.
11.35 Hannah Miley gives the Scottish crowd more to cheer as she wins her heat in the women's 200m individual medley. England's Siobhan O'Connor also qualifies comfortably.
11.23 England's Adam Peaty has followed up his gold medal in the 100 metres breaststroke with a Commonwealth Games record in the 50m event. The 19-year-old swam 27 seconds flat to beat world-record holder Cameron van der Burgh by 0.39secs.
Scotland's 200m gold medallist Ross Murdoch won his heat ahead of Australian Christian Sprenger in 27.44. Fellow Scots Mark Tully and Joe Welstead were also in the top seven while Welshman Rob Holderness, England's James Wilby and Michael Dawson of Northern Ireland all made tonight's semi-finals.
Earlier, English pair Lizzie Simmonds and Lauren Quigley both qualified for the 200m backstroke final.
Simmonds, who came fifth in the 100m final, was the second-fastest qualifier behind Canada's Hilary Caldwell, who swam 2:09.47, while British champion Quigley was four seconds slower as she grabbed the final place in a race that will include three Australians and three Canadians.
11.17 It's marathon gold for Michael Shelley on the streets of Glasgow. The Aussie missed out four years ago and had to settle for silver, but now he raises his arms in delight and is crowned the Commonwealth Games champion.
11.13 Scotland have won the bowls against England16-15. They've lost their netball match though, 26-68 to Jamaica. Michael Shelley of Australia has taken gold in the men's marathon.
10.57 We've had an email from Ian Beaumont on last night's sevens match between England and Australia. I hate to admit this, but I was actually in bed by then and haven't even seen what the score was.
Who was the awful referee England penalized at every opportunity, even when it was not a penalty, ie Tom Mitchell was never held, yet as game progressed Australia allowed to replicate offences, repeat but no yellow cards disgraceful!!
10.37 Result in the hockey: Scotland 0-9 Australia.
Meanwhile if cricket is your thing, why not join, er, me for the liveblog of that? Yes folks, I'm doing both, although this one is essentially going to get abandoned for an hour or so.
10.34 Gary Lineker is droll.
<noframe>Twitter: Gary Lineker - Day 4 of the Commonwealth games and still Germany haven't won a single medal.</noframe>
10.14 Without ceremony, let's take a quick look at what's happened in the wee hours of this morning.
- Both the men's and women's marathons are underway - the former has been since 9am, the latter since 9.30am. Aly Dixon of England leads the women's race. - It's Scotland 8-11 England in the men's pairs lawn bowls - Scotland are also behind in the hockey: 6-0 to Australia. Everyone will probably be 6-0 down to Australia at some point.
