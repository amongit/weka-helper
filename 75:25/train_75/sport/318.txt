History repeated itself in Glasgow as England were beaten by Singapore in the men’s team table tennis final – just as they had been in Delhi four years ago.
Time proved no healer for Andrew Baggaley, Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford, all members of the team in Delhi, as they were made to pay for a poor start at Scotstoun and settle for silver.
Drinkhall twice led Jian Zhan 1-0 and 2-1 but ended up losing 3-2, before Pitchford was brushed aside 3-0 by Ning Gao.
Baggaley and Drinkhall raced to victory in their doubles match to make it 2-1 overall but, when Zhan dispatched Baggaley 3-0 in 24 minutes, the game was up.
“We’re disappointed but it was always going to be a hard against a very tough team,” Pitchford said. “It’s the same medal as four years ago but we’ve improved so much as a team. We thought we had a chance but it just wasn’t to be.”
