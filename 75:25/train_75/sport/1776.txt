Tailgate Food Porn: The Best Of Instagram (PHOTOS)
There are so many things to love about tailgates: Beer, friendly team rivalries, and (most importantly) food. Just because you don't have access to your kitchen doesn't mean your tailgate can't serve up delicious grub -- in fact, homemade tailgate foods can be some of the best.
Just to prove our point, we've collected some of the best tailgate food porn from Instagram. These people know that being away from the dining room table doesn't mean you have to sacrifice flavor or freshness -- even if it is, fortunately, slightly more acceptable to eat with your hands.
