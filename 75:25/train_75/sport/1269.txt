Heart attack kills witness who was due to appear at doping trial of Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes

Francisco Aguanell had been due in court in Madrid on Wednesday afternoon to back up another witness, Jesús Manzano, the former cyclist and whistleblower whose evidence has helped bring Fuentes to trial.
Fuentes, who is alleged to have worked with Spanish footballers and tennis players as well as cyclists, is accused of endangering public health by leading a doping ring which issued patients with banned substances and conducted blood transfusions.
Manzano, whose revelations in 2004 led to the investigation by Spanish police which became known as Operation Puerto, is expected to provide compelling testimony when he appears on Wednesday.
Aguanell publicly supported Manzano’s claims that his treatment by Fuentes had put his health at risk. Aguanell had also spoken out about Fuentes as long ago as 2004.
There were further complications on Tuesday at the high profile trial when another witness, the Katusha cyclist Ángel Vicioso, failed to appear as scheduled, instead sending a medical certificate exempting him from taking the stand.

Trial judge Julia Santamaria reminded cyclists that if they failed to tell the truth perjury was a criminal offence.
Cyclist Joseba Beloki, who retired in 2007 after being stood down from the 2006 Tour de France for possible connection with Fuentes, told the court he was “100 per cent sure” none of the blood bags found during a raid on Fuentes in 2006 belonged to him.
Another cyclist, David Etxebarria, also denied knowledge of any doping or transfusion practices.
Etxebarria said he did not recognise a document seized by the Civil Guard at the premises of Fuentes which contained his name and a calendar of treatments.
Meanwhile, the Italian anti-doping authority has opened an investigation into former world champion Mario Cipollini as a result of media allegations that he was involved with Fuentes for four years.
The Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport published a year planner that it claimed showed a doping programme drawn up for Cipollini by Fuentes for the 2002 season when he won both Milan-Sanremo and the world road championship. The paper also claimed Cipollini worked with Fuentes from 2001 until 2004. Cipollini’s lawyer has said the claims are absurd.
