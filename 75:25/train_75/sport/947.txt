In the latest Telegraph Cycling Podcast, Richard Moore, Lionel Birnie and Daniel Friebe discuss the route of the 2015 Tour de France, which was announced in Paris last week.
Christian Prudhomme, the Tour director, described it as “an untypical route,” with only 14km of individual time trialling, a late team time trial, the return of cobbles, and the mountains coming late in the race.
Chris Froome reacted by hinting that he might miss the Tour and go for the Giro/Vuelta double. “There’s no two ways about it, next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains,” Froome said. “There’s very little emphasis on time trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains.”
The podcast asks whether this is a genuine threat or a bit of brinkmanship, since it seems clear that the 2013 winner is not a fan of a course that favours pure climbers like Nairo Quintana and the French riders Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. Also, why did Froome and Team Sky spend the day with British Sailing instead of going to Paris for the presentation – an unfortunate clash or a deliberate snub?
Friebe, the author of Mountain High, talks us through the mountain stages, including the Lacets de Montvernier, which in only 3.8km has 18 hairpins, and l’Alpe d’Huez, the final mountain stage, just 24 hours before Paris.
