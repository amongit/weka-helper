The New York Police Department and the Fire Department of the city get together every year to play a friendly ice hockey game for charity.
But this year's match in Uniondale, Long Island, was overshadowed when the two teams began to fight each other on the rink.
Hockey sticks and gloves can be seen littering the rink as the players lock horns.
Players sitting on the bench also got involved in the fight, which caused a 25-minute delay to the game.
The game was eventually played on with the police winning 8-5.
