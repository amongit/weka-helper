Oribe Peralta Goal: Mexico Scores Fastest Olympics Goal On Record (VIDEO)
LONDON -- FIFA officials say Mexico forward Oribe Peralta's goal 29 seconds into the gold medal game against Brazil is the fastest score since the organization started keeping Olympic records in 1976.
Peralta got the Mexicans on the board on Saturday after a turnover by Rafael deep in Brazil territory. His right-footed kick hit the net just inside the left post for a 1-0 lead.
FIFA said it still didn't know if it was the fastest goal ever in the Olympics because it didn't keep track of all the tournaments.
The fastest goal ever in a senior competition was scored by Turkey's Hakan Sukur 11 seconds into a match in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.
FIFA says the fastest goal ever was scored by Brazil's Fabinho, nine seconds into a match at the 2007 Under-17 World Cup in South Korea.
