NBA Fan Looking At Phone Gets Slammed In The Face With Basketball, And It Looks Horrible In Slow Motion
Having good seats to a sporting event can be hazardous to your face, especially if you're not paying attention.
A woman looking at a cell phone got smacked by a tipped pass at a Charlotte Hornets game Wednesday, knocking her glasses off.
According to Associated Press, the woman suffered a bloody nose and was given tissues by the events staff. She was seen laughing and stuck around for the home team's 113-106 defeat to the Sacramento Kings.
Last weekend a Chicago Blackhawks spectator got smacked by dislodged plexiglass, requiring a bandage around her head. She also stuck around to watch the game.
Tough fans.
