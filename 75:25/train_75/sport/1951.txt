Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Miami Heat LIVE: NBA Finals Game 4 At American Airlines Arena
NBA Finals Game 3 Miami Heat
vs.
Oklahoma City Thunder American Airlines Arena Miami, Fla. 8 p.m. ET
The Miami Heat know very well how little a 2-1 series lead in the NBA Finals guarantees. Even if the team to hold such an advantage historically fares quite well, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the rest of the Heat remember holding such an edge last year against the Dallas Mavericks. We all know how that turned out.
With Game 4 in South Beach and James putting up numbers that only a trio of Hall of Fame centers have put up in the playoffs, the Heat are looking to take one step closer to the title.
Having already trailed the No. 1 seed San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, 2-0, Kevin Durant and the Thunder are no strangers to playing with their backs to the wall. After dropping the first two games to the Spurs, the Thunder reeled off four straight wins to clinch a Finals berth.
Will Oklahoma City manage to take home court advantage back with a crucial road win tonight? Or will LeBron dominate once again to help Miami put OKC on the brink of elimination?
