Best Athlete Tweets Of The Week: Metta World Peace, Spencer Hawes Make Noise On Twitter (June 24-29)
Between Mario Balotelli's impressive performance in the Euro 2012 Semifinals, the 2012 NBA Draft and Sidney Crosby's massive 12-year contract, there was no lack of sports trending terms on Twitter this week. As per usual, professional athletes were among those participating in the conversations. Of course, some of the athletes we follow chose to weigh in on off-the-field events like the Supreme Court healthcare ruling.
We've once again scoured our timeline from the past week to bring you what we believe to be the best of the best -- and/or the most bizarre -- that athletes have to offer via Twitter. Vote on which athlete you believe had this week's best tweet. The winner will be given remarkable Interweb cred and 140 characters worth of salutations via the @HuffPostSports Twitter account.
