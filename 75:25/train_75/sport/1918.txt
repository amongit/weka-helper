2012 NBA Summer League: NetScouts Basketball All-Star Team
It was a fun time this past 10 days at the 2012 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. Many rookies and second-year players excelled at the event and some raised questions about their NBA ability. We'll be writing some recap articles on the event on this site and other websites we contribute to. First here is the 2012 NBA Summer League NetScouts Basketball All-Star Team.
1st Team
(Co-MVP) Josh Selby (Memphis) (5 games: 24.2 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.2 apg, 2.4 spg). Selby was incredible throughout the event scoring 30 points or more twice and shot 56 percent from the field including 64 percent from deep (27-of-42). He almost won the last game for the Grizzlies in limited minutes hitting three late three-pointers with one after a steal of the in-bounds pass. Selby will push for increased playing time this year at both guard positions.
(Co-MVP) Damian Lillard (Portland) (4 games: 26.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 5.3 apg). Lillard showed why Portland had the confidence to draft him at #6. He'll be a starter and 20 ppg scorer from day one. Lillard can play point as well as move over to the two at times. He has a scorer's mentality, can get by his defender at will and has NBA range. He was the leading scorer of the Summer League.
Tobias Harris (Memphis) (5 games: 20.8 ppg, 7.0 rpg). Harris, a versatile 6'8, was consistent in his five games as he scored between 18 and 24 points in each game and had two 12 rebound games. Harris is athletic, strong and can score in a variety of ways.
Markieff Morris (Phoenix) (5 games: 19.8 ppg, 9.8 rpg, 2.0 bpg). Morris should come into his own in his second year with the Suns. He grabbed 17 rebounds in one game and closed out this event with a 24-point, 11-rebound effort in a win over Memphis.
Terrence Jones (Houston) (5 games: 18.2 ppg, 8.6 rpg). Jones was a great value pick for the Rockets at #18. At 6'9, 252 pounds he has the prototypical power forward body and combines that with ball skills and the ability to score inside and out. He's part of an excellent influx of talent for Houston along with Jeremy Lamb, Donatas Motiejunas, Royce White and Scott Machado.
2nd Team
Jimmy Butler (Chicago) (4 games: 20.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg)
Malcolm Thomas (Chicago) (5 games: 11.4 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.4 bpg)
Cory Joseph (San Antonio) (5 games: 17.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 5.2 apg, 1.8 spg)
Jeremy Lamb (Houston) (5 games: 20.0 ppg, 4.4 rpg)
Jordan Hamilton (Denver): 5 games: 19.2 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 3.6 apg

Adam Morrison (L.A. Clippers: 20.0 ppg), Wes Johnson (Minnesota: 20.5 ppg), Josh Akognon (Sacramento: 19.3 ppg), John Henson (Milwaukee: 18.3 ppg, 6.8 rpg), Thomas Robinson (Sacramento: 13.0 ppg, 9.8 rpg), Donatas Motiejunas (Houston: 16.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg), Bradley Beal (Washington: 17.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg), Jae Crowder (Dallas: 16.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg), Dominique Jones (16.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg), Ed Davis (Toronto: 16.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg).
