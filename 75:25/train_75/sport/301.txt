Serbia v Scotland: Steven Naismith says Gordon Strachan's side are improving despite defeat by Wales

Ponderous and wasteful in possession, blunt up front, porous at the back and lacking wit and invention in midfield, it was not an auspicious start to Gordon Strachan’s competitive career as Scotland manager.
Yet Everton midfielder Steven Naismith managed not only to discern positive signs amid the humiliation at Hampden Park, but also claimed that the national team are getting better. They have the opportunity to provide evidence of this improvement in Serbia on Tuesday.
“I still believe progress is being made when I look at the quality in the squad,” Naismith said. “As a forward player myself, even just looking at the players in my position tells me that. I’m not getting a game now, whereas a year or two ago I was playing in most of them. The squad has definitely got stronger.
“A lot of the boys are still quite young, so maybe it is an immaturity thing. But it is something we need to get over. We can’t continue saying we are progressing and then not produce it on the pitch.”
"Friday night was frustrating for everyone. It was there for all to see that we made a nervy start. If you look through the team, you would say it was a bit more inexperienced than usual.

"Two of our main central midfielders [Scott Brown, Darren Fletcher] were missing. That maybe caused the unsure start. After we got over that, I thought we played some good stuff. Kenny Miller came on and was causing a lot of problems for Wales up front.
"I thought Robert Snodgrass was our most influential player, while Chris Burke was creating a few chances as well but the moment which changed the match was obviously the red card. “Up until then, I thought we definitely held our own after the initial 15 or 20 minutes of dominance from Wales.”
Naismith is 26 and has yet to reach his peak years as a footballer but already he is beginning to wonder if he will ever be given the chance to represent his country in the finals of a major tournament. The sad fact is that every one of the squad which made it to France in 1998 has retired and a generation of players have subsequently come and gone without experiencing the thrill of competing on the greatest stages of all.
"Kenny Miller touched on it a bit over the weekend and he has been in the national team for many years,” said Naismith. “It definitely makes guys like myself, who are coming to the middle of their careers, think about it. There is a great opportunity to go and play in the best tournaments in the world and you don't want to give that up without a fight. You remember the days when we were qualifying on a regular basis.”
The worry now for the Tartan Army is that Strachan will be unable to lift Scotland from the foot of Group A. Such a failure would have serious consequences for future tournaments. "Dropping down another pot in the draws is not what we want at all but if you are in there you just need to roll your sleeves up and get back out of it,” said Naismith.
"This squad have not won enough games to keep us in the higher pots. But look at Wales, they are in the bottom pot and they are an up and coming team. If you drop down there, it does make your job a bit harder because you are one of the lower seeds. But we still have to fancy ourselves against a lot of teams at home.”
Victory in Novi Sad would see the Scots leapfrog their hosts (and, probably, Macedonia) and Naismith believes that is an achievable ambition. "We should have beaten them at Hampden,” he said.
“We had some good chances and played well. I was a culprit myself with the chances we missed. It will be a different game over there. There will be a hostile crowd and they are coming off a defeat to Croatia. There are a few places up for grabs now, with Steven Fletcher being injured and Snodgrass being suspended so the boys who come in will want to make an impression.”
