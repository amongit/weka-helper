Tim Duncan Miss: Spurs Star Missed Short Hook Shot In Game 7 Loss To Heat (VIDEO)
According to Tim Duncan, it was a bunny. By any name, the short right-handed hook shot is the type that the four-time NBA champion has made throughout his career. In the final minute of Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals, he missed it.
"Game 7, missing a layâ€‘up to tie the game," Duncan told reporters after the game when asked what will stick with him longest about the series. "Making a bad decision down the stretch. Just unable to stop Dwyane and LeBron. Probably for me Game 7 is always going to haunt me."
With the Spurs trailing 90-88, the 16-year veteran received a pass on the block. With Shane Battier defending him and no other player in the paint, Duncan spun into the lane and took a short, running hook shot. The ball hit the back of the rim and bounced out of the cylinder. Duncan then had another chance to tie the game with a tip-in, but the ball did not find its way through the hoop.
Miami grabbed the rebound with 42 seconds left.
As LeBron James dribbled up the court, Duncan ran back on defense and then slapped the hardwood. San Antonio failed to score another point for the rest of the game and Miami went on to win its second straight NBA title.
The 37-year-old was asked after the game why he smacked the floor in that moment.
"That's out of me just missing the bunny," he said referring to the missed hook shot. "I got by Shane and had a layup to tie the game. It's just frustration."
