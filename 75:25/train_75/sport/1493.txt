Simon Dyson delighted with Irish Open success
Simon Dyson states that renewed inner confidence was the key to his "fantastic" win at the Irish Open.
The Englishman recorded his fifth European Tour title with a one-stroke win ahead of Richard Green at Killarney.
Dyson, part of the successful Chubby Chandler stable, says that the victory has given him the belief that he can hold his own with the "top guys" in the sport and enjoy more success in the future.
