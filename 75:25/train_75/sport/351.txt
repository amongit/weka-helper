Squash, wrestling and baseball-softball battle to be chosen by IOC as an Olympic event for 2020 Games

In 2009, the International Olympic Committee decided to promote golf to the list of 25 “core sports”.
It was so impressed by the star wattage of Tiger Woods, who contributed to the presentation, that it invited some of the world’s richest and most inaccessible sportspeople to join its festival of Corinthian values.
The irony is that, if the meeting had happened just a fortnight later, Woods’s credibility would have been badly dented by his encounter with a fire hydrant.
Four years on, it is time for another IOC knees-up in Buenos Aires. And squash, one of the sports that lost out to golf last time around, is back on the catwalk for another agonising beauty parade.
On a shortlist of three, it has one strong rival in wrestling – which is aiming to show “bouncebackability” after being dropped from the Games in February – and one weak one in a hybrid form of baseball-softball. How can you take a sport seriously when it cannot decide what to call itself?

Wrestling’s proponents point out that 29 countries appeared on the medal table at the London Olympics, making it one of the most international and egalitarian sports at the Games.
In India, for instance, young men of all castes flock to the local akhara (basically a square of churned-up mud). Increasingly, thanks to the mould-breaking contribution of athletes such as Geeta Phogat, young women do too.
Squash, meanwhile, is hobbled by its perception as a sport for toffs. How many movies have you seen – from 1983’s Trading Places to this year’s Broken City – where politicians and tycoons intersperse their sleazy dealings with a sweaty lumber around a squash court? And why don’t they ever hit the ball down the wall, like you are supposed to?
It is true that in the 1980s there was a squash boom among the executive classes.
During Margaret Thatcher’s heyday it was as reliable a signifier as black ash furniture and the Porsche 911 Carrera. But that was 30 years ago.
Today it can claim to have produced world champions from all five continents. The top-ranked male and female of the moment are Ramy Ashour, of Egypt, and Malaysia’s Nicol David, two players who are viewed with as much reverence by their peers as Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams are in tennis.
Andy Murray – who played squash as a child – backed its case last week, explaining that “you have to be extremely fit, have very good hand-eye co-ordination, good feel, and good touch”.
He did also allude to the old chestnut that “it’s maybe not the best spectator sport”. But James Willstrop, the Yorkshireman who stands at No 3 in the world, contests this.
“People are always saying that squash looks too slow and easy on TV,” Willstrop told Telegraph Sport, “but I reckon that’s the case with all sports. When you watch cricket, you have no idea how fast Stuart Broad is bowling unless you are at the ground.”
Just as Woods ambushed squash four years ago, the shemozzle over wrestling’s hokey-cokey looks likely to stymie it this time.
“There is a lot of sentiment that this process has been a disservice to sports that have worked hard to gain acceptance and then have to compete with an existing sport,” one insider told the Wall Street Journal this week.
Should such predictions be born out by this weekend’s vote, squash will feel a justifiable sense of injustice.
Because, while an Olympic gold medal would be a nice little bauble for Woods or Rory McIlroy, it would change Willstrop’s life on the spot.
