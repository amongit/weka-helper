Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal handed boost ahead of Premier League game with Arsenal at Emirates

Louis van Gaal could be boosted by the return of as many as four first-team players for Manchester United’s trip to Arsenal on Saturday with the Old Trafford injury crisis beginning to ease.
Although the loss of Dutch midfielder Daley Blind to a knee ligament injury for an estimated 4-6 weeks will force Van Gaal to re-shuffle his midfield, the United manager is confident of being able to add Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Radamel Falcao to the suspension-free Chris Smalling to his squad for the game at the Emirates.
Michael Carrick, who played in United’s most recent outing against Crystal Palace before withdrawing from the England squad with a groin strain, is also expected to be fit to travel to London this weekend.
United remain hopeful that the finger injury sustained by David de Gea during training with Spain last week does not prove serious enough to rule him out of the Arsenal game, but the goalkeeper will not be fully assessed by the club’s medical staff until he returns to Manchester on Wednesday.
Argentine defender Marcos Rojo, who suffered a dislocated shoulder during the defeat to Manchester City earlier this month, is the only long-term absentee among those players recently sidelined.

Full-back Rafael da Silva is close to a return after almost a month on the sidelines with what has been described as a ‘muscular’ injury, while Ashley Young is also expected back shortly following a groin injury.
However, with Evans, Jones and Falcao all remaining at the Aon Training Centre during the international break in order to focus on their rehabilitation, all three are in contention to be named in the squad against Arsenal.
