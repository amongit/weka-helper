Current manager Steve Clarke admits such an achievement is unlikely to be repeated. He is wary of false projections having been a part of the unfashionable Chelsea squad in 1992-93 who initially went top and stood second after 19 games before a free-fall, going 12 matches without a win, a run that replaced hopes of a title challenge with relegation fears.
“The top division in England can come back to haunt you,” Clarke said after James Morrison and an own goal by Gary Caldwell secured a first away victory of the season at Wigan, whose sole reply arrived from Arouna Kone. Had Everton not beaten Sunderland with two late strikes, this result would have sent Clarke’s side outright fourth.
Previously, there had been a disparity between West Brom’s home and away form: five wins and just the one defeat at the Hawthorns and just two points registered elsewhere. Clarke believes results have not been consistent with performances. “This is the first time we’ve really got our reward,” he added.
The visitors certainly merited their victory. The strength of Clarke’s squad was marked by the fact that he can afford to rotate, leaving out Peter Odemwingie, who had scored twice in the previous win over Southampton, in favour of Romelu Lukaku.
West Brom are evolving under Clarke. There remains the physicality that was there under Roy Hodgson but improvements in key areas. Claudio Yacob, the Argentine midfielder, has adapted to the English football instantly; Billy Jones has developed into the most underrated attacking right back in the league; while levels of commitment are clear – Shane Long played again despite a succession of minor injuries and the work-rate of the Irishman, particularly, meant Wigan could not build a momentum in their passing game from the back.

Previously, Wigan’s recent form was the kind usually reserved for spring when the grim spectre of relegation reliably looms. Here, the approach remained the same although the execution was lacking.
“We have found a good level in terms of our performance but sometimes lack a know-how and arrogance to get a result when we’re not playing to well,” said Wigan manager Roberto Martinez, who believes the natural order of the Premier League will soon start to take shape.
“You’ve got six or seven clubs with incredible budgets and financially, no one can get close to them. But I do feel from eighth to 20th is wide open and down to very small margins. The positions now don’t tell you too much.”
