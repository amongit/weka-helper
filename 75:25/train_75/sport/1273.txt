Wrestling, modern pentathlon and taekwondo under threat from losing Olympic status as IOC consider future

The IOC, which will on Tuesday morning begin a two-day executive board meeting, plans to remove one of the 26 current sports from the summer Olympics to make way for a new replacement to be nominated later in the year.
There has been widespread speculation that modern pentathlon, with its old-fashioned mix of vastly varying disciplines, is most at risk but that sport is understood to retain some influential support within the IOC.
That means wrestling may emerge as an alternative to be culled, with taekwondo also under consideration.
The executive board will review a report from the IOC programme commission assessing each of the sports contested at last summerâ€™s London Olympics.
Cycling is not at risk despite the series of doping scandals which have engulfed the sport.

The report analyses more than three dozen criteria, including television ratings, ticket sales, anti-doping policy and global participation and popularity.
With no official rankings or recommendations contained in the report, the final decision by the 15-member executive board can be heavily influenced by political, emotional and sentimental factors.
The last sports removed from the Olympics were baseball and softball, off the programme since the 2008 Beijing Games.
Joining the programme at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro will be golf and rugby.
Baseball and softball have combined forces to seek inclusion in 2020, competing against karate, squash, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding and wushu.
Whichever sport is dropped on Tuesday will join those seven vying for the single opening in 2020.
