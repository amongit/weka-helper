I have often wondered why Formula One seems to have such an atmosphere of negativity around it. Be it changes over the rules, the quieter engine noise, how the money is shared: there always seems to be the foundation for debate about the sport.
Formula One isn’t unique in this regard. When I read the sports pages or watch the news, there is constant criticism of football managers. On the world stage, there’s always something negative about Fifa and its president, Sepp Blatter.

But F1 seems to attract a disproportionate amount of doom and gloom. To my mind, much of this naysaying is unfair. You don’t have to simply take my word for it – the figures don’t lie. In terms of global audience and global reach, Formula One ticks all the boxes and it does so by some margin over other global sports.
Of course there are problems – I will try and outline some of them and suggestions for improvements - but ahead of the new season, without just resorting to marketing spin, you can shut down a lot of the criticisms fairly quickly.
THE FINANCES
This is probably the biggest gripe people have about modern Formula One. But if you sign up to the terms of a contract, as the small teams did, then I’m sorry, you cannot have buyers’ remorse.
I admire all the teams, because they have an incredible set of skills (which I don’t have) to keep the show on the road. But the bottom line is they’ve chosen to do it. You can’t cash in a promise for costs caps and so on.

The fans at home have got a lot more to worry about than hearing some team boss whinge about Ferrari getting more money just because they’ve been part of the championship for longer. (For the record, that seems like quite a sensible idea).
Whether it is totally fair or not is a complex issue, but it’s been consistent and transparent to the teams when they have entered. Of course, engine costs going up from five million to 20 million doesn’t help the small teams. But if you don’t like the business, leave the business.
THE RACING
When I raced in Formula One, particularly in the mid-2000s, there was such a big problem with ‘dirty air’, and trying to follow another car, it made overtaking almost impossible sometimes. People forget now, but the races could be monotonous. It’s better now. It’s never going to be every single lap, of every single race.

F1 is more like playing a game of chess than something like basketball, where you get scores of 100 almost every game. Understanding the subtleties and the tactics are part of its appeal. The very nature of qualifying puts the fastest car at the front. People seem aghast about this as if it exists solely in F1. In tennis, the seeded players don’t have to qualify and have easier matches in the early rounds.
In any sport there are periods of dominance. Floyd Mayweather is undefeated, but that doesn’t make his fights any less exciting. Mercedes are on top now, and are likely to be in 2015, but it won’t last forever.
THE PERSONALITIES
This is perhaps somewhere F1 could do better. I made a few colourful remarks towards the end of my career in interviews. I joked about kicking “three colours of ****” out of Felipe Massa after we collided in Australia. Louise Goodman, then working for ITV, had to hear me make reference to her womanhood after a question about pit lane speed limits. There is less of that now.
It’s the nature of modern communication. The drivers are also so young they haven’t had time to sleep on a few sofas or do a few paper rounds. They’re growing up in a different way to someone colourful like James Hunt.

The biggest problem in the end is the teams put their trust in the driver in the car, but other than stopping them saying something outrageous, they don’t meddle. We should be trying to encourage these guys.
Look at Daniel Ricciardo. He’s come along, and smiles all the time because he loves being an F1 driver, and what happens? People watching think they’d love to be a grand prix driver. It’s simple but just takes a little bit of work.
THE CARS
The ‘easier to drive’ argument is fair comment in terms of all the aids the driver has now. But the driver still has to make all the decisions. The skill of driving is not any less today than it ever has been, even if physically it is less demanding than 10 years ago (I remember crashing in Budapest as a rookie in the days when we didn’t have power steering because it was so exhausting).

We’re so used to things getting more that trying to understand that lap times aren’t getting quicker isn’t always an easy sell. But there are good reasons for this, be it trying to improve fuel efficiency to appease the green movement or making accidents more survivable. It still is, by some margin, the fastest form of closed-circuit racing.
I am not a huge fan of the noise, and the liveries are still not as dramatic as they could be, but the move to introduce sparks and other cheap ways to make the sport more spectacular are welcome. Fireworks are no less exciting now than they were hundreds of years ago.
THE RULES
The pessimism about the rules in F1 has been so great that people have even taken to mocking restrictions of helmet designs, which to me seems a fundamentally good idea. Fans care about the drivers, so why make it more difficult to identify them by changing their helmets all the time? When I drove for McLaren, Ron Dennis offered me and my team-mate Mika Hakkinen a decent chunk of money to take over design of the helmets, but we both said no. It’s part of your identity and your brand. It has history and meaning.

The way F1 changes the rules can often seem kneejerk, but that’s the race of a technology-driven sport. It keeps us on our toes. This week they’re banning tyre changes, or whatever it may be. I raced with all sorts of different engines, active suspension, slick tyres, groove tyres, but it’s still always been Formula One.
