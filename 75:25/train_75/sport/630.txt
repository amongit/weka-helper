England’s squad announcement for the West Indies tour should have been the occasion to move on from the World Cup debacle but their Test captain, Alastair Cook, blew that apart by criticising his sacking as one-day captain and blaming the first-round exit on the decision.
Cook had maintained his silence since his axeing on Dec 19 after spending 3½ years plotting the team’s World Cup campaign. Earlier this month Peter Moores, the England coach, was adamant that Cook had “moved on” and was planning England’s busy year ahead, which includes 17 Test matches.

But the sacking clearly still rankles with Cook and his comments, which he made in Abu Dhabi where he is preparing to make his playing return for the MCC, put further pressure on the decision, which was made by Paul Downton, the England managing director, and Moores.
They were right to remove Cook, but they dithered for far too long over the decision and what possibly hurts Cook the most is that they backed him publicly just a few days before sacking him.
Cook is the England and Wales Cricket Board’s model cricketer, a man who rarely utters anything remotely controversial so by his standards he gave a damning assessment of Moores, Eoin Morgan and the management when he said the team needed leadership after looking “shell-shocked” by their opening defeats in the World Cup at the hands of Australia and New Zealand.

“I was there for 3½ years trying to do a job. We got to No 1 in the world with a full-strength side and got to the final of the Champions Trophy,” he said. “There were things I can be very proud of. As any captain will tell you, leading your country in a World Cup is a huge honour and one that can never be taken lightly. I was very much looking forward to that.

“I understand the pressure I was under. I wasn’t scoring the runs I should or could have been scoring, so I understand that my position was in jeopardy. I said at the end of Sri Lanka that if there was a change, I couldn’t complain because I hadn’t scored the runs.
“But I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament. I don’t know what’s gone on on that tour, and I can only speak from watching a little bit from afar, but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games.
Even England's experienced players had no answer
“That’s when you need real leadership to help steer you through. Whether I would have made a difference, I don’t know. I can’t speak about what’s gone on there in depth, but you always back yourself, and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken away from me.
“The selectors made that decision because they thought it was the best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong, but now it’s very easy to say that.”

Cook will lead a patched-up squad lacking the injured Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, who have become important players. There are recalls for Jonathan Trott and Ben Stokes and call-ups for the uncapped trio of Mark Wood, the Durham pace bowler, and Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth and Adil Rashid.
As the squad for the West Indies squad includes seven players who featured in the World Cup, the potential for low morale to impact on the Test arena is a worry for Cook, who fears the confidence built by last summer’s win over India has been shattered.

“I wouldn’t say all of it has been, but a hell of a lot of it has been. You have to remember that it is a different format and you get a change, but all teams are grouped under the same English cricket umbrella, and we can’t be naive enough to think that it’s not,” he said.
“We have a repairing job to do, and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and starting winning. There was a good feel-good factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Test matches. Since then, it’s been tough going. We’ve got to rebuild again.”
Trott’s comeback is a gamble, for nobody really knows how he will react when he faces high-class fast bowling again. The West Indies do not provide that challenge these days but Australia are lurking with their fast-bowling stocks high and England go to South Africa at the end of the year, where Trott struggled on a previous trip, although he did well when he led the Lions there earlier this year.

“We feel he is very relaxed and he is happy to go again,” James Whitaker, the national selector, said. Trott’s place at No 3 has been filled by Gary Ballance and the middle order is settled so his only realistic chance of a return in the West Indies is to open with Cook. Lyth offers an alternative as a specialist opener and the two two-day warm-up matches in St Kitts will be crucial for both players.
Wood won selection ahead of Steven Finn after impressing on the Lions tour to South Africa. He hails from Ashington, the hometown of Steve Harmison, but is more in the style of James Anderson with an ability to reverse swing the older ball.
Adil Rashid, the 27-year-old leg-spinning all-rounder, has been rewarded for his progress at Yorkshire with his first England selection for five years but the choice of one-day specialist James Tredwell is baffling. He has taken just 40 first-class wickets at 47 over the past two years and was loaned out by Kent last season.

Cook also shut the door on a return for Kevin Pietersen, saying he believes it is “highly unlikely” he can play for England again after writing his highly critical autobiography last year.
Cook, as Test skipper, would have to agree to a return for Pietersen who is currently in the process of trying to wriggle out of a an IPL deal to play county cricket in a bid to win his England place back.
“I think it’s very unlikely,” he said about a Pietersen return. “There’s been a hell of a lot of stuff happened with his book and all that kind of stuff. It’s a long way back from that.”
