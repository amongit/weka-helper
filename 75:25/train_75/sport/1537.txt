Klitschkos doubt David Haye's desire for rematch
Wladimir Klitschko is open to the possibility of a rematch with David Haye but questions whether the London boxer has the stomach for another clash after their one-sided bout in June.
Instead, the Ukrainian tells BBC Sport has his eye on taking on the winner of this month's British title fight between Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury.
Brother Vitali says he looks forward to knocking out Haye if they ever meet, while both Klitschkos say they plan to dominate the heavyweight division for years to come.
