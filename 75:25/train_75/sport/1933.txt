Terrence Ross To Raptors With No. 8 Pick In 2012 NBA Draft
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) â€” The Toronto Raptors selected guard Terrence Ross out of the University of Washington with the No. 8 selection in the NBA draft Thursday.

Ross played shooting guard and small forward with the Huskies. A native of Portland, Ore., he is listed at six-foot-seven, 197 pounds.

The 21-year-old spent two seasons with Washington and averaged 16.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists in his sophomore year.

He shot 45 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range in his second year, and was named First Team, All-Pac-12.

Toronto missed the playoffs after finishing the lockout-shortened season fourth in the five-team Atlantic Division with a 23-43 record under first-year coach Dwane Casey.
