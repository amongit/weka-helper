Scotland admit defeat in attempt to reach World Cup in Brazil after Wales loss and turn focus to Euro 2016

When it was announced that 24 teams would contest the European Championship finals in France, the news was greeted with relief in Scotland, following the failure to reach any major tournament finals since the World Cup – also in France – in 1998.
However, unlike Fifa, who uses its own rankings table to determine seeding places, Uefa’s comes from the three most recent qualifying campaigns. Scotland have won only seven games from a possible 21 in their attempts to reach the World Cup finals in 2010, Euro 2012 and the current qualifiers – and have recorded only three victories from their last 13 competitive matches.
With five games remaining in their Group A schedule, the Scots badly need to pick up victories, but Gordon Strachan will have to cope with weakened resources which could make the task of beating Serbia close to impossible, according to Craig Brown, the last manager to succeed in getting Scotland through a qualifying campaign.
“Our target has to be to secure a better seeding position,” said Brown. “Like all managers who are newly in charge of a team in a dead campaign, Gordon will want to try out new players and bring on some of the younger ones, but he has to do that without compromising the seeding position because if that goes down it makes his job tougher and embarrasses the nation.
“He was in a tough position going into the game against Wales because he had to start without three first choice players – Scott Brown, Darren Fletcher and James Morrison. After only two minutes Steven Fletcher was added to that list because of injury, then Robert Snodgrass got himself sent off and is now ruled out of the trip to Serbia.

“To put it bluntly, Gordon has now lost half of his preferred outfield team – and, frankly, it’s close to impossible for Scotland to succeed when reduced by that number of players.”
Brown also noted a deficiency which he believes Strachan will have to remedy as a matter of urgency. “Wales had the kick off and played 13 consecutive passes – most of them in their own half, certainly – before Scotland got a touch,” he said.
“When the second half started the ball was played back to Gary Caldwell and he put it straight out of play. When life is hard, you don’t want to make it any tougher than it needs to be.”
The impact of losing to Wales for the second time in the campaign – Chris Coleman’s side won 2-1 in Cardiff in October – was deeply dispiriting, by the Scots’ own admission. “The more results go against us, the more confidence will be dented,” said Shaun Maloney. “We lost 2-1 at home in a must-win game so it was a pretty low dressing room and it’s going to be pretty difficult to pick everyone up for Tuesday. The next couple of days it will be difficult to get any sort of positives.
“After a couple of days we might find the odd one. Grant Hanley played particularly well for us in one of his first matches but beyond that it’s going to be pretty difficult.”
”It’s obviously been a terrible start. It’s a bit of a cliché but we just have to think about the Serbia game now. We obviously have to improve and just try to get a decent performance.
“There has been a lot of disappointment with the start to the qualifying campaign and it will be hard to get out of that. Obviously you do feel the pride of the nation and we want to finish as high as we can, but we just literally need to take it to the next game and we need to improve.”
Meanwhile, Kenny Miller – who won his 67th Scotland cap when he replaced Steven Fletcher on Friday – is all but reconciled never to play for his country in a major tournament finals. “You get to 33 and that’s probably another campaign away,” he said. “It’s looking highly unlikely that I’ll get to a finals and that’s hugely disappointing.
“Is this the end? That’s something the manager will have a look at and I will as well. There’s nothing in my career that has meant more to me than playing for my country and I am honoured to have played 67 times.”
