Laura Robson forced to postpone return

Laura Robson will miss the Australian Open and will instead return to action with a series of low-key tournaments in February.
Robson, 20, sustained a left wrist injury more than a year ago and has not played a match since the first round in Melbourne in January last year, when she was clearly far from fully fit in a heavy defeat against Kirsten Flipkens.
The Briton subsequently opted to have surgery and had hoped to be back in time for the year’s first grand slam, which begins on Jan 19.
That looked unlikely when the entry list was released last month without the former British No 1’s name on it. She could have arranged a wild card into either the main draw or qualifying but will instead ease herself back on to the tour.
Robson’s return is due to come on the second-tier ITF circuit next month while her first WTA Tour event could be in Bogota in early April.

The Australian-born Londoner faces a long road to get back to anywhere near the career-high ranking of 27 she reached in July 2013, but her main priority for the season will simply be staying healthy.
Marin Cilic, the US Open champion, said that he could miss the Australian Open because of an arm injury. “An MRI exam in Zagreb showed that after some 20 days of therapy the situation with the [right upper arm] injury has improved,” Cilic said.
“Since there is very little time for a full recovery and training, my appearance at the Australian Open is unfortunately under a big question mark. I have not cancelled my appearance in Melbourne. I will leave it for another seven to eight days to see how the situation will develop.”
Novak Djokovic, the Australian Open champion, will start the ATP World tour season by playing doubles to determine whether he is fit enough to begin the new year with a bid for a 49th career title.
Doubts were cast over Djokovic’s ability to make a prompt start to what could be a history-making year by the fever which caused his withdrawal from the final of the Abu Dhabi exhibition on Saturday, which was as a result won by Andy Murray.
Djokovic was nevertheless well enough to travel to Doha and he expects to make an exploratory start today, in partnership with the young compatriot Filip Krajinovic.
If that goes well, Djokovic would begin an attempt to succeed the title‑holder Rafael Nadal with a debut match in the Qatar Open against another fellow Serb, Dusan Lajovic, on Tuesday.
