It just took me by surprise, seeing all those people there and cheering. When we had finished, everyone wanted to interview me, and not the winner, because I’m the only one from Afghanistan.
I wasn’t pleased with my time – I had trained so much, worked so hard. But it was still a good experience, and definitely the most important of my life. It was so good to be able to learn from all the other girls. I talked with a lot of the other runners, and they were all encouraging me. There was a girl from Yemen who was also Muslim and she was wishing me good luck; I also met with Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the world champion from Jamaica at my training, which was a great experience.
Getting medals from the Olympic Games is very difficult for every athlete and for my country and me, it is even harder. The training facilities are much worse than most other countries so we cannot prepare as well.
But I knew I was not going to win a medal when I came here; I am here to begin a new era for the women of Afghanistan to show people that we can do the same things that people from other countries can do. There is no difference between us.
I’m a university student, studying personal training, and I hope to set up a club for women when I go back. I want to become a teacher in our university because we only have one female teacher in my department. I would like to go on a Fulbright scholarship at another country and come back to Afghanistan and do something for women in sport.

When I go back to Afghanistan, I will get down to my training even harder than before and I want to use the facilities here more before I leave as our track at home is not good. I hope to do better for my country and I am going to continue running until 2016 in Brazil.
