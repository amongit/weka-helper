Manor owner Stephen Fitzpatrick throws in £30 million of his own money to save beleaguered team

They say to make a small fortune in Formula One you need to start with a large fortune. Energy boss Stephen Fitzpatrick, the saviour of the Manor team, has clearly taken heed of that phrase, throwing in £30 million of his own money to save the beleaguered outfit.
After a few emails at the end of last year to his friend, the former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King, and some desperate rebuilding, the team formerly known as Marussia are miraculously preparing to fly to Australia for the season-opening grand prix on March 15. The final hurdle is passing the crash tests for their rapidly-cobbled together cars at the end of this week.
Fitzpatrick, who was named the 'entrepreneur of the year' in 2014, is a self-confessed fan and jumped at the chance to get involved in Formula One, even if it meant footing the bill.
Speaking at the team’s launch at Millbank Tower, overlooking the river Thames, the Northern Irishman said he expected to receive the £28 million of prize money at the end of March which will help keep Manor afloat. The team only came out of administration last Friday after four months on the brink.
Fitzpatrick, a former JP Morgan trader, added that the team will stick to the budget of previous years – just over £60 million – and he had no intention of spending any more. In the profligate world of Formula One, that will not be an easy task, especially if they are to have any hope of clinging on to the back of the grid.
"Until November last year I was on wrong side of F1 fence," Fitzpatrick said.
"My most recent F1 experience was I went to the grand prix in Singapore with a friend, we were walking down the track at the end of the race and looking at all the fans lined up on the pit wall – and looking at garages. I said we need to figure out a way to get over there.
"One of the things that really motivated me was how great a story it could be to figure out a way to help this team cling to survival."
Fitzpatrick, clearly giddy at the experience but equally forceful in his assessment of the task ahead for Manor, has yet to visit their makeshift factory in Dinnington, Yorkshire, but he has committed his money anyway.
The team have one driver in England’s Will Stevens, and are not far from naming a second. It is understood that King’s son, Jordan, who races in GP2, will not fill the breach. King had been offered the chance to go 50-50 with Fitzpatrick, but decided not to put in his own money.
Manor is one of few success stories to come out of Formula One over the winter, with Caterham collapsing and Force India desperately struggling for money. Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One’s ringmaster, has even had to bail out the sport’s three smallest with a £20 million advance to make sure they make it to Melbourne.

But Fitzpatrick, King, and Graeme Lowdon, sporting director, said they were expecting no handouts from Ecclestone. “We knew the rules when we got involved, and we plan to stick to them,” Fitzpatrick said.
The 37-year-old joked: “We are not expecting to win any races – at least not until half way through the season.”
Manor have had to desperately modify their existing car so that it meets the 2015 rules, and plan to introduce a brand new model midway through the season. They will now begin the search for sponsors and the long road to clawing themselves into competitive order.
