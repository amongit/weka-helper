London Marathon 2014: Mo Farah vows to return to the roads after disappointing debut

Trying his manful best to sound upbeat amid his obvious deflation, Mo Farah sounded part-Arnie Schwarzenegger and part-Vera Lynn in the London race headquarters, adamant that “I’ll be back … don’t know where, don’t know when” on the marathon roads.
It was, of course, the champion’s spirit inside Farah that instructed him to vow that he would not leave his battle with his new challenge “on a low”, that somewhere down the line he would have another bump into the London wall.
Yet somebody needed to gently tell him he does not have to meet again with this new foe, that it would be all right to ‘just say no, Mo’ to the merciless marathon.
Where this event is concerned, Britain’s greatest track runner does not need to try to keep playing the terminator. Not for a few years at any rate. Instead, after this chastening beginning against the hardest men of the road, there is no shame in returning to concentrate on terminating the ambitions of his track rivals, as he has been doing ruthlessly for three seasons and, hopefully, will do again at the Rio Olympics two years hence.
Never mind that this was a worthwhile, even courageous, experiment in a non-global championship year and that to become the second fastest Briton in history represents an honourable start; everything about Farah’s demeanour suggested he understood eighth place and not being able to supplant Steve Jones in the domestic record books represented failure for a serial winner.

Radcliffe on how Farah can win
“Without the crowd, I don’t think I would have even finished,” he even admitted. Yes, it was that hard for him, with legs feeling increasingly like bollards. He kept going out of pride and spirit, yet his initial discovery here must have been that the best marathon men inhabit a different world of pain and staying power. He could not match them and there remain doubts he ever can.
Even given the long stretches when he had to plough on alone in no-man’s land between the elite leaders and a chasing group being paced too slow for his liking, Farah again could not adequately demonstrate that he has the qualities of stamina, endurance and efficient road running style to truly thrive from distances of half-marathon upwards on the roads.
Could this have been the day when Farah’s limits were properly revealed? After all, it has always taken a leap of the imagination to believe a man who only nine months ago ran the sixth fastest 1,500m in history could also be able to run a 2hr 4min marathon.
That would represent just about the most astonishing spread of racing achievement in athletics history but this run, his third successive defeat on the roads after his half-marathon losses in the Great North Run and New York, hinted that, as Paula Radcliffe has suggested, Farah’s loping style may not be the most efficient for marathon running.
Ok, there can be no final judgments on one race, especially since there had been enough rumours in the London build up that his preparation, even beyond his collapse after the New York half-marathon, had been hit by a calf injury.
When this was put to him, it was to Farah’s credit that he would not reach for any excuses. “I had a few bits on the way but I was fine,” he said. “Champions get on with it and leave it behind. I’ve learnt that from the Kenyans.”
Champions also thrive on the hardest challenge. Farah could have taken the easier, if admittedly less lucrative, option, like fellow track maestro Kenenisa Bekele, of making his debut in a less competitive race.
Yet though his first outing was far less successful than the Ethiopian’s exciting opening triumph in Paris last weekend, there was something admirable about Farah’s decision to throw himself into the highest-quality marathon in history because “this is my city … I had to do it here”.
Champions also fancy they can silence doubters. Haile Gebrselassie – how extraordinary it was to see him as a smiling pacemaker here – finished only third in his 2002 marathon debut in London in 2-06-35, 1min 46sec quicker than Farah’s bow, but later went on to break the world record.
“I will do another marathon,” asserted Farah. “It could be in six months’ time, next year or in a few years. We’ll make that decision as a team and make the right choice.”
Surely, that right choice should be to look at the marathon again after Rio. Alberto Salazar, Farah’s coach, said last year the real choice was whether Mo would seek to repeat his 5,000m and 10,000m triumphs or attempt the 10,000m/marathon double.
After this, surely there is no choice; Britain needs its track terminator back.
