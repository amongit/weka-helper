What's it like to be in a rally car with Seb Loeb?

Jammy. There’s no other word for it. At last year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed I landed a passenger ride in a McLaren P1 with Jenson Button, becoming not only the first journalist in the world to travel in the Woking firm’s hypercar, but also still one of the very few to date to have been driven in it by the 2009 Formula One World Champion.
Then, two weeks before this year’s Festival of Speed, an invitation arrived from Citroen, asking if I’d like to take the passenger seat alongside Sebastien Loeb. That’s Sebastien Loeb nine times World Rally Champion, Pikes Peak hero and one of the greatest drivers ever.
The wheels would be a Citroen DS3 WRC car, and the location the Forest Rally stage.
There’s not much point in me telling you how much I enjoyed it, because as you can see if you watch the video at the top of this page, the whole thing made me laugh my head off.
It wasn’t just the speed that had me in hysterics, but the commitment Loeb demonstrated at every single one of the course’s twists and turns.

The next day the Frenchman won the prestigious Festival of Speed hillclimb shootout, despite the car he was driving spending much of the run sat on the limiter in top gear.
But it was his skills on the rally stage that will stay with me, as truly the most extraordinary automotive experience I’ve ever had.
Goodness knows how I'll top this next year.
