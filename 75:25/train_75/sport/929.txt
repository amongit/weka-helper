Bayern Munich midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri has revealed that Liverpool made an attempt to sign him from the German champions during the transfer window.
The Switzerland playmaker, who lines up against England in the euro 2016 qualifier on Monday night, revealed that last season's Premier League runners-up made the move to sign him before last summer's World Cup but were knocked back by Bayern
“Liverpool made a bid for me before the World Cup but Bayern put their foot down and told me, ‘We’re not going to sell you’," he said.
Shaqiri has struggled to hold down a regular place in the Bayern side since his move to Germany from Basle in 2012 but he says he is in no rush to leave Munich and may even extend his current contract.

“My contract runs until 2016 and I could possibly extend it. I will consider my decision during the winter break.”
Switzerland face England on Monday in their first competitive game of the post-Otmar Hitzfeld era and the 22-year-old says that the side is feeling confident under new coach Vladimir Petkovic.
“They will come over to Switzerland looking to win. But we will play our normal game – and we’ll be going for victory too.
"We are familiar with our formation as a team and we know what we have to do.
