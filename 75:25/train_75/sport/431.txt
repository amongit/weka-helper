Moses, who can play as an attacking midfielder or striker, has just one year left on his contract at Wigan and is free to leave if the club’s £10 million valuation is met.
Chelsea will not match that but will come close with a series of add-ons to the deal which Wigan could accept.
Wigan have already rejected the possibility of taking striker Romelu Lukaku on loan but it seems he might join Fulham – especially if Moses is signed – while his fellow Belgian, Kevin De Bruyne, is expected to go to Werder Bremen for the forthcoming campaign also on loan.
If Moses is signed it could end Chelsea’s interest in Bayer Leverusen’s Andre Schurrle and the Premier League club’s attention will switch to signing a right-back. Indeed a fee of around £8m is understood to have been agreed with Marseille for Cesar Azpilicueta, the 22-year-old captain of Spain’s Olympic team, but he has not spoken to Chelsea yet.
