Arsene Wenger is adamant there is no crisis in English football and has once again called for the away goals ruling to be abolished after his side were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16.
Arsenal failed to reach the latter stages for the fifth consecutive season after they were eliminated from the competition by the away goals rule following their 3-3 aggregate draw with Monaco this week.
The Arsenal manager says he was not in the mood to analyse why no English teams were able to reach the quarter finals after Manchester City and Chelsea were also beaten at the same stage of the competition.

But he does feel there could have been a different outcome for both Arsenal and Chelsea if the away goals ruling had not been there.
Wenger has urged Uefa to have a major re-think over the structure of the competition and feels the rule should only come into consideration after extra time.
• Arsenal must be tougher mentally - or be an also-ran • Welbeck's control is too sloppy too often • Ozil under fire over shirt-swap
Wenger said: “Two teams have gone out on away goals, which I think should be questioned because it’s a rule that is outdated now and that has to be changed. I’ve fought for that for a long time.

“It should count maybe after extra-time because this rule has been created in the 60s to encourage the teams to attack away from home. Since that football has changed. The weight of the away goal is too big today.
“In a direct knockout, it’s important that you’re very efficient and a bit lucky as well. None of the teams, apart from Barcelona, look to be superior in Europe today. Two other teams, Chelsea and Arsenal, could have gone through.
“I still think you can count [away goals] after extra-time like in the league cup in England.
“I think that the quality of the Premier League is very high and that physical demands are extreme. I’m not in the mood today to analyse too much what was wrong for English football. I don’t think there’s a lot wrong, we just have to now focus on our next targets.”

Wenger was also quick to play down suggestions that he would prefer his team to play in the Europa League following their exit from the Champions League.
Wenger added: “It is better that we are in the Champions league. It is as simple as that. It was just a little joke I made in French. To stay in Europe, you want to be in the Champions league and nowhere else.

“It was not mistranslated. Maybe if we had gone out in the group stage, we would still be in the Europa League. You cannot say anything anymore, in any press conference without a controversial situation! That is why no one says anything anymore in fact.”
