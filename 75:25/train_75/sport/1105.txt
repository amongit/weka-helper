US Open 2014: Fast-rising Matt Fitzpatrick in fantasyland after finishing as top amateur

It is fair to say that Matt Fitzpatrick will remember his final day in the non-paid ranks. The 19-year-old from Sheffield became the first golfer since Bobby Jones to hold low amateur medals for the US Open and the Open at same time.
Does it get any better than emulating the founder of Augusta, the greatest amateur ever who actually won the game’s oldest two majors in 1930? Well, in some ways it certainly did, as Fitzpatrick signed off with a one-under 69, which on a course as tough as Pinehurst is quite the achievement.
Fitzpatrick’s caddie, Lorne Duncan, held the Englishman’s arm aloft when he holed out a 15-footer for par on the 18th for an 11-over total, which handed him a top-50 finish. The crowd responded with gusto and Fitzpatrick’s smile only increased the volume. Evidently, it meant a lot.
“I didn’t know about the Bobby Jones connection until this morning and I was surprised and obviously delighted,” Fitzpatrick said, after being the only one of 11 amateurs in the field to make the cut. “Just to be mentioned in the same sentence as a legend like that is very special. I came here with the goal of making the cut and being leading amateur and to do so is really pleasing.”
After Sunday night’s presentation, the next stop was Charlotte airport and then a day flight from Washington DC to Heathrow. A night at the London airport will be followed by an early-morning flight on Tuesday to Cork and from there, the short drive to Fota Island where he will compete this week in the Irish Open as a professional.

Fittingly enough for someone who many believe still resembles a schoolboy, Fitzpatrick had some homework for the journey.
Although his adventure here at the 114th US Open was based in the realms of fantasy, as he played the first two rounds in the company of Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose and then another major champion in Louis Oosthuizen on Sunday – there was the reality for Fitzpatrick to consume. It says much about this young man that he is determined to learn from his week in dreamland.
“It was nice to get off to a good start today, birdieing the first,” he said. “But then I felt like I played really solid all week – the difference was I just holed some putts today and that’s what I’ve not done all week. Yet it’s hard to tell straight away. I’ll have a good look at my stats and see what I did well and what I did not do well and then draw my conclusions.”
As he talked, his parents, Russell and Susan, looked on proudly. Neither can accompany their eldest son to Ireland and in that respect this truly will be a coming-of-age experience. Apart from babysitting for his younger brother, Alex, this will be Fitzpatrick’s first “proper job” and he appreciates “that I will be playing for my living from now on”.
For the next month or so, he will accompanied by his agent Chubby Chandler, the ISM chief executive, who fulfilled a similar role when Rory McIlroy made the big leap. Inevitably, there has been a great deal of interest in Fitzpatrick from equipment and apparel companies, as well as sponsors and tournament promoters.
Fitzpatrick has six invites thus far, including the lucrative French Open in Versailles in two weeks’ time. At the start of that week he will try to qualify for the Open at Hoylake, having given up the invite he earned for winning the US Amateur by turning professional.
“My aim is to get my European Tour card from the invites,” Fitzpatrick said. It will be no surprise if he succeeds, although even if he falls short, there is a long-term plan for the teenager. There is an urgency, but there will be no panic.
“I’m excited more than daunted about next week,” he said. “And I’m glad that I can take some momentum from here. If I’d have missed the cut by miles it would have been a tough one to go into my first pro event not playing well. Four rounds of competitive golf is a big positive.”
