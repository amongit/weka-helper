The ball boy sparked a furious reaction from Hazard in the final minutes of the second-leg match with Chelsea trailing 0-2 on aggregate after Morgan refused to return an out-of -play ball.

The Belgium international appeared to kick the 17-year-old in the ribs in frustration and was promptly sent off by the referee Chris Foy with Morgan still rolling around in apparent pain.
But Morgan, it later emerged, had tweeted before the game boasting about his timewasting skills.
One pre-match tweet on his account reads: "The king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance #needed #for #timewasting."

Hazard and the teenager were interviewed by South Wales Police in the aftermath of the incident.
The ball boy, who was uninjured, was interviewed by officers in the presence of his father and made no complaint about what happened.
Hazard later apologised for his behaviour saying: "The boy put his whole body on to the ball and I was just trying to kick the ball.
"I think I kicked the ball and not the boy. I apologise."
It's not the first time the boy has mimicked the actions of his Premier League elders, though.
In March 2010, Morgan, alongside friends Corey Merrells and Liam Lazarus featured in a “Crossbar Compilation” video.
Morgan appears at 1.03 on the video and dinks the ball through a window before embarking on an extravagant celebration.

Within an hour of the incident Morgan had almost 60,000 Twitter followers, and a gaggle of former players were going on the site to give their opinion.
Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand and Everton captain Phil Neville both weighed in:
<noframe>Twitter: Rio Ferdinand - What have I just witnessed?! A ball,a ball boy,a player + a red card..u would never have imagined all that could go together in 1 sentence!</noframe>
<noframe>Twitter: phil neville18 - You can't kick the ballboy that's not right so i again agree with Chris foy red card!</noframe>
Stoke City striker Michael Owen also opined on what may have happened partially defending the Belgian:
<noframe>Twitter: michael owen - Both the kid and Hazard were in the wrong. Not having Hazard tried to hurt him though. He just tried to toe poke it out of his grip.</noframe>
BBC pundit Robbie savage took a similar line, tweeting:
<noframe>Twitter: Robbie Savage - First and foremost you can't kick a ballboy but hazard was surely just trying to get the ball back,wasn't malicious !</noframe>
And the always-entertaining Joey Barton chimed in almost immediately.
<noframe>Twitter: Joseph Barton - After reviewing last nights footage, I've come to the conclusion that the games gone. Ballboys aged 17, time wasting, then rollin round like</noframe>
Following the match Chelsea used their official Twitter account to question Foy’s decision to send Hazard off.

‘Has football gone mad? Hazard is sent off for kicking the ball under a ball boy attempting to smother the ball rather than return it,’ the Blues tweeted to their 1.8million followers.
The club later apologised and deleted the tweet from the account.
