Wales on a mission to be fittest side at the World Cup - and lift the trophy

There were a variety of conflicting emotions swirling around the bowels of the Stadio Olimpico in the hours after Wales's rout of Italy. Pride at a job well done, disappointment that it seemed destined to be not enough, regret at how they started the campaign against England, but most of all excitement of what is still to come from this team at the World Cup in six months' time.
Wales's coaches and players were unanimous in stating that they are far stronger than they were in 2011 when they were a red card away from reaching the final and equally unequivocal that there is still vast potential for improvement. There is no trepidation about facing Australia and England in Pool A. Indeed Wales's sights are trained beyond that.
"If we've got the players fit and available we're good enough to come out of that group and even to the win the World Cup," Warren Gatland said with typical bullishness.

It is a confidence born of the rate of their improvement over the course of this tournament. After staging their own version of the Alamo when resisting 45 phases of Irish pressure last week, they reprised the role of the Mexican army in the second half on Saturday as they overwhelmed Italy after half-time plundering seven tries.
In the final reckoning, it was not enough as they boosted their points difference to 53 giving both Ireland and England three-score victories to chase. For that rugby fans everywhere should thank them for setting up such a thrilling denouement as first Ireland and then England overtook that target.
Crucially, Wales's upward curve will accelerate from here on in. The plan was always to peak in September. Hence, the brutal tour to South Africa last summer and the physical 'beasting' administered to the squad during the autumn internationals. The physical benefits were in evidence in those contrasting second halves against Italy and Ireland.

"We'll be on an even higher plateau by the World Cup," Shaun Edwards, the defence coach, said. "The World Cup is the only time that we compete on an equal level to the southern hemisphere teams. They are together for four months every year. The longer we're together, the better we seem to be."
The stated goal is to be the fittest side at the World Cup. Their camps will involve living 2,250 metres above sea level in Switzerland, training in 40C heat in Qatar and returning to the spartan surroundings of Spala, which was their base before the 2011 tournament.
"We know when we get together for a long period of time, we are a bloody good team," Jamie Roberts, the centre, said.

"I think it showed against England that we were a bit rusty having two weeks prep together. Looking back to the last World Cup when we had that time together, we really worked hard in putting in the hard yards in terms of fitness and technically we know we are a really good side."
Asked if they were better now than four years ago, Roberts's reply was instant. "Definitely. The core of players are still together and there's a lot more experience now after the last World Cup."
Roberts was Wales's sole try-scorer in a first half where they did not have things their own way. Italy spoiled and scrapped to keep Wales's lead pegged at 14-13. Only those inside the visiting dressing room knew what was coming next.

"The great thing was the composure after half-time," Roberts said. "We knew that the first half was going to be difficult and to go in at half-time only one point up, all the boys knew we were about to break them and the patience we showed was good. That's a sign of a mature side."
Wales maintained a frightening tempo throughout the second half and Italy, to borrow some cycling parlance, were dropped. After Liam Williams scored on 47 minutes without an Italian finger being laid on him, you sensed trouble brewing. It duly arrived in disarmingly rapid fashion as George North helped himself to an 11'minute hat-trick.
Rhys Webb was the next to profit with a typical snipe before Sam Warburton and Scott Williams ran in from long range. The big 'what if' centres on Gareth Davies dropping an interception with three minutes remaining before Leonardo Sarto went up the other end of the field to score for Italy in what proved to be a crucial 14-point swing.
The credit Wales get for playing with such ambition and accuracy has to be tempered by the poverty of the opposition. As Edwards was keen to emphasise, Wales will not employ such sevens style tactics come the World Cup.
"The defence controls what the attack does," Edwards said. "If the defence isn't very good, you can attack like that. Do you think you could play that kind of rugby against South Africa? If we threw the ball around like that against South Africa, we would lose by 20 points."
