Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino insisted he is happy with Christian Eriksen after Denmark manager Morten Olsen's stinging criticism of the playmaker.
Olsen accused Eriksen of lacking impact on the field following the Euro 2016 qualifying loss to Portugal, but Pochettino has no such concerns.
"It's his (Olsen's) problem, not my problem," Pochettino said.
"My problem is to keep my players at a good level.
"I am very happy with Christian Eriksen. He's a very good professional. His commitment with the team, with the club, is full.

"I think he's consistent and I'm happy with his performances this season."
Eriksen scored the winner in Tottenham's most recent match, the 1-0 win over Pochettino's former club Southampton, which sends Spurs to Manchester City in optimistic mood.
Pochettino places no significance on last season's heavy defeats to City as he prepares to take his side to the Etihad Stadium.
Spurs lost 6-0 and 5-1 to Premier League champions City last term under Pochettino's predecessors Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood, but the Argentinian has wiped those results from his memory.
"The reality is I don't remember the results," Pochettino said.
"This is another season, another philosophy, another game and we need to arrive on Saturday with the idea to believe in our philosophy and style and try to get the points.
"It's history and it's a different game, different players.
"It's not important now to think in the past. It's important to look forward.
"I don't have any concerns about these results."
Spurs are unbeaten away from home this term, while City have won one and drawn one of their three games at the Etihad so far.
