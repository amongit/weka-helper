Red Bull should stop moaning about Formula One and play by the rules

In a world of instant reaction, of instant comment, it is very easy to trash something almost immediately. It was no different after Lewis Hamilton’s processional victory in the Australian Grand Prix.
The comments flooded in on Twitter. “What a dull race… Who wants to watch a two-car race?... This season is going to be awful”, are some of the family-friendly examples (one point is - when do people ever go on Twitter to say anything nice?). This was a view endorsed by several folk in the paddock, but most notably by Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal.
Generally speaking, Horner is a man worth respecting and listening to. He guided Red Bull to four years of excellence and his team are genuinely hampered by an awful Renault engine, some 100 horsepower slower than the Mercedes. He does care about the good of the sport.
But in this instance, should we be surprised that Horner is so readily railing against the rules? One of his cars did not make it to the grid while the other stuttered home to a distant sixth. This was not the fault of the rules, or of Mercedes, it was the fault of Red Bull and Renault. No-one else.

It is ludicrous to be having such a doom-laden debate after one race. Only a sport with such an extraordinary propensity to descend into self-loathing at the first sign of trouble could manage this. If the first day of the football season is a snooze-fest, full of 0-0 draws and cagey displays, Jose Mourinho doesn’t suddenly start demanding the rules of the beautiful game are rewritten.
Cast your mind back five years. The first race of 2010, held in Bahrain, was about as boring as they get. Fernando Alonso won (I think), and very little else happened. Some very distinguished commentators, whom I respect and admire, began speaking of the 10 ways to save Formula One. As it turned out, it was one of the most memorable, topsy-turvy seasons in history. Five drivers battled for the championship almost all year, with four in contention at the final race.
This is why we should do our best to be patient before casting judgement on an entire sport and its rulebook on the basis of one race. Last season was enjoyable enough with just two cars in it - Horner himself has said this.
Unhappy: Red Bull's Christian Horner wants rule changes to limit Mercedes
I don’t blame him, but Horner's principal motivation in this case is not the good of Formula One, as much as he does genuinely care about it. It is the performance of his stricken team. And the only way he and the rest can see to catch Mercedes is by slowing them down.
Horner fairly pointed out that when Red Bull were in front (and I agree, they had nothing like as big an advantage as Mercedes), the FIA sought to ban every innovation under the sun. It is part of an unwelcome tendency which has driven Adrian Newey, the greatest designer of his generation, away from the sport. But it isn’t that simple with Mercedes. They don’t appear to be exploiting any grey areas and their car is simply much better than anyone else's in every department.

2015 may not be a classic season. Mercedes, self-evidently, are a long way ahead. Most worryingly, Hamilton seems on the basis of Melbourne to comfortably have the edge on his team-mate Nico Rosberg (thank goodness for our sake that Hamilton is British).
But that is not a sufficient basis on which to penalise one team and one team alone. Because then, it stops being sport. It would have been like asking Steve Redgrave to row with one arm behind his back.

Inevitably, Formula One should look at how it can bring the teams closer in the long-term (ironically, the best mechanism in the past has been to leave the rules alone). It is not good for spectators or television audiences to see just two cars or one car in a race. We know the years of Michael Schumacher’s dominance did inflict some damage on the sport. Very few people would not like to see Red Bull, Ferrari, McLaren (the big powerhouses of Formula One) raise their game to catch Mercedes.
But you penalise anyone who ever manages to win consistently by penalising Mercedes now, in the middle of the season. Why would anyone bother to try and dominate if all you get is opprobrium?

Perhaps after five, six or seven races of dull processions it will be time to thoroughly assess how to bridge the gap for next season or the year after. It may be necessary to open up engine development fairly dramatically to at least give Red Bull and the others a chance (although this has the inherent dangers of sending costs up even further).
Yet it seems absurd to rubbish the entire sport, changing the rules mid-season, off the back of one race. That’s my instant reaction.
