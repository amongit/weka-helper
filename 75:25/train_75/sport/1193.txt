Rank your top four European leagues in order of technical ability. 1. Spain. 2. Germany. 3. France. 4. England.
Is FFP preventing English clubs signing the world's best players or are clubs just making mistakes in the transfer market? Or both? FFP is an issue for Man City. But like the other Premier League heavyweights they are spending too freely on players below the top echelon.
Suggest one single measure which can improve the results of English clubs in Europe? The religion of "excitement" has blinded English clubs to the need to defend in Europe. Scour the world for top centre-backs and strong, central midfielders.
Which of England's Champions League clubs this season would benefit from changing their manager this summer? Manuel Pellegrini is guilty of regression while Arsene Wenger is at least consistent in falling short with Arsenal.

Is FFP preventing English clubs signing the world's best players or are clubs just making mistakes in the transfer market? Or both? FFP should not handicap big English clubs particularly. As Man City have shown in a negative sense, it is vital you recruit the right players.
Suggest one single measure which can improve the results of English clubs in Europe? Tackling ties in a more tactically astute fashion. Arsenal and City were both undone by making the wrong calls.
Which of England's Champions League clubs this season would benefit from changing their manager this summer? You would have to say City, given how Pellegrini approached the first leg against Barca.

Is FFP preventing English clubs signing the world's best players or are clubs just making mistakes in the transfer market? Or both? FFP is not an issue. Manchester City, despite their Uefa-imposed restrictions, have spent £80m since last season, so that points to bad judgment and mistakes being made.
Suggest one single measure which can improve the results of English clubs in Europe? A core of home-grown players. Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea all benefited from this when winning Champions Leagues in recent years.
Which of England's Champions League clubs this season would benefit from changing their manager this summer? Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini is not a Champions League-winning coach. Like David Moyes was a top seven coach at Everton, Pellegrini is no more than a knock-out round coach.

Rank your top four European leagues in order of technical ability. 1. Spain 2. Germany. 3. England 4. Italy.
Is FFP preventing English clubs signing the world's best players or are clubs just making mistakes in the transfer market? Or both? Chelsea signed three players from last season’s finalists Atletico Madrid, although Thibaut Courtois was already a Blues player. Manchester City’s transfer policy has been a disaster.
Suggest one single measure which can improve the results of English clubs in Europe? Luck of the draw. Chelsea and Manchester City were both handed tough draws. Arsenal were not, but the fortunes of all European league fluctuate from year to year.
Which of England's Champions League clubs this season would benefit from changing their manager this summer? Arsenal. Nobody does glorious failure in Europe better than Arsene Wenger, but the Frenchman makes the same mistakes every year and it is beyond tedious.

Rank your top four European leagues in order of technical ability. 1. Spain. 2.Germany 3. Italy 4. England.
Is FFP preventing English clubs signing the world's best players or are clubs just making mistakes in the transfer market? Or both? Makes no difference. There is a pyramid in terms of where greatest players aspire to be, with Barcelona and Real Madrid at the top, and Bayern not far behind those two. The truly world class players pass through the Premiership en route to Nou Camp and Bernabeu.
Suggest one single measure which can improve the results of English clubs in Europe? Spanish government enforcing current proposal for fairer domestic TV rights deal. For all the doe-eyed fawning over Real and Barca, don’t ignore how they have manipulated the market to retain financial and competitive dominance – and pay overinflated fees and wages (albeit on the best players).
Which of England's Champions League clubs this season would benefit from changing their manager this summer? It’s clearly Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini may have created a less divisive atmosphere at the training ground, and he might be a jolly nice chap who is 'misunderstood' by us 'ever-so-unfair' English journalists, but the fact remains - City are no better in Europe now than under Roberto Mancini.
