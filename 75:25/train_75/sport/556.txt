Thousands of lovestruck words have been written about their beautiful passing game; fans and fellow professionals laud their desire to keep on winning after already reaching the heights; even the squad's children have been praised for their extraordinary cuteness.
But Alan Shearer went one step further during the BBC's post-game analysis of the Euro 2012 final, saying that we should not forget that the Spain squad have had "an unbelievable amount of sex".
He quickly corrected himself, apparently meaning to say that Spain have had "an unbelievable amount of success", but we all know the truth. Did you see the number of kids running around afterwards?
