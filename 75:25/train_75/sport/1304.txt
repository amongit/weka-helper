Jason Palmer will make history this week when he becomes the first one-handed chipper on the European Tour.
The 30-year-old from Leicester earned full playing rights by winning on the Challenge Tour earlier this year and makes his debut as a card-holder at the Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club on the border of the Kruger National Park.
Yet while the South African fans will doubtlessly be drawn initially to the big-name players such as Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen, Palmer’s unique style around the greens may soon build up a sizeable gallery.

“Hopefully they wont see me chipping too much as my game is built around fairways and greens,” Palmer said. “But if they do enjoy it and it is a big talking point, then great. People ask me why I chip one-handed but if I didn't there would be no way I’d be a professional golfer. It saved my career.”

It was when he was scratching around on the minor circuits that Palmer, a good amateur whose “chipping yips” had threatened to destroy his dream, was convinced to take away his left hand away. “I was with my friend Neil Chaudhuri and I was extremely low about the demise of my short game and the devastating effect that it was having on my scores, Palmer said.
“I showed him just how foolish the situation was as I clipped a few towards the pin nonchalantly with just one hand. Between us we came to the conclusion that it's a results-based game and that at the end of the day you have to do whatever gets the ball in the hole. So it was then that I decided I would use the one-handed method in tournament play and see what happened.”
While before he had been “guaranteed” to make at least a bogey if he missed the green, he began to enjoy the challenge of getting up and down. Two years ago he won three times on the Alps Tour and won the order of merit and then took his opportunity on the Challenge Tour.
Palmer goes one-handed from 40 yards and in, while he also goes one-handed from bunkers from 10 yards and in. There is nothing in the rule-book which disallows using one hand instead of two. There have been instances of pros putting with one hand - Mike Hulbert famously did so on the PGA Tour in the mid 90s - but golf’s historians have failed to come up with another professional on a main tour using the technique for chipping. However, Palmer is unashamed and sees no reason why to change when it has brought him this far.
“When I first switched, I thought it would only be a quick fix," Palmer said. “But here I am four years later and the feeling has still not returned with two hands. I have tried on numerous occasions to get both hands on the club but no matter how hard I try, my two-handed short game does not even compare to the touch and feel I have with my right hand alone.
“It's bizarre but I have accepted now that this will be the way I play the game. At the start I was worried what people would think, but no I don't care - all that’s relevant is the results. I cant wait to play on the European Tour to see how my scrambling stats compare to some of the world's greats.”
