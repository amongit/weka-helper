She stands all of 4ft 6in in her bespoke satin shoes, but little Claudia Fragapane had her Glaswegian audience utterly in thrall. Her name might sound like a viscous blend of butter and almonds, but it should soon become common currency far beyond the province of gymnastics as she adapts to life as a triple Commonwealth Games champion. Now that she clasps a victory on the vault to set alongside her team and all-around titles, life has seldom looked sweeter for England’s 16-year-old pocket rocket.
Never mind that her Italian father insists upon wearing an Azzurri football shirt when watching her routines, Fragapane has produced a series of performances here of a tariff and execution rarely seen from an English gymnast. Better yet, her triumph in triplicate was matched in the men’s competition by compatriot Max Whitlock, who emphatically eclipsed team-mate Louis Smith to seize his third gold, with a floor display that buttressed his reputation as a brilliant natural technician.
The 21-year-old European champion is not called ‘Mr Twist’ for nothing. After a magical sequence of air flares, Whitlock had one last flourish of a 3½-twist, deriving a maximum degree of torque from that 5ft 6in frame in a move that he landed to near perfection. It was a different class of gymnastics to the rest of the field, and one that suggested that he had begun to acquire the artistic style he was once said to lack.
Whitlock, having made a far greater contribution to the team win than his more celebrated rival Smith, also surpassed the Olympic silver medallist in a tense duel on the pommel horse. Only the most fleeting loss of rhythm on a handstand prevented him taking gold from Scotland’s Dan Keatings, who expiated some of the agonies of not being selected for the London Olympics with this rapturously-received home win.
But the greater glory belonged to Fragapane, whose two exquisitely-judged vaults merited a combined mark of 14.633, relegating Canada’s Elsabeth Black to second and Dipa Karmakar, of India – whose second vault earned the highest single score – to third.

“It doesn’t feel real at all,” she said. “I didn’t imagine all this would happen until I was older, so it has come as a shock. I am very determined, though. I like to make sure I get things right. The second I am down or tired in the gym, the coaches know to push me to improve. Then, when it comes to a competition, I am less likely to be fazed.”
Even her father, resplendent in his incongruous blue shirt, could not distract her from her task. “He can wear what he wants,” she said, laughing. “I just hope that nobody sees it.”
For Whitlock, a self-effacing soul from Hemel Hempstead, this achievement was proof of the talent he had displayed in winning gold on the pommel at the European Championships in Sofia earlier this year. He, like Fragapane, seemed almost nonplussed by the magnitude of his feat. “The adrenalin rushing into me was just unbelievable,” he said.
It could yet be a quadruple gold for Whitlock when he sets his mind to the parallel bars final on Friday. But on Thursday night there was a satisfaction in beating Smith on the pommel, after the favourite, making his return from his two-year sabbatical, ended his Games on a rather underwhelming note.
Smith was impressive until the end of his stretches and spindles, losing his focus and botching the dismount to ensure he would seal no better than bronze. The 25-year-old, for whom modesty is not always a strong suit, explained that he had merely been over-ambitious.
“Dan, Max and I are in a league of our own on this apparatus,” Smith said. “I’m not being big-headed or anything, but I could have done one of my easier routines and guaranteed a medal. But I wanted to see where I was at, how my mind was, so I went for the harder option and I almost did it.”
Smith, who translated the trappings of celebrity he acquired in London into a winning appearance on Strictly Come Dancing, flatters himself slightly.
He is a part-time sportsman these days: indeed, the Commonwealths represent his sole competitive outing of 2014, before he returns to the circus of easy publicity on the BBC’s impending gymnastics-themed show, Tumble. But he was decisively beaten here by Keatings, who was virtually flawless in gaining a score of 16.058 to indicate that, having been snubbed for London, he could heal those wounds come the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
“I did have to think about my career seriously in 2012,” Keatings reflected. “I was really down. I was thinking about finishing there and then. I sat down with my coach and he convinced me to stay on. So, I decided I would give it one more shot and put everything into Glasgow. There was a lot of pressure, because Louis, on his day, can smash anybody.” Not here, however, as Smith ceded the stage to the stars of the future.
