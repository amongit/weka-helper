The control and disciplinary body also banned six players for varying terms, including English duo Tom Ince and Steven Caulker, and two Serbian coaches after ugly scenes marred the end of the European Championship play-off.
Tottenham Hotspur defender Steven Caulker has been banned for two games while Blackpool midfielder Tom Ince has been banned for one game for their role in disturbances on the pitch following the final whistle.
Both players will miss England's opening game of next summer's European Championships against Italy on June 5 while Caulker will also miss the game against Norway three days later.
The punishment was met with dismay by many within English football. Manchester United defender Roi Ferdinand tweeted to say: "Uefa are not serious at all on racism. Fines do not work at all. They have zero impact on federations/clubs/fans/players."

The FA had reported the racist abuse to UEFA plus a number of other incidents. Full-back Danny Rose, who was dismissed after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in anger, complained he had been particularly targeted. Rose claimed he was subjected to monkey chants throughout the match and as he left the pitch.
General secretary Alex Horne said afterwards that the FA would have to consider whether England should play in Serbia in the future.

The Uefa Control and Disciplinary Body has also suspended Serbia fitness coach Andreja Milunovic from all football-related activities for two years, the second of which is suspended for a probationary period of three years. FIFA will be requested to extend this decision so as to give it a worldwide effect.
Serbia assistant coach Predrag Katić has also been suspended from all football-related activities for two years, the final six months of which are suspended for a probationary period of three years.
Serbia Under-21 players Nikola Ninkovic, Filip Malbasic, Ognjen Mudrinski and Goran Causic have been suspended for between two and four games.
Uefa says an appeal may be lodged against these decisions within three days of the dispatch of the reasoned decision.
