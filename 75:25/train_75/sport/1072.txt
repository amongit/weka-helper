Calling the Williams sisters 'scary' isn't just sexist, it's racist too

It’s not often that sports stars stick their necks on the line by challenging inequality. Last week, Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpishchev disparagingly branded Venus and Serena Williams the ‘Williams brothers’ on a Russian TV chat show. Upon hearing about this, Serena batted back, calling his comments "extremely sexist, racist and bullying”. But this wasn’t just a war of words. The Women's Tennis Association made sure Tarpishchev apologised, fining him $25,000 (£15,501) and disqualifying him from working in an organisational capacity for the next year.
After a week in which the football world debated the ethics of welcoming back an unrepentant convicted rapist with open arms, this stance from the World Tennis Association is a much needed relief. In an ideal world, sexist and racist bigotry would be combatted through education. Until then, punitive measures get the job done.

This fascination with the Williams sisters’ bodies has followed them throughout both of their careers. All women are subject to an unattainable standard of femininity, but femininity is racially coded, and it’s coded white. In the Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf identified that standard to be constructed by advertisers, occupied with selling us a dream. From Disney princesses to magazine covers, to the beauty counter that doesn’t cater to the colour of our skin, women who aren’t white are constantly reminded that participating in femininity isn’t supposed to be for us.
The Williams sisters are experts in their field, and have continued to achieve. Their physiques are the result of years of training, and the training has clearly paid off. If they were men, that would be that. But they’re women, so detractors try to undermine them solely on the basis of their looks. This is radicalised sexism in its most insidious form.

Framed as a joke, the Williams sisters are positioned as humourless if they don’t take the comments in good faith. But ‘jokes’ that need to be explained and explained are never just jokes. The ones that resonate with us most echo what we already believe about the world. Good humour punches up, not down.
Poor humour bullies and relies on lazy, tired stereotypes. Tarpischev’s so-called ‘joke’ belies his ignorance. There’s no typical gendered body- only unattainable standards that we’re encouraged to hold ourselves to. A walk down your local high street will prove that broad shoulders, height and muscle definition isn’t the sole reserve of men.
As well as calling the Williams sisters men, Tarpischev also insinuated that they were ‘scary’ to look at- an age-old insult aimed at black people in general. These unfounded assumptions assert that black people, by virtue of being black, are scary, intimidating, and threatening - inadvertently forcing legitimate feelings of anger to be repressed, lest we ignite those racist tropes.
The Women's Tennis Association is setting the right example. The measures taken against Tarpischev may seem extreme, but it’s in line with the comments he made. Cruel, discriminatory jokes from senior figures in any profession set a standard of what those who work in it will let slide. They create a hostile, unwelcoming environment to those whose identities are being attacked.
That this man took a pop at two of the most powerful black women in tennis sends a signal to young, black women hopefuls: you’re not welcome. Accountability is crucial for any organisation to progress. Let’s hope that all sports organisations follow the World Tennis Association’s lead.
