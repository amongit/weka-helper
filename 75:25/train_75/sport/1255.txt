Louis van Gaal was a Tottenham fan - and five other things we learned from Manchester United manager

Van Gaal was a boyhood Spurs fan
The young King Louis might have grown up at a time when Dutch clubs were on the brink of a halcyon era, but as a child he had eyes for only one club: Tottenham Hotspur, and the great team of the 1960s which won the Double and the Cup Winners' Cup. "I was a great fan of Tottenham Hotspur, and a great fan of Jimmy Greaves," he reveals. "Unbelievable. It was on our television! The FA Cup! I watched Tottenham and of course United, George Best, Bryan Robson and after that David Beckham. But as a boy I was more a fan of Tottenham Hotspur. I’m sorry to say that! Nice white shirt!" Then again, that wasn't enough to persuade him to take the Spurs job when it was offered to him last year.

United is his last job in football
Van Gaal is 63 now, and insists that Old Trafford will be his last job in football before retirement. “I am also old - this is my last job," he said. "For sure. I have to pay attention to my kids, my grandchildren but also to my wife. They deserve it. Now I cannot pay that attention. I was not at the birthday of my grandson for example. I don’t like it.”

United players have five meetings with coaching staff before every game
The level of detail in United's preparation under Van Gaal is truly extraordinary. According to the man himself, every player has at least five meetings with coaching staff before every match United play: a presentation of Ryan Giggs' gameplan; a 'unit meeting' with defenders, midfielders and strikers; a set-play specific meeting; a meeting at the hotel to "give consciousness (understanding) to what we have to do" and individual meetings with staff. And don't even get him started on the post-match meetings...

Van Gaal sets off airport metal detectors
No wonder Louis is called 'The Iron Tulip'. An operation to repair a dodgy hip means that whenever he passes through an airport metal detector, Van Gaal receives some unwanted attention. "I don’t want to travel," he says. "Everyone wants to touch my body in the airports; it is always peeping because I have an artificial hip. I am the only one who has been controlled every time when we fly. I don’t like it." Good job United haven't had any of those pesky European trips this season, then.

Carrick and Rooney are his 'trainer-coaches'
Van Gaal's affection for his players is evident in his interview, and he reserves particular praise for Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney's thoughtful approach to their football. Indeed, the way he talks makes it sound as if he has two managers-in-waiting on his books. "Most of my players of my selection are open and that’s very nice," he says. “Carrick is more or less a trainer-coach. He is also willing to talk about shapes and systems. That’s nice. Rooney also."

Three at the back appears to be dead
Van Gaal's dalliance with 3-5-2, so disastrous at the start of the season seems to be over. Instead, he says the system he deployed against Tottenham - a 4-3-3 with the ball, and a 4-1-4-1 without - is his favoured tactic. “I am the most flexible manager you can imagine," he says. "When the players are coming with good arguments, I change my opinion.”
