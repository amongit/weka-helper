Located in the west of the Olympic Park and costing an estimated £44 million to build, the handball venue is one of the most intriguing of those used during the Games.
It is designed by MAKE architects, which was founded by Ken Shuttleworth, best known for his work on the Gherkin building in London (30 St Mary Axe) while working with Sir Norman Foster.
Clad in more than 3,000 sq m of recycled copper – to help develop a “rich natural colour as it ages” the venue features a an eye-catching concourse level which enables spectators outside the venue to look in, while also being illuminated at night.
The Arena will host the early rounds of the handball, while also housing the fencing discipline of the modern pentathlon. But to pull off this transformation requires plenty of organisational work, including the removal of the handball field-of-play mat, the laying of 10 fencing pistes and the installation of technology necessary for such an event.
Once the Games are completed the Handball Arena should provide a lasting legacy to the area with plans for it to become a sports centre used by the community, for training athletes and for hosting small-to-medium sized events.
An attractive venue that boosts the community long after the Games are completed ticks two very important boxes for UK taxpayers footing the bill.
