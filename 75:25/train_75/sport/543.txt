The FA and its German counterpart, the DFB, voted against Uefa’s controversial plan to expand Euro 2016 to 24 teams, the Uefa president Michel Platini revealed on Saturday. The decision was passed by the 2009 Uefa Congress in Copenhagen.
On hearing that Germany’s coach, Joachim Loew, had criticised Uefa’s decision, Platini said: “He shouldn't play it (Euro 2016) then, in that case. It's a decision that was taken by the vast majority. Two or three associations – like England, Germany, the big ones – weren't in favour, but of the 54, 51 actually supported the tournament. So, in any democracy, when the vast majority are in favour, you go forward with it even if England or Germany aren't in favour.”
Platini, who is in Nice for Sunday’s draw, added: “We've gone from 16 to 24 teams, and this was a proposal from Ireland and Scotland back in 2007. They wanted a 24-team tournament. We can have 24 very good teams, so this tournament can be a success.
"From the dry-run this morning, I realised there'll be a lot of pressure on teams. There are some very strong teams. The five or six biggest teams don't have much to worry about...But 24 teams will be as good as 16 teams.’’
France qualify automatically as hosts but have been placed in Pot Five and will play games to give them significant tests.

“It's not easy for teams who are in that position of not having to qualify,’’ added Platini. “It's a good proposal from Uefa. They can play these matches home and away, a good thing. They came up against Portugal, Denmark and Israel, and Armenia, in the dry run today.’’
