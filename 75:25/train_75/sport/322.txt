Scotland's Gavin Rumgay made an incredible comeback from two games down against Canada's Pierre-Luc Theriault in the men's team event of the table tennis at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
Sensing victory, the nine-time national champion celebrated a crucial point against his Canadian rival by lifting his shorts into a 'mankini' pose, exposing his stripy underwear underneath.
Upon winning the game, the 29-year-old then proceeded to roll on the ground before leaping up to dance to the Proclaimers' song "I would walk 500 miles".
