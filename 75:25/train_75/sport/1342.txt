Andy Murray leads Britain to Davis Cup victory over United States

Whatever the merits of last year’s Scottish independence debate, British tennis is stronger for the union.
That much cannot be doubted after Andy Murray delivered his second masterclass of the weekend, cutting the 6ft 10in John Isner down to size in straight sets, and so completing a superb 3-1 win over the US.
The Americans are no longer the mighty force of old, as their team captain Jim Courier is well aware. In 1992, Courier combined with Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and John McEnroe to win the title in Fort Worth, and the modern generation cannot hold a candle to that lot.
But that doesn’t make them pushovers. For one thing, they can call upon the Bryan brothers – the most successful doubles team in history – to virtually guarantee one point per tie.
And their singles depth, with four men in the world’s top 50, is still better than most. So for Great Britain to knock them out twice in successive years is a serious achievement.
Murray v Isner: as it happened
To be in the quarter-finals for the second year when that hadn’t happened for about 40 years [actually 28, between 1986 and 2014] is incredible,” said Murray after the match. “It was one of the most special atmospheres I’ve ever played in.”
Isner’s chances of winning yesterday’s match had looked so remote, after his five-hour defeat to James Ward on Friday, that even Jamie Murray virtually wrote him off on Saturday night, suggesting that “I don’t think he’s going to be exactly back-flipping out of bed to play Andy”.
With nothing to lose, Isner came out swinging like an Australian batsman in a PowerPlay. He made a sweet connection with the ball in a first set that featured 12 aces and ten other clean winners from his racket.
Remarkably, though, Isner still found himself a set down after 64 minutes.
He must have wondered how that happened, considering that he generated seven break points – three of them also set points – to Murray’s zero. But Murray managed to hang tough and then raised his game in a staccato tiebreak that featured 18 legitimate shots in 11 points.
That really broke the back of the job. Isner knew that he had thrown his best stuff out there and come up with nothing. Statistically the worst returner on the ATP tour, he had only broken Ward’s serve once in 37 attempts on Friday, and he never seriously threatened to do so again as Murray completed his 7-6, 6-3, 7-6 victory with an ace out wide.
“There is a real synergy within the team,” said Murray afterwards, “and that builds the emotion and the togetherness. It gives you that extra incentive to perform and go out there to fight for every point. Nobody gave up, everyone played every point very hard and I thought we deserved to win.”
Winning team: Andy Murray with his Davis Cup team-mates
Davis Cup rules demand that if the tie is decided in straight sets in the fourth match, the dead rubber must still be played. But Ward, who is down to begin the qualifying tournament in Indian Wells tomorrow, retired after winning the first set against Donald Young. Not only did his knee hurt after Friday’s exertions; he had a plane to catch too.
Next up will be the French, who completed their own 3-0 victory over Germany yesterday. Great Britain will host that quarter-final in the week after Wimbledon and it will be interesting to see whether they decide to come back to Scotland or alternatively find a grass-court venue that would take advantage of Murray’s mastery of the surface.
“Grass is a surface I really like,” said Murray. “I think it’s a good surface for Dom [Inglot] as well with his serve. I wouldn’t say the French players love the grass outside of [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga. I don’t think [Gaël] Monfils is as comfortable on that surface. I don’t think [Gilles] Simon is that comfortable on it.
“So I think grass might be a good surface, but we’ll have to see, because playing in front of a crowd like this also makes a difference and it helps. If we can’t guarantee that at a grass venue maybe it makes sense to play it somewhere where we can get that.”
In all probability, Wimbledon would be impractical, given that the courts will be worn down by the tournament itself. And British captain Leon Smith yesterday suggested that it would be good to take the tie to a venue where people “will really have a hunger to see tennis”.

What an amazing weekend... So happy and proud to be a part of it... Thanks to everyone for all the support.. Bring on France
The Nottingham Tennis Centre, Eastbourne’s Devonshire Park and Edgbaston Prior Club in Birmingham would be the obvious contenders.
“Atmosphere is great,” said Smith, “but it would be even better to be in the semi-finals. So we have to pick a surface that Andy, Wardy and the core doubles group agree on. We’ll put our heads together over the next week, then go to the suits [at the Lawn Tennis Association] and ask them to make it happen.”
