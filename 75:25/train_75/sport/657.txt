Swansea City ballboy Charlie Morgan unlikely to cash in on instant fame following Eden Hazard encounter

But do not expect the 17-year-old to cash in on the repute/notoriety of being the Swansea City ballboy who was kicked in the ribs by Eden Hazard in Chelsea’s Capital One Cup exit on Wednesday night.
His standing as the son of the club’s biggest shareholders will almost certainly guard against the perils of capitalising on instant fame.

Martin Morgan and his wife, Luisa, own 22.5 per cent of the Premier League club and are well-known members of the Swansea community.

Lifelong fans, the couple amassed their fortune - reported to be £42m in 2008 - through owning and selling a travel agency and then investing in boutique hotels.
They transformed the Swansea's Victorian Port Authority building into a stunning hotel called Morgans which is now regarded as one of the best in the City. Their mansion on Three Cliffs Bay on the beautiful Gower peninsula is just as eye-catching.
The couple were part of the consortium which took control of the club in 2008, setting the Swans free to fly into a fairytale which has taken them to the Premier League and now to the their first major Cup final in their 101-year existence.
Charlie, then 12, was soon deployed as a ballboy, a role he maintained until the end of last season. As he approaches his 18th birthday, Charlie attends a college in Swansea.
As he indicated on his Twitter feed, Charlie was only called up on Wednesday as stand-in due to another ballboy not being able to get to The Liberty Stadium because of the snow.
It was one of Morgan’s celebratory tweets in reaction to his call-up which pointed the spotlight firmly at their club and their management.
<noframe>Twitter: Charlie Morganâ&bdquo;¢ - The king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=needed" target="_blank">#needed</a> <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=for" target="_blank">#for</a> <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=timewasting" target="_blank">#timewasting</a></noframe>
"The king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance #needed #for #time wasting," he wrote.
Sitting in the Sky Sports booth, the former England manager Glenn Hoddle didn’t need 140 characters to make up his own mind: "He's very slow, he rolls the ball deliberately slowly back to goalkeeper, he's bent, mark my words,” said Hoddle.
"He's been told, the ball boy would been told to do that. The Chelsea players were aware of what was going on…. do that as a management team, I know for a fact in European games, you will tell people who are instructing ball boys that if you're winning game, don't get the ball back quickly."
Michael Laudrup, the Swansea manager, was quick to shoot down that theory. "No, no. Definitely not," he said. A club spokesman pointed out that Charlie “has been a ballboy for about six seasons and there’s never been a complaint before”.
After the match, and after being cleared by the medical staff who described him as “fine” despite him clutching his ribs in apparent agony as he was led away from the pitch, Charlie was invited to the Chelsea dressing room.
Hazard apparently apologised to Morgan and vice versa, before the lad and his father were interviewed by South Wales Police.
Realising it was already developing into a major, if bizarre, news story, the pair declined to press charges and the a club spokesman said “we consider the matter dealt with”.
Charlie was spirited away from the press and today, with threats and insults bombarding the social network, it was announced he wouldn’t be conducting any interviews.
That is probably very, very wise. Celebrity Big Brother will have to look elsewhere.
