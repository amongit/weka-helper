Floyd Mayweather's Rocky-style training videos

Floyd Mayweather may be a five-division world champion and the highest paid sportsman on the planet, but he's not even the most famous boxer of his generation.
No, that honour goes to the indefatigable Rocky Balboa, who has been entertaining film lovers with his bouts since 1976. So enduring is the pugnacious pugilist's appeal that his fights were still selling out cinemas 30 years later (Rocky Balboa was an unexpected commercial and critical success in 2006).
If there's one thing the Rocky films can teach, it's how to motivate yourself ahead of a big fight. So perhaps it makes sense that Floyd Mayweather appears to be turning to the fictional source ahead of his big money bout with Manny Pacquiao on May 2.
Mayweather has posted a video to Instragram that shows him preparing for the fight by using Rocky-style 'back to basics' training techniques.
Alongside a traditional boxer's workout of ring practice and bag work, Mayweather can be seen chopping wood to hone his muscles.

The vignette is reminiscent of a scene from Rocky IV, when the eponymous hero goes back to basics at a training camp in the sub-zero Russian wilderness while training for a fight with the steroid-enhanced Ivan Drago.

Mayweather also published a video that shows him pounding the streets of his hometown at night.

Unfortunately, it doesn't involve him shadow boxing with hundreds of kids at the top of a flight of steps...

Another video in the series shows Mayweather engaged in more orthodox boxer training:

The videos mark a departure for Mayweather's account, which is normally filled with outlandish pictures that document his extravagant purchases.
