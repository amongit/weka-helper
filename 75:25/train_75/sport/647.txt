Michael Carrick injury has Manchester United considering Fredy Guarin

Manchester United’s calamitous season has been dealt a further blow with fears that Michael Carrick will be sidelined for a month with ankle ligament damage sustained during Wednesday’s Capital One Cup defeat by Sunderland.
With Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie struggling to prove their fitness in time to return from injury against Cardiff City next Tuesday, the loss of Carrick has left United manager David Moyes contemplating midfield reinforcements before the transfer deadline a week today.
The England midfielder is expected to be sidelined for at least two weeks with the injury, which occurred when his right ankle gave way when landing on the Astroturf at the side of the Old Trafford pitch during the semi-final penalty-shoot out defeat. Initial tests suggest he will be out for up to a month, forcing him to miss the Premier League clash at Arsenal on Feb 12 and potentially the Champions League last-16 first-leg tie against Olympiakos in Athens 13 days later.
Having only recently returned from a six-week lay-off following surgery on an Achilles tendon problem, Carrick’s latest setback will force Moyes to delay plans to restore Phil Jones to his natural position at centre half.
And with Inter Milan keen to offer Colombian midfielder Fredy Guarín in exchange for Javier Hernández, Moyes is considering his options for the rest of the transfer window.

Marouane Fellaini, the £27.5 million August signing from Everton, is close to a first-team return following surgery to correct a wrist problem last month. But while the Belgian has an outside chance of being fit to face Cardiff next week, it is understood that the trip to Stoke City on Feb 1 is a more realistic return date.

The absences of Rooney and Van Persie have coincided with United’s slide down the Premier League table and exits from the FA Cup and Capital One Cup this month. Van Persie is back in training following seven weeks out with a thigh injury, but is not expected back until the Stoke game.
And although Rooney has also resumed training after a three-week groin injury lay-off, his prospects of facing Cardiff are only 50-50.
Rio Ferdinand continues to be sidelined with a knee injury, so with captain Nemanja Vidic suspended, Moyes will again be without a host of senior players against Cardiff.
