Paula Radcliffe sets sights on 2012 marathon medal
Paula Radcliffe tells BBC Sport's Mike Costello she is planning to race in the marathon at London 2012 and is hoping to be in medal contention.
The marathon world record holder will be 38 when the Olympics begin in July, and tells Costello she feels an Olympic medal is "the thing that's missing" from her career, a feeling enhanced by media criticism of her performances at previous Games in Athens and Beijing.
Radcliffe remains realistic about her chances, however, saying she understands her body will not cope with the kind of training regime needed to set a world record time, and is aiming to "be healthy on the day and enjoy it".
