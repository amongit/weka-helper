England's 11-match winning streak came to an end as France came from two goals down to win the under-21s friendly 3-2 in Brest.
Tottenham centre-forward Harry Kane scored against the run of play midway through the first half and added a second little more than a minute later to take his under-21s tally to eight goals in 10 appearances.
Tom Ince was the provider of both but was powerless to prevent the score becoming Spurs 2 Arsenal 2 at Stade Francis Le Bl√©, as Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo pulled one back after 30 minutes and struck his second from close range before the interval.
France, a team who missed out on qualification for the Euro 2015 finals in the Czech Republic, completed their comeback as substitute Kingsley Coman struck 17 minutes from time.
It was the first defeat for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions and England Under-21s' first since the last European tournament in Israel in 2013 - a run of 15 games. The only blip in the meantime was a draw in Finland in September 2013. England beat Portugal 3-1 in Burnley last Thursday for an 11th straight win and Southgate made five changes, with Kane among those coming in.

There was torrential rain in western France and England had to withstand wave after wave of Les Bleus attacks as their impressive winning record faced a fierce test. Yet it was England who showed their pedigree with with their first glimpse of goal. Ince dropped deep and fed Kane in the left channel and the Tottenham striker showed composure to lift the ball over the on-rushing France goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.
A second followed swiftly when Ince turned brilliantly on receiving Nathaniel Chalobah's pass inside the edge of the area and then fired across goal with Kane applying the finishing touch on the line.
France halved their deficit with a deserved goal when Benjamin Mendy clipped the ball to the back post and Antoine Conte's cross was tucked in by Sanogo.
Chalobah, the highly rated Chelsea midfielder on loan at Burnley, departed injured soon afterwards with Jake Forster-Caskey of Brighton coming on in his place and another premature change was required when Ben Gibson went off, with West Ham's Carl Jenkinson coming on for the Middlesbrough defender.
France levelled after Jonathan Bond's save from Jordan Veretout found Paul-Georges Ntep de Madiba. The winger turned the ball into the six-yard box where Sanogo pounced. It was no less than France deserved.
Sanogo fired into the side-netting as France pressure continued in the second half. The English resistance was finally broken when Ntep de Madiba ran at the visiting defence and fed Coman, who side-footed into the corner for what proved to be the winner.
