GB v USA Davis Cup clash could produce family affair with Andy Murray and Jamie set to face Bryan brothers

Great Britain’s upcoming Davis Cup match against the USA is likely to produce a collector’s item: a doubles encounter between two opposing sets of brothers that brings new meaning to the phrase “sibling rivalry”.
That, at least, was the tip on Wednesday from Leon Smith, captain of the Aegon Great Britain Davis Cup team. Speaking to reporters in Melbourne, Smith suggested that Jamie Murray was in pole position to partner younger brother Andy – who is seeded sixth for the Australian Open – against the Bryan twins in what promises to be the pivotal rubber of the tie.
“We have a lot of options in doubles, and when everyone’s clustered together [rankings-wise], you have to go on form,” Smith said. “There’s still a bit of time to go, but Jamie has probably had the strongest last six months. I watched him on the weekend [when Jamie Murray and his partner John Peers beat Kei Nishikori and Alex Dolgopolov to lift the Brisbane title] and he was playing as well as I’ve seen him in a long time.
“No offence to the doubles specialists, but you probably want Andy to be part of the doubles team, as long as his match on Friday doesn’t go too long. And then it’s a question of who goes best with him. The two Murrays are a strong option together and Jamie also has a decent record against the Bryans: he’s had a couple of recent victories against them.”
The tie – which will be played from March 6-8 at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow – is a rematch of the first‑round encounter last year in San Diego, which Great Britain won 3-1. Yet there are likely to be some ­important differences this time around: not just the location but the indoor conditions and the anticipated availability of American No 1 John Isner, who missed the last match with an ankle problem.

Smith is also considering mixing up his own tactics by picking either Liam Broady, 21, or the 20-year-old Kyle Edmund – who both won their opening matches in the Australian Open qualifying tournament overnight – as a reserve singles player.
“To me, the situation feels a lot brighter than it has before,” Smith said. “We’ve got Andy playing really well at the moment, significantly ahead of where he was 12 months ago, while James Ward [now ranked No 101] is on the verge of cracking the top 100 for the first time.
“Whoever the Americans pick as their second singles player, whether it’s Sam Querrey, Donald Young or Steve Johnson, I’d back Wardie to get a result there. Then you’ve got the doubles guys going well [on top of Jamie Murray’s Brisbane success, Jonny Marray won a title of his own in Chennai at the weekend] and a couple of young singles players on the rise.”
At the same time, Smith emphasised that he would not be considering the possible new British recruit Aljaz Bedene for selection in Glasgow, even if Bedene pulls off the unlikely feat of clearing all the required bureaucratic hurdles in the next couple of weeks. A Slovenian with a career-best ranking of No 71, Bedene’s application for British citizenship is expected to be approved early this year.
“It would be too soon to make that decision when Aljaz is still ranked lower than our No 2,” Smith said of Bedene, who is at No 116 but showed his quality by finishing as runner-up to Stan Wawrinka in Chennai. “I have no idea how long it will take for his papers to come through, and then the International Tennis Federation would have to approve his switch. Until it becomes a realistic possibility, it’s not something we’re talking about.”
