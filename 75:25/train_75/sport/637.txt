India v Bangladesh: Virat Kohli wakes up to fulfil role as natural born leader at Cricket World Cup

A born winner. A man for the big occasion. Makes his runs when they are most needed. Took on Mitchell Johnson and won. A born leader, too. Of which England cricketer are these statements being made?
Well, yes, exactly. Nobody springs to mind, which is part of the reason why England are now engaged in a World Cup post-mortem and not a quarter-final. But every one of those labels can be attached to India’s Virat Kohli, who is being phased in as the captain of cricket’s superpower.
Kohli is described as the successor to Sachin Tendulkar, which applies in the sense that Kohli has become India’s No 4 batsman in Test cricket and reels off centuries. But Kohli exudes passion, acts brashly, fields dynamically, and enjoys not only captaincy but all the baubles of international stardom – his girlfriend is the current queen of Bollywood – as Tendulkar never did.

It must be so much easier to win the World Cup – not that any Englishman would know – if you have done something similar in your youth. In 2008 Kohli captained India to the Under-19 World Cup. They faced some tough opposition: New Zealand had Kane Williamson, Tim Southee, Corey Anderson and Trent Boult, the pillars of their successful World Cup run this time under Brendon McCullum.
Only once have England won this Under-19 World Cup, even though they have often been the only professional team in the competition, while other countries have sent amateur schoolboys.
It was not such a huge step for Kohli, then, when he won the senior World Cup in 2011 as the most junior member of India’s triumphant team. Suresh Raina and Ravi Ashwin, who are also due to play in their quarter-final against Bangladesh in Melbourne tomorrow, were members of India’s cup-winning squad; but only Kohli and the captain MS Dhoni survive from the side who won the final on that heady night in Mumbai.

Kohli grew up in Delhi and, like a number of middle-class Indian boys that must be running into millions, was sent to learn cricket at a private academy. What made him stand out was his toughness – the toughness that had him scoring four centuries in the four Tests in Australia this winter and blowing kisses (not bowing his knee) to Mitchell Johnson, as well taking over the Test captaincy when Dhoni retired from the format.
The caveat is that Australian pitches in the series against India, including Adelaide where Kohli scored two hundreds in one epic Test, were as flat as any in living memory. His technical idiosyncrasy was not exposed – that of not bringing his bat down straight but in something approaching a semi-circle, which James Anderson exploited in England last summer, limiting Kohli to 134 runs in his 10 Test innings.
A defining moment came when Kohli was trying to secure a place in the Delhi team, aged 18, and had reached 40 by the close of play one day, approaching his maiden first-class fifty. The same day his father died. Kohli, after grieving at home, decided to go back next morning and resume his innings. He reached 90 before being given out caught behind, erroneously it is said, and thus established himself.

India have two sides: India, and India-on-holiday. Kohli was dormant in the superfluous tri-series in January between Australia, England and India-on-holiday, not reaching double figures. As soon as India began their defence of the World Cup, with the winner-takes-all-the-prestige match against Pakistan, Kohli made a match-winning hundred.
In winning all six of their qualifying games, India set a national ODI record in bowling out their opponents five consecutive times, suggesting this is the strongest attack they have ever deployed. Their three pace bowlers can hit 140kph (87mph) and move the ball around, while Ashwin and Ravi Jadeja have been the best pair of spinners in the tournament.
Bangladesh have made the biggest improvement in their brief history. In two consecutive innings Mohammad Mahmudullah, going down on one knee to cover-drive like an old-time West Indian, has scored Bangladesh’s first two World Cup centuries; their newcomers, like Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman and Taskin Ahmed, have skill and spirit; and Mashrafe Mortaza has led gallantly. But they may come down to earth in Melbourne.

Kohli, still only 26, has scored 22 one-day centuries – way more than the whole England team combined – at an average of 52 and a strike-rate of 89.
Sure, he has scored most of those hundreds in Asia, on pitches manufactured for batting and with less than vast boundaries, but he still deserves to be ranked sixth in the highest all-time ODI averages.
Add his 10 centuries from only 33 Tests and Kohli is almost one-third of the way to breaking Tendulkar’s record of 100 international hundreds. It is a world away from getting a nice contract on a county staff before anything has been achieved – on the basis of promise not performance – and attending courses at Loughborough, without ever winning a highly pressurised game.
