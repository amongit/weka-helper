Brazil Beats South Korea, Reaches Men's Olympic Soccer Final
MANCHESTER, England -- Leandro Damiao scored two second-half goals Tuesday to help Brazil beat South Korea 3-0 and reach its first Olympic men's soccer final in 24 years.
Defensive midfielder Romulo put Brazil ahead in the 38th minute and Damiao added his goals in the 57th and 64th to leave the South American team one match away from winning its first gold in soccer.
The Brazilians will face Mexico, which beat Japan 3-1 at Wembley Stadium in the other semifinal.
Brazil was the bronze-medalist in 2008 but hadn't reached the Olympic final since the 1988 Seoul Games, when it finished with the silver with a team led by Romario and Bebeto.
