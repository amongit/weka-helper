Apple Watch: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It
Apple is said to have ordered six million watches to be manufactured for the next quarter. So, what's the deal? Here are the things you can do with an Apple watch, assuming that you have $350 (or much more if you want a solid gold one.)
The first challenge is understanding how to make the various functions work, which will really be challenging since the screen is so small and there are only two tiny buttons on the side. Of course you can visit the Genius Bar at your local Apple store but the curse of grade inflation is found even here. The last two times I tried this, with a simple request for Apple cell phone and Outlook synching, either I caught them on a bad day or the availability of geniuses has declined dramatically. The Apple geniuses were modestly incompetent despite being nice people and sporting red Apple t-shirts.
The watch has 17 very small circles on it, arranged in a repeating three/four pattern on its rectangular face. One of them appears to be an actual watch face but it is really so tiny that some might have to carry a magnifying glass to tell the time. I have a magnifier app on my phone, so I could use that. Or I could just look at my phone, which tells me the time in a readable font.
What any of the rest of these circles do isn't clear; they have different colors and even smaller inner images inside of them: concentric circles, a running stick figure, a music note, an envelope, a triangle, a gear and so forth. Maybe some of these are obvious, like the running figure. But if you aren't already in the Apple fraternity, if you don't know the secret handshake, then you won't know that the colored circles within circles is the photo album.
The watch integrates with iPhone models 5 and above, but not with 4 and below, so me and my only two year old iPhone are out of luck.
That's it. There is nothing on the Apple site which spells out what all the 17 icons are for. Nor in the 12 page spread in the current Vogue. But that's really not the problem. The problem is that you cannot make, with today's best technology, a useful appliance the size of a watch, with a battery that fits inside it, which does lots of things worth doing. What are those things?
Telling time is a start. At least the watch does that, bragging that it keeps time down to plus or minus 50 milliseconds. I cannot count the number of instances when I have needed to know that it was now 1:37 and 30 seconds and 268 milliseconds.
It looks like you can make a phone call using your watch, but only so long as it is hooked up to your iPhone. But if you have your iPhone, you can already make a phone call without pushing a watch button and speaking into your wrist. Right?
Listening to music? Only via your iPhone.
Doing email? Screen's way too small. Note that on the iPhone 6 the screen is bigger, not smaller. Could there be a message here? One that's big enough to read?
There is much chatter about the two buttons on the side of the phone. The big round one does one thing, and that is magnify the screen images, like the plus/minus buttons on Google maps, which is necessary since everything is otherwise too small to read. The flat button does one thing, which is call up pictures of your friends, we assume from your contacts, but it's not clear. Then you touch one and it calls that person -- using your phone. And these two mechanical buttons are not innovations but instead steps backward. And they account for another surprising thing -- the version called Sport Watch is not waterproof. Really!?! The new Pebble watch at least claims to be water resistant.
The constraints of screen size and battery size and thus life are truly significant. And the cool things, like the Apple pay system, can certainly be done just as easily on a cell phone. That's already where we put our airline boarding passes and our coupons for 10 percent off from Home Depot anyway. Thus much of the watch's "functions" are things that the watch can facilitate, but only if you have the correct app and only if your synched phone is with you to do the heavy lifting. It's a watch with a changeable face, several things that are phone extensions, and the ability to poke you. A cute and expensive toy.
And while Apple, we'd like the watch to let us fly like Superman, be invisible, and have X-ray vision.
