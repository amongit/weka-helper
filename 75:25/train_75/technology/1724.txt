VCE launches new converged systems, sets path for future | ZDNet
VCE, in its first product announcement since EMC largely bought out Cisco as a joint venture partner, launched a series of systems that position it as a portfolio company of the storage giant.The company's new converged systems set up an architecture that aims to bring a fabric approach to the networking layer, provide a new category that offers a choice between Cisco's Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) or VMware's NSX for software defined networking and update its management software. Previously: EMC adds VCE to its stable, buys out Cisco's interestAt a high level, VCE's additions include:Of those additions, the VxBlock systems are the most notable. The addition of VxBlocks mean that VCE has two categories of converged systems. The VBlock systems are the Cisco-EMC-VMware collaboration that served the company well since inception. The VxBlocks give VCE an avenue to add technologies in the future. VCE Trey Layton, chief technology officer, said that VxBlocks are about customer choice and noted that they still continue to use Cisco technology. The general idea is that the VxBlock systems provide a layer so customers can integrate their existing technologies. "The Vscale architecture gives us an aggregation layer for SAN and LAN to aggregate multiple Vscale blocks. We can introduce other technology in the future," said Layton. VCE's goal is to assemble a data center at scale in a way that can integrate multiple systems. "Instead of buying islands of infrastructure, we're trying to tear down silos," added Layton. As for pricing, VCE doesn't disclose list pricing since each customer has various requirements.
