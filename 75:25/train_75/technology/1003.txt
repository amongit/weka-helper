Apple Pay is growing and along with that comes fraudulent activity. An analyst reports that as much as 6 percent of Apple Pay transactions are fraudulent.
The high fraud rate is not due to Apple Pay being easy to hack, rather it has to do with the account verification system used by some banks. The fraud is thought to be organized by gangs that can scale fraudulent activity quickly before being shut down.

A US Court of Appeals, in response to a request from Apple for an injunction against Samsung's handsets, was told by the judge that she doubts the infringement causes Apple irreparable harm.
Judge Kimberly Moore explained that since Apple licenses these patents "to everyone", Samsung's infringement couldn't cause irreparable harm. The appeal for an injunction followed the court ruling last year that Samsung had infringed on a number of Apple's patents.
