However, users just need to email Google to request their own invite to test out the system.The app hopes to distinguish itself from other email-organizing rivals by automatically sorting email into bundles, such as tickets or bank statements. It also offers Google Now-like card-based reminders that carry a summary of important information. The app will only work with Gmail accounts.Separately, Google today issued a reminder to developers that it's retiring the Google Apps Email Migration API v2. It has been replaced by the Gmail API that Google launched last year as its answer to the IMAP email standard."EMAPI v2 will be turned down on November 1, 2015, so you should switch to the Gmail API soon. To aid you with this effort, we've put together a developer's guide to help you migrate from EMAPI v2 to the Gmail API. Before you do that, here's your final reminder to not forget about these deprecations including EMAPI v1, which are coming even sooner (April 20, 2015)," Google Apps developer advocate Wesley Chun said.Google has provided a document to help developers migrate from the deprecated API here. The deprecation of EMAPI v1 was announced in December along with several others that are set to expire on April 20.Read more on Inbox
