The study found that India scored high in using mobile for banking transactions when compared to other countries in the world. As per the statistics, excluding voice messages, most of the mobile owners turn to their mobile phones for bill payments (78 percent), bank transactions (72 percent), and for setting up a new account (74 percent). Also, more than half of the consumers in India indulge in mobile purchases for entertainment services , games, and music downloads.
