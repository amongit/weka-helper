​Samsung hops back on Android bandwagon with printers | ZDNet
Samsung Australia has announced the availability of its first Android-powered printer range.According to Samsung, the Smart MultiXpress series will include eight multi-function device printer models, all of which have been designed to operate independently without the need for a PC app.Each printer will be powered by the Android operating system, which will mean the printers will have "great printing app scalability", the company said, similar to its smartphone technology.Todd Lynton, director of enterprise and small medium business, Samsung Electronics Australia, said the company is committed to maximising the productivity for Australian companies."Our new printer line combines advanced printing technology innovation and performance with the user-friendly Android operating system to provide businesses and IT administrators with Samsung's smart office experience," he said.The release of the Android-powered printer range follows Samsung's recent efforts to push its Tizen operating platform on the market. The open-source operating system based on Linux saw the light of day last week, when Samsung launched its first Tizen-powered smartphone, the Samsung Z1, in India. A video by Simrandeep Singh Garcha shows Tizen operating on the Samsung Z1, and demonstrates that Android apps are compatible on Tizen once an extra runtime layer is installed.Samsung also unveiled its first range of smart televisions equipped with Tizen at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2015 in Las Vegas, as it seeks to reduce its reliance on Google. Plans for a Tizen TV have been in the works since last year, when the South Korean electronics giant showed off a prototype version at the Tizen Developer Conference in San Francisco.Samsung has also rolled out Tizen-based digital cameras and smartwatches. Tizen was born after Intel and the Linux Foundation decided they were going to abandon the MeeGo platform, and is an alternative operating system to Android and Apple's iOS.
