Apple Watch: Official battery life data | ZDNet
| Image 1 of 16 Apple has finally released its newest product line – the Apple Watch. This, the company claims, it its most personal device to date. Let's take a look at what this new product has to offer.See also:The Apple Watch comes in three different varieties:Comes in two sizes:Comes in two sizes:Priced from $10K rising to a whopping $17,000 depending on the band, the Apple Watch Edition will be available from selected outlets.The aluminum used to make Apple Watch Sport is 60 percent stronger than standard alloys, while the stainless steel used to make the cases is up to 80 percent harder through a specialized cold-forging process.Apple is saying that the Apple Watch has an 18-hour battery life, which means nightly charging using the snap-on inductive charger.No word on how much real-world usage users can expect from the device.The Apple Watch will be available for pre-order and preview from April 10 in the following territories, with the product starting to ship April 24:The Apple Watch is not a standalone device, and needs an iPhone to work its magic. In fact, it offloads much of the hard work onto the iPhone in order to extend battery life.The Apple Watch will feature a highly-customizable face, allowing it to display a wide range of information.The Apple Watch puts a lot of emphasis on health and fitness, with motion trackers that monitor your movements and a heartrate monitor to keep an eye on that side of things.... all from your wrist! You can finally talk to your wristwatch!Wearers will also be able to send and receive iMessages, as well as emails and communications from other apps.The Apple watch introduces novel communications methods using sketches and even sending heartbeats.The Apple Watch leverages Siri so you can dictate messages, create appointments and much more. This means that you don't have to peck away at a microscopic keyboard!Apple has integrated the convenience of Apple Pay directly into the Apple Watch, making it even easier to use.With the Apple Watch wearers will be able to show boarding passes, hail cabs using Uber, unlock hotel doors, scroll through Instagram and much more.Some of the biggest question marks to hang over the Apple Watch have been related to battery life. Ever since Apple made it known that the device would need a daily recharge, people have been worried that the Apple Watch wouldn't be able to keep up with their day.In an attempt to answer some of the questions and alleviate concerns related to the battery, Apple has published some data. The data was collected using "preproduction Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using preproduction software."According to Apple testing, the Apple Watch has "all-day" battery life. In Apple's universe, "all-day" in this case means 18 hours (the folks in marketing are assuming that you sleep 6 hours a day). During those 18 hours an Apple Watch wearer can carry out:This, according to Apple, is a typical day.As for charge times, Apple claims the Apple Watch can be charged from 0 to 80 percent in 1.5 hours, or 0 to 100 percent in 2.5 hours.Apple has also published battery data for individual tasks:So it seems that the best case scenario is that you can get about five days out of the Apple Watch before the battery is dead (two days of using it as a watch, and a further three days of using it as a watch while it is in reserve power mode). Worst-case, you blow the battery in three hours making voice calls and then the Apple Watch transforms into just a watch. Apple Watch battery performance data is based on test results using the 38mm Apple Watch. Apple claims that the 42mm Apple Watch "typically experiences longer battery life" but offers no data as to how much longer it can go for. I'm going to assume that since Apple hasn't disclosed the difference that the battery life differences between the two sizes isn't that significant.So, it all hinges on one question: Do you work harder and longer than the battery in the Apple Watch?See also:
