Dual display YotaPhone 2 to launch in the US via Indiegogo
There's nothing better for reading ebooks like an e-ink display, which means many of us end up carrying both a smartphone and an ebook reader. YotaPhone has a solution that combines both an e-ink and 1080p full color display on one device and it's coming soon to the US.
The YotaPhone 2, check out the ZDNet full review, is available now in the UK and other countries. YotaPhone announced that US customers will soon be able to purchase a YotaPhone 2 via an upcoming Indiegogo campaign.
The Indiegogo campaign launches within the next couple of months with the phone likely to sell at an estimated price of $600. Incentives are planned for early backers so make sure to sign up on the YotaPhone site if you are interested in this unique smartphone so you can be informed as soon as the Indiegogo campaign launches.
Smartphone enthusiasts complain about lack of innovation in the smartphone market with most every manufacturer rolling out black slabs. It's interesting to see what YotaPhone is doing here with the dual display approach and I would love to test one out.
ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes posted the full specs of the YotaPhone 2 in December. It is likely that YotaPhone will have Android 5.0 Lollipop up and running on this particular US model before it starts to ship.
This update will also include more support for the e-ink display, which is essential to the success of the device as an ebook reader. At this time, you can only read DRM-free ebooks on the e-ink display. Hopefully YotaPhone can get Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, Kobo, and other ebook clients to work on the back display.
