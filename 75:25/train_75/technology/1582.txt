Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro for iPad Air 2: One of the best keyboards | ZDNet
| Image 1 of 9 When you pair a good keyboard case with the iPad Air 2, you have a working system that is very portable. It leverages the best tablet available without compromising those times when a laptop better fits the situation.The Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro impressed me when I reviewed the model for the iPad Air. The new version for the iPad Air 2 is even better due to the thinner iPad keeping things even slimmer.The case consists of a lid that houses the iPad Air 2 and a keyboard unit. The QODE protects the expensive iPad Air 2 from the bumps and scrapes of use in the field. It is not ruggedized by any means but I feel comfortable with it after heavy use.Opening the lid of the Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro exposes the keyboard on one side and the iPad Air 2 on the other. The keyboard is reminiscent of those on MacBooks, although slightly undersized due to the narrower iPad. The iPad Air 2 can be placed on either of two magnetic strips behind the keyboard for typing. This supports using the iPad in either of two viewing angles, to suit the situation. Placing the iPad on either of the strips turns on the keyboard and removing it turns it off. This eliminates the need for a power button on the case.The polycarbonate lid that forms the tray for the iPad Air 2 is only slightly bigger than the tablet. There are cutouts providing access to all iPad controls. On the back of the lid you find a big flap that provides support for the iPad Air 2 when in the typing configuration.This flap is unique as it allows detaching the tablet from the keyboard. The flap securely attaches to the lid containing the iPad to form a single unit, yet easily detaches to use the iPad Air 2 for leaving the keyboard behind. The lid goes with the iPad, forming a protective back for the tablet. Careful design by Belkin allows using a Smart Cover on the iPad with the detached back cover in place.The ability to detach the iPad and the unique flap makes it possible to use the Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro with the tablet in portrait orientation. It is secured adequately by the flap to make it stable with the iPad standing tall.The aluminum keyboard with black chiclet keys on the Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro is a good one, with a key layout like those on MacBooks. This makes moving back and forth between this keyboard and a laptop a natural process. There is no adjusting the typing method as there would be with differing layouts.Touch typists will find that with decent spacing between keys and good tactile feedback, it is possible to type fast. I find I make few typos when typing rapidly, just like on a laptop. Backlighting means you can do that in the dark. Of course, heavy use of the backlighting will shorten the estimated one year battery life of the keyboard.SummaryThe Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro is one of the most versatile keyboard cases for the iPad Air 2. It is a nice case that supports working with the tablet as a slate and also like a laptop. The ability to flip the iPad into portrait orientation while typing on the keyboard is an appreciated feature.Pros:Cons:Reviewer’s rating: 9 out of 10The Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro is available at Amazon for $149.99.ZDNet reviews of top keyboard cases for the iPad Air:(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)When you pair a good keyboard case with the iPad Air 2, you have a working system that is very portable.
