​IP Australia to trial IBM's Watson | ZDNet
IP Australia has teamed up with IBM to trial its cognitive computing technology Watson.IBM, Apple forge enterprise app pact: Watson, meet iPadShe said IP Australia will develop a working user scenario to demonstrate how the tool can benefit the company's working environment in the future.Kelly said some of the potential use cases of where Watson would be applied include smart decision support tools for staff to support work processes; increasing the speed in which IP Australia responds to customers; and providing interactive Q&A services to help customers navigate through the IP system."It is exciting for IP Australia to explore these opportunities to improve how we deliver efficient, timely, and high-quality services to the public. By exploring new opportunities, we can lead the global IP economy in a revolutionary digital transformation to develop a world-leading IP system that builds prosperity for Australians," she said.IP Australia's trial with IBM will commence in March and be completed in June.Watson works by consuming vast amounts of information to provide insights to people by answering questions. Watson learns from its interactions with people, creating a profile of the user based on stated, observed, and inferred preferences and experiences.Already in use in the medical research, finance and banking, international education, and travel and hospitality sectors, IBM's Watson can analyse a range of disparate data and provide responses with intelligent reason.
