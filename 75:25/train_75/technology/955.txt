VMware moves to post-PC world with mobile tools
VMware has given further details on its upcoming VMware View 5.1 mobile device management software.
View 5.1 will get new security features, such as two-factor authentication, along with support for integration with virtualised storage arrays to improve provisioning speeds, VMware announced on Thursday.

VMware is emphasising its mobile technologies because it foresees "the end of the personal desktop as the only way to use compute and automation", Boaz Chalamish, general manager of end-user computing for VMware, told ZDNet UK. "The end user is demanding the same experience they have in their personal life when they come to work."
The updates reflect a strategic shift at VMware, which seeks to get away from the virtualisation layer and help companies manage devices, clouds and even their storage infrastructure.
"We're optimising our solutions to work over VMware," Chalamish said, before pointing out that VMware is keen to support hypervisors other than its own ESX, and does not want customers to feel locked in. "We are leveraging our strengths but not forcing all components of the VMware stack," he added.
VMware View 5.1 will go on sale in the next three months, the company said, without giving a specific date.
