Facebook stocks up on e-commerce with TheFind acquisition
Facebook's warpath toward all-around social conglomerate continues with the acquisition of TheFind.
Founded in 2006, the Mountain View, Calif.-based startup built an e-commerce platform focused on retail search and discovery, typically for more fashion-forward Internet users.
Some of TheFind's social shopping competitors include PopSugar Network-owned ShopStyle, Fancy.com, and increasingly Pinterest as the latter grows out its own direct e-commerce channels.
TheFind also has also heavily pushed a mobile-first strategy over the last few years, ramping up connections with shoppers on its smartphone and tablet apps.
Given Facebook's increased revenue (and reliance) on mobile based on its last several earnings reports, the ethos at TheFind significantly mirrors its new parent company.
TheFind team confirmed the merger in a blog post on Friday. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
However, it's not clear if the entire employee base at TheFind will be moving over to the world's largest social network.
The company memo only specified "key members of our team are joining the company."
The team members who do make it over to the Menlo Park headquarters will be working in Facebook advertising's department, tasked with improving the display of relevant and contextual ads.
Compared to some of Facebook's previous (and multi-billion dollar) acquisitions of Whatsapp and Instagram, the TheFind purchase reflects a much more niche motivation rather than a grab for more users.
TheFind as a standalone search engine will be shutting down over the next few weeks.
