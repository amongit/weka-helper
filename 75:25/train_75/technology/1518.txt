â€‹IBM, Softbank partner on cognitive computing: Watson, meet Pepper | ZDNet
IBM and Softbank have teamed up to bring the Watson cognitive computing platform to Japan, teach Japanese and integrate it with Pepper, the social robot.The collaboration, which was outlined Tuesday, is an interesting inflection point for Watson. IBM is looking to broaden adoption and Japan, the third largest economy behind China and the U.S., represents Watson's first foray into a language that isn't based on the Western alphabet. Under the partnership, IBM and Softbank will attempt to teach Watson to speak and think in Japanese, a language that is tricky to learn because of its kanji alphabet, which is a series of complex diagrams. Should the IBM-Softbank partnership be successful, Watson could inform the actions of Pepper, which is a social robotics platform that aims to be a helper to the Japanese population.Softbank has billed Pepper as a companion that's engaging, friendly and emotionally intelligent. Watson will give Pepper a larger knowledge base to work with and could make the robot more applicable to specific industries.
