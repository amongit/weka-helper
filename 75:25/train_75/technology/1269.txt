Mobile apps galore for managing business cards
(This piece was updated July 28, 2014, to update the status of CardMunch and several other services, and to add several new resources. As before, this list is in alphabetical order.)
You never know when you'll wind up asking someone for a paper business card but when was the last time you actually consulted a Rolodex to find someone's phone number, address or emaill address?
Personally speaking, my ever-growing electronic contact database now spans my Google Apps account, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and anything I have added on my own after a conference or tradeshow experience. I actually treasure those physical cards because I love paper: there's a small-ish pile of them in my top desk drawer.
The nature of card-collecting habits makes managing them an inherently mobile task, one that relies on either manual entry or a smartphone camera or even a miniature scanner to turn the information digital. With that in mind, here's the latest about mobile apps and services designed to make this process a little simpler. The most important thing to know is that CardMunch (which LinkedIn bought back in 2011) is now officially end-of-life, but as you can see, there are plenty of options.
