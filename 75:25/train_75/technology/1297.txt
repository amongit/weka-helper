Zero Day Weekly: Facebook Reconnect hijack, Rowhammer, CISA quietly approved

Welcome to Zero Day's Week In Security, our roundup of notable security news items for the week ending March 13, 2015. Covers enterprise, controversies, reports and more.
Facebook declined to fix it: The "Reconnect" tool allows attackers to generate URLs to hijack accounts on sites using Facebook Login. Reconnect was released last week by San Francisco based pentester Egor Homakov. It takes advantage of a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) issue in Facebook Login, the service that allows users to log in on websites using their Facebook accounts. The Reconnect proof-of-concept tool generates malicious URLs to hijack accounts on Bit.ly, About.me, Stumbleupon, Angel.co, Mashable and Vimeo (Booking.com has since closed the hole). The vuln was disclosed in January 2014 after Facebook declined to fix it; Facebook this week denied that it's refusing to fix the attack, pushing the blame to developers who don't follow Facebook's best practices. However, other sites using Facebook Login can be targeted by manually inputting links that trigger Facebook login requests on behalf of their users into the tool.
