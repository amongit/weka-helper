LaCie unveils USB-C external drive for the new MacBook | ZDNet
LaCie, the premium brand of Seagate Technology, announced the addition of USB-C technology to its Porsche Design Mobile Drive, making it the perfect match for Apple's new MacBook.Before they were stars: Smartwatches in pop cultureFrom the stone ages of the Flintstones to the futuristic sky cities of the Jetsons, the smartwatch has been a surprising yet underlying constant in pop culture.The new MacBook comes with a single port - a USB-C port - that handles power and connectivity. You can add USB ports, but that will cost you more than an Apple TV, so getting a device that can plug directly into the port will save both on cabling and money. The LaCie Mobile Drive delivers data transfer rates up to 100 MB/s, and features an enclosure made from 3 mm thick solid aluminum that not only protects the drive but also helps dissipate heat. While the LaCie Mobile Drive was designed with users of the new MacBook in mind, it is compatible with standard USB 3.0 (Type-A) or USB 2.0 ports thanks to the included adapter cable, so everyone can use it (Mac and Windows).The new LaCie Mobile Drive will be available next quarter in 500 GB (slim size), 1 TB, and 2 TB capacities.See also:
