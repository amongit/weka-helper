Obama's Arctic Plan Riles Republicans
President Barack Obama has found another way to infuriate his Republican opponents in Congress. This time, it's his plan to declare 12 million acres of public land in Alaska off limits to development, including oil and gas production.
Environmentalists and some liberal-oriented organizations such as the Center for American Progress hailed the decision, but it prompted a furious response from Alaska legislators led by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Republican chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She said Monday that the Obama administration "had effectively declared war on Alaska" and would damage the state's oil-dependent economy. She added in a statement: "It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory ... I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska. But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal."

Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said, "It's just one more example of President Obama thumbing his nose at the citizens of a sovereign state â€“ and will put Alaska and America's energy security in serious jeopardy."
The Alaska officials are intent on blocking any legislation that would make the acreage permanently off limits to development by declaring it as wilderness, which Obama is proposing. And Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said he might accelerate state leasing of the land in question for oil exploration before the administration in Washington has time to clamp down.
White House counselor John Podesta told reporters that the anger of Murkowski, as the lead legislator on the issue, was not "warranted." He said that while the Interior Department will take unilateral steps to protect the 12 million acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until the fate of the legislation is decided, the administration will not necessarily ask Congress to ban all drilling on the tract.
But there's a broader pattern in the administration's actions. Obama has been assiduously cultivating his base, which includes environmentalists, by taking unilateral action or pushing other initiatives that his supporters are clamoring for.

At the same time, he is confronting conservative opponents as he bypasses Congress as much as he can, even though Obama's Democratic party lost its majority in the Senate and lost seats in the GOP-controlled House in last November's midterm elections.
Obama has already begun moving to unilaterally limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, which alienated legislators of both major parties in coal-dependent and coal-producing states such as West Virginia and Kentucky.
Obama is also fighting Republicans over their legislation to authorize the Keystone oil pipeline, which Obama opposes at this time, and over other issues such as immigration. It all adds up to more confrontation in Washington for the foreseeable future.
