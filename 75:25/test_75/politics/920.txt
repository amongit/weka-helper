Panetta Right About Obama
Leon Panetta's incisive critique of President Barack Obama--which is being widely discussed in Washington--is important for two reasons: It comes from one of the most respected public servants to work in government during the past four decades, and it confirms the doubts that many who know Obama have voiced privately about his flawed judgment and stubborn insistence on doing things his way.
I've known and respected Panetta for 20 years. And like so many others, I find Panetta's resume to be sterling and his reputation for fairness and decency unassailable. He is the son of Italian immigrants, worked in Richard Nixon's White House for a while, then switched to the Democratic party and served as a U.S. representative from California. He chaired the House Budget Committee, became Bill Clinton's budget director and was named Clinton's chief of staff. He took a break from government during George W. Bush's administration but returned to become President Obama's CIA director and then defense secretary.

Panetta's new book, "Worthy Fights," is causing a stir in Washington and getting serious attention, and for good reason. He writes that Obama "avoids the battle, complains, and misses opportunities." Panetta told USA Today this week that Obama has "lost his way" in some cases, such as not seeing the threat from Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria early enough, and exhibiting "the logic of a law professor rather than the passion of a leader."
Panetta confirms a subtext about Obama that has been discussed in Washington for years--that he loves to consider the nuances of policy but sometimes resents the more tedious and, to him, negative side of governing, such as dealing with people he doesn't like and compromising with his adversaries. Instead, Panetta finds that too often Obama is insular and too stubborn.
Panetta told Fox News Tuesday night that Obama made a serious mistake by failing to insist that the United States keep a troop presence in Iraq after the end of the full-fledged U.S. occupation there in 2011. He concedes that the Baghdad government at the time opposed such a residual force but Panetta says Obama could have gotten Baghdad to agree if he had pressed harder.
Perhaps Panetta's most important point is that Obama has not projected an image of strength around the world and has sent "mixed messages" about whether he will keep his commitments. It's a serious critique, and one that the president should take to heart.
