Poll Finds Latino Boost for Obama
President Barack Obama got what he was hoping for when he announced a new policy to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation: a surge in support from Latinos, many of whom stand to benefit from the new initiative.
The latest Gallup poll finds that Obama's approval rating among Hispanics increased by 14 points, to 68 percent, during the past two weeks. During that time, Obama announced he was taking executive action on immigration and bypassing Congress, where Republicans have blocked his proposals.

The poll indicates that Latino support for Obama is now 25 points higher than the national average of 43 percent approval among all voters, and 37 points higher than his approval among non-Hispanic whites, which stands at 31 percent. Obama has even lower ratings among white non-college graduates, only 27 per cent of whom approve of his job performance.
Obama has clearly been a divisive figure. "Whites in general constitute a political challenge for Democrats and the president, given their Republican orientation," says a spokesman for Gallup.
