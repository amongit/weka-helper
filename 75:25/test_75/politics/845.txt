Obama Faces Difficult Decision on Ukraine
President Barack Obama is facing one of the most important decisions of his administration as he assesses whether to send military aid to Ukrainian forces that are battling pro-Russian separatists in a bloody and escalating conflict.
Obama is reluctant to send the military aid but many Republicans in Congress are pressuring him to approve it.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel opposes the aid and she will be meeting with Obama Monday to make her case.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, there is a strong hawkish faction among the potential Republican presidential candidates for 2016, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is considering entering the race as an advocate of a more muscular U.S. foreign policy.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is also arguing for military aid to Ukraine as a way to limit Russian President Vladimir Putin's expansionist tendencies. "I can assure you that he will not stop until he has to pay a much higher price" than the one being exacted by the current U.S. economic sanctions against Moscow, McCain said.
But Secretary of State John Kerry argued Sunday that the administration has little or no interest in providing military aid to Ukrainian forces at this time. "There is no military solution," Kerry told NBC News. "The solution is a political, diplomatic one."

There are signs that the diplomatic efforts now under way are also reaching a pivotal phase. Representatives of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine are planning to meet this week to discuss a peaceful resolution of the conflict. One problem is that past agreements have broken down.
Putin sees the Ukraine war as a way to restore some of Russia's great power status from the past.

One fear is that if Ukraine falls apart and pro-Russian influence grows there, Putin will be emboldened. This could mean Russia challenges the West more frequently in other areas, possibly in Lithuania or Estonia. A challenge there could trigger a response from the United States and other NATO allies that might lead to a resumption of the Cold War or worse.
Political scientist John J. Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago wrote in The New York Times Sunday in opposition to the United States arming Ukraine: "Because the balance of power decisively favors Moscow, Washington would have to send large amounts of equipment for Ukraine's army to have a fighting chance. But the conflict will not end there. Russia would counter-escalate, taking away any temporary benefit Kiev might get from American arms."
