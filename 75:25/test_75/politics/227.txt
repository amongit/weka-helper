Texas and Florida voters could one day see a familiar name on the ballot: Sean Hannity of Fox News says he'd be open to becoming a candidate for elected office.
"The answer is yes, I'd think about it," Hannity said this week in response to a question posed on Facebook. "It would be either Texas or Florida."
Hannity, a favorite of conservatives, didn't specify what office he'd seek. But during an "Ask Sean" segment on Fox News, in which he answers Facebook and Twitter questions, Hannity said he's unhappy with both the Democratic and Republican parties.
He called Democrats a "socialist party" and criticized Republicans for being "timid" and "anti-Obama" without offering a "positive, solution-oriented agenda."
Hannity caused a stir on his radio program this week when he said he's going to get out of New York when he can because of his tax burden. There is no state income tax in Texas or Florida.
"As soon as I am able, some time probably when my son graduates from high school, I'm getting out of here as quick as I can," Hannity told his Fox News colleague, Greta Van Susteren, on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Dallas Morning News reports Hannity has accepted an invitation from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, to attend President Obama's State of the Union Address on Tuesday night.
