Turning the Red Carpet Green
It takes a mad man to go green to the Emmys. But somebody’s got to lead a vanguard of bicyclists clad in black ties right up to the red carpet, to mix into the parade of limos and beautiful people in expensive gowns and suits, right? What better place to say bicycling is the old new thing?
That somebody is Emmy nominee Tom Smuts, a writer and producer for "Mad Men," the hit show about the 1960s up for best drama. “Who am I? Just a scrivener,” he says to me. Tom is my brother-in-law; he went from working as a lawyer to a screenwriter and knows a ton. The 48-year-old also knows the power of a good idea and quickly rounded up riders to create a cause, surrounded by buzz. The caper made the front page of the Los Angeles Times and gained the nod of the Television Academy.
One of the 15 riders will be his identical twin brother, Peter Smuts. His wife, Meredith Stiehm, will ride in a gown for the last leg. Meredith is an executive producer on "Homeland," for which she won an Emmy. She will ride as “a symbolic supporter,” Tom says.

The son of Pittsburgh city planner Edward Smuts, Tom told me the 17-mile bike ride to the festive awards is a statement for making the city more connected, livable, breathable and fair for all on its roads and sidewalks. “It’s pleasant to think of streets as more than passageways for cars,” he says. Growing up, he saw how his father took old railroad tracks and helped convert them into busways. Los Angeles, with its vast monuments of asphalt infrastructure, took the automobile age to the end of the road.
A serious rider who commutes to work by bike three days a week, Tom says the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition is part of the burgeoning bicycle movement now sweeping New York, Washington and even as far as London, where Mayor Boris Johnson rides everywhere. Environmentally forward Madison, Wisconsin, made its roads and paths bike-friendly years ago.
So the city built on ozone won’t be a slave to the car or the SUV or the limo no more. At least not today. In show business style, Emmy-goers will see a simple but grand way to say yes to greening the city of freeways, and the beauty of two wheels.

The way Tom rides, hyper-vigilant with helmet, darting in and out of traffic lanes, he can cross the city to work (even downtown) in about the same time as it takes to drive. Traffic is always getting worse, but there is hope in sight: A mass transit system is underway at last.
The ride to the Emmys this afternoon will start from Tom and Meredith’s vintage house in Santa Monica. He’ll wear a sporty, dressy ensemble with a smart collar, designed to double as cycling clothes.
Earlier, Tom first planned to ride alone. “I’m going to ride my bike to the Emmys.” he posted on social media. Maybe Meredith would give him a lift home in her car. Word of mouth gathered speed in a week or two. In a sign of a city ready to try new things, Mayor Eric Garcetti quickly endorsed the Emmy ride plan.

“I hope to change attitudes and awareness and acceptance more than anything,” Tom says of his goals. “We’d like to civilize the relationship between cyclists and drivers.”
The ride from Santa Monica to the Nokia isn’t for the faint of heart. It crosses miles of busy traffic on some of Los Angeles’ most travelled roads, including Wilshire and Pico Boulevards. The Emmys ceremony is almost always on Sunday, when the streets are clear, but NBC set the date on Monday because of its Sunday Night Football franchise.
The glamorous Emmys go green. Good luck Tom, hope you bring one home.
