Obama and Congress Just Aren't Into Each Other
President Obama hit all the right notes, especially on economic fairness, employment and unemployment, at his annual recital before Congress.
"Give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance," he exhorted them in so many ways. We need everyone on the field, America.
[Check out our editorial cartoons on President Obama.]
Ain't it right, all of it, the need for new skills for the new economy? And of course we need to reach more kids with early education.
Obama was stern when it came to slapping down another government shutdown. The salute to a terribly wounded Army sergeant, hurt in Afghanistan, was a huge heartwarmer.

But you know what? The president and Congress are just not into each other. A winning speech is not going to change a very cold climate.
