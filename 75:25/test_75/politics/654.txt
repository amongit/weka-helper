Planet of the '-Gates': From Richard Nixon to Belichick and Brady - US News
The New England Patriots find themselves the subject of another NFL investigation after officials found 11 of the team’s 12 game balls were deflated beyond league regulations during the Patriots' 45-7 blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the Jan. 18 AFC title game.
The scandal has been dubbed “Deflategate” in the latest reference to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation from office.
"I didn't alter the balls in any way," Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said during a press conference Thursday. "I was as surprised as anybody when I heard Monday morning what was happening."

Patriots' coach Bill Belichick said earlier Thursday he was "shocked" to learn of the deflation accusations, according to ESPN.
Each team's offense is supplied its own footballs, which are checked by officials before kickoff. League rules stipulate footballs must be inflated to a minimum of 12.5 pounds per square inch. The NFL reportedly found only one of the Patriots' 12 game balls met such a standard.
This is not Belichick’s first "-gate." In 2007, New England was accused of illegally filming defensive signals called from the New York Jets’ sideline during a game New England won 38-14.

Belichick eventually was fined an NFL-maximum $500,000, and his team was fined an additional $250,000 and lost a 2008 first-round draft pick.
As the NFL looks into whether the team’s claims of "Deflategate" ignorance are legitimate – or full of hot air – U.S. News takes a look back at some of history’s most notable "-gates."
From the Watergate scandal to Tiger Woods’ affairs ("Tigergate") and former-Rep. Anthony Weiner’s illicit pictures ("Weinergate"), check out some of the last several decades’ most significant "-gates."
