Treatment for Concussions in Young People on the Rise
Kids and teens have increasingly been getting the care they need for concussions in recent years – even in states where the law hasn't always required it, a new report shows. The findings appear to bolster the case that both laws and public awareness can drastically influence whether people seek health care.

The first concussion-related law that brought more attention to the issue passed in 2009 in Washington state. By 2014, all states and the District of Columbia had passed similar laws, which outlined medical care for teens and kids. The laws vary slightly by state, but most relate to the education of coaches or students, the immediate removal of an athlete from a game or the required clearance of a medical professional before an athlete can return to a sport.
Treatment sought out by families – and evaluated in the report – included visits to an emergency department or to neurologists. Some patients were admitted to a hospital or received a CT scan.
The latest findings, published online Monday by JAMA Pediatrics, found that from 2008 to 2012, states with concussion laws saw a 92 percent increase in treatment for children and teens. But the treatment rates also increased in places that had not yet passed laws by that time – there was a 75 percent rise in care even in those states. The authors hypothesized that this was due to increased media attention about concussions, and found that stories about the topic increased sixfold during the same period.

"There are two stories here," Steven Broglio, the study's senior author and an associate professor in the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology, said in a statement. "First, the legislation works. The other story is that broad awareness of an injury has an equally important effect. We found large increases in states without legislation, showing that just general knowledge plays a huge part."
The study showed that after the first concussion law passed in 2009, treatment rates in states without concussion laws increased about 20 percent each year. In states with concussion laws, the annual rates of treated concussions increased on average by an additional 13 percent.
By 2012, in states without laws, doctor visits for concussions rose 78 percent compared to pre-legislation trends. The rate of doctor visits was 17 percent higher in states with concussion laws than in states without them.
Rates of treated concussions in states that hadn't passed laws were 7 percent higher in 2009-2010, 20 percent higher in 2010-2011 and 34 percent higher in 2011-2012.
"My thought was that all types of concussion-related services might increase in states that enacted the legislation," Teresa Gibson, a study author who was vice president of health outcomes for Truven Health Analytics when the research was conducted, said in a statement. "The fact that we didn't see inpatient visits and emergency department visits increase in states with the legislation, but we saw office-based procedures go up, suggests that the legislation is having the intended effect on these injuries."

To compile the report, researchers examined U.S. insurance data from privately insured 12- to 18-year-olds.
It's estimated that between 1.6 and 3.8 million concussions occur in the U.S. each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, but neurologists believe more than about half go unreported, so they are not sure of the precise number. A concussion is a common type of temporary injury to the brain that often can occur during sports or other recreational activities. Typically it leads to nausea, ringing in the ears, dizziness or fatigue, but when more serious can lead to seizures, numbness, slurred speech, confusion, or trouble walking or sleeping.
If treated properly, most who are injured from concussions can resume normal activity within 14 days, though long-term effects aren't known. Doctors typically prescribe both mental and physical rest after a concussion, as well as a mild pain reliever for headaches.
For teen athletes, there can be a risk for second-impact syndrome, which is when a teen is hit in the head a second time before the first concussion has healed. Such an incident can result in significant brain damage.
