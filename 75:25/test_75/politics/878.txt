Obama Off to Hawaii, Drawing Criticism
President Barack Obama is scheduled to leave Washington for Hawaii Friday to spend his annual Christmas vacation in the islands where he grew up. Criticism is sure to follow.
Presidents, regardless of party, tend to get pilloried for taking too much time off during their holidays. The political opposition has a tradition of saying the commander in chief goofs off when he leaves Washington because there is always important public business to be done. White House aides respond by saying a president can't escape his duties no matter where he is. They argue that he still receives official briefings and makes decisions, especially if a crisis occurs, so the commander in chief is never completely off the job.

Another line of criticism is that the president spends too much taxpayer money getting away. This is where Obama is particularly vulnerable. The cost of flying Air Force One to Honolulu – the most distant site ever used for a regular presidential vacation – amounts to $228,288 per hour, according to Judicial Watch, a government watchdog group. Obama's family trip to Hawaii last year cost $4.1 million for the round-trip flights alone, the group said. That didn't include other costs such as for security, communication and staff.

Obama's defenders say he has a legitimate reason to return to Hawaii each year because it's where he was born, where he grew up as a teen, and where he still has many friends who help him to unwind. This will be his seventh consecutive Christmas vacation in Hawaii, and he plans to spend 17 days there, White House officials said.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that Obama is "eagerly looking forward" to his family holiday. He usually spends his time playing golf, going to the beach with his wife and two daughters, snorkeling, dining in local restaurants, and relaxing with friends. In the past, he has rented a private home in Kailua at his own expense but White House officials have not released the details of his accommodations.

Past presidents who have been criticized for going on vacation too often include George W. Bush, who regularly visited his Texas ranch; George H.W. Bush, who made frequent trips to his seaside estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, and Lyndon Johnson, who often went to his ranch in Texas. As I explain in my book, "From Mount Vernon to Crawford: A History of the Presidents and Their Retreats," presidential vacations are easy targets, but the criticism rarely causes presidents not to go on holiday because they need the break.
