Climate Change This Week: Siberia Holes Up, Solar Over Oil, and More!
Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.

@@ You Can Believe the Senator With a Snowball OR ... After Senator James Inhofe tossed a snowball in the Senate to illustrate his ignorance of the link between extreme weather (both hot AND cold) and climate change, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse rode to the rescue of sanity on the subject.

YOU CAN ACT... after you've dissolved into hysterical giggles at the absurdity of Senator Inhofe - and lob a snowball back at him!
Sign here and Environmental Action will deliver dozens of snowballs to Sen Inhofe's office (yes, they're serious), and they'll inscribe each one with a personal message from climate activists like you to the Pro-tem of climate denial.
Signing that made my day...

The coast in Qingdao in Shandong province, China, during an upcoming rainstorm. Sea levels along the coast are rising faster than the world average due to climate change, recent China media reported.
But take another look at that picture.
The seemingly ordinary family in the foreground must be quite rich, for China levies significant fees beyond having more than one child. As China loosens its one child policy and the increasing, prosperous middle class explodes as energy consumers, so, too, will climate changing emissions and humanity's future explode, unless there is a dramatic switch to clean energy - and we ALL adopt a one child policy.

Overpopulation and Climate Change Helped Spark Syria Uprising in conjunction with poor leadership, says a new study, reports the Business Standard. Five recent years of drought, intensified by climate change, slashed food production by a third as the population exploded from 4 to 22 million over the past half century. Poor, corrupt leadership added fuel to the fire.
"Rapid demographic change encourages instability" say the authors. Over a million hungry refugees added to the Iraqi war refugees already flooding city peripheries, and were ignored by government., as food prices and malunutrition soared.

Daily Climate Change: Global Map of Unusual Temperatures, Mar 8, 2015
How unusual has the weather been? No one event is "caused" by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.
Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, much of the US and the waters surrounding it are experiencing warmer than normal temperatures: the eastern Pacific warm spot continues to prevent much rain from reaching California, sending it into further drought.
Much of the areas surrounding the North Pole are experiencing much warmer than normal temperatures - not good news for our Arctic thermal shield of ice. Hotter than usual temperatures continue to dominate human habitats.
Natural Repercussions:
OO A February First: Planetary CO2 Levels Pass 400 PPM Milestone - while many experts have said that 350 ppm and above allows the development of dangerous climate change.

A Historical First: 2 Consecutve Record -Warm Winters in California are caused by a stable high pressure ridge just off the California coast reports Andrea Thompson at Climate Central. The ridge, in turn, is likely fueled by the extremely warm Pacific waters beneath it, says a NOAA climatologist.
Since ocean temperatures change very slowly, though, don't expect the ridge - or hot dry weather - to end anytime soon. Meanwhile, the state's water storage system, the snowpack, is at near-record low levels. The drought continues...

Every day is Earth Day, folks, as I was reminded by this peach blossom I photographed one spring. Making the U.S. a global clean energy leader will ensure a heck of a lot more jobs, and a clean, safe future. If you'd like to join the increasing numbers of people who want to TELL Congress that they will vote for clean energy candidates you can do so here. It's our way of letting Congress know there's a strong clean energy voting bloc out there. For more detailed summaries of the above and other climate change items, audio podcasts and texts are freely available.
