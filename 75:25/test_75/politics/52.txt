Jeb Bush knocks Scott Walker’s presumed ‘frontrunner’ status
Bush is back in New Hampshire. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton HUDSON, N.H. -- Frontrunner? What frontrunner? That was Jeb Bush's message to reporters who tried asking him on Friday about Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Like Bush, Walker is sitting atop early presidential primary in this state and among Republicans nationally. And, like Bush, Walker was launching his first New Hampshire trip in years on Friday. A reporter pressed Bush on whether he agreed with Walker, who said this week that maybe he's "the frontrunner" because President Obama decided to weigh in this week on Wisconsin leader's decision to sign right-to-work legislation. "I'm not a candidate, maybe he is, I don't know," Bush said in response. "You can't be a frontrunner until you start running." [] He also declined to evaluate his standing in the race, saying "I don't evaluate it. I'm joyfully pursuing the possibility of this and I will do so at some point and then I'll go at it." During a brief Q&A with reporters, Bush was also asked whether he would co-sign a letter sent this week by Republican senators to Iranian leaders. Bush said he wouldn't but that he understands why they wrote it. "I’m not a senator. I think they signed it out of frustration that there’s been no dialogue, no conversation, there’s been a stifling of debate about the properness of this negotiation," he said. Controversy erupted this week when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter co-signed by 46 other GOP senators to senior Iranian leaders, warning them that a future president might revoke whatever agreement the Obama administration strikes in the coming weeks. Two other potential presidential candidates -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- have asked to be included as co-signers, while Bush and others have expressed support. Bush said he supports a measure introduced by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) that would require congressional approval of any agreement reached between the President Obama, Iranian leaders and other world powers. The bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. When Bush was pressed on whether he supported the legislative branch interfering in foreign affairs, he pointed to precedent. "It did happen on my brother’s watch," he said. "Nancy Pelosi went to Syria at a time when Hezbollah and Syria had major influence in Lebanon and there was a very sensitive time to try to kick them out of the country and allow Lebanon to be freer. So it happens, historically." Bush was picking up on an argument made by Republicans this week, who noted that Pelosi traveled to Syria to meet with Bashar al-Assad in April 2007. While there, she discussed the Iraq war and potential peace talks between Syria and Israel. But her office defended the visit this week, saying that Republicans were wrongly trying to equate her visit with their letter-writing campaign. "The desperate hyperventilation by Republicans and conservative talkers over the intense, national backlash to this letter has caused them to search for a Democratic equivalent to the dangerous precedent set by 47 Republican Senators," Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement on Wednesday. "The fact is, there is simply not one." Bush, making his first trip to this key early-voting state in 15 years, came to this small town about 30 minutes south of Manchester on Friday afternoon to meet with about 30 local academic, civic and business leaders at Integra Biosciences Corp. The company manufactures medical laboratory equipment and employs 80 people in New Hampshire, and another 80 in Europe. Amazingly, Bush's team found a manufacturing firm in New Hampshire that’s never hosted a presidential candidate before. He was trailed by nearly three dozen reporters and photographers who snaked their way along narrow hallways as Bush toured a "clean room," where workers were building equipment. He was given a brief demonstration of the company's tools by an employee who said he had immigrated to the United States from Mexico. When the man told Bush that he's from Tijuana, the former governor told him in Spanish that his wife, Columba, is from the Mexican city of Leon. "Oh, de Guanajato," the man said in reply, a reference to the Mexican state where Leon is located. Bush is slated to attend a "political house party" Friday night in Dover and attend several closed-door events Saturday, including a fundraiser for Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) before heading home to Miami.
