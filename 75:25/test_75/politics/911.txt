Hillary Clinton on the Campaign Trail
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is doing everything possible to pave the way for a presidential run in 2016 short of actually announcing her candidacy, and fellow Democrats mostly like what they see.
When Clinton started doing more campaign-like events earlier this year, she seemed rusty and off her game. Now she is showing considerable skill on the stump, and she is putting it to good use in urging support for Democratic candidates across the country. She made an enthusiastic pitch for women's votes in Colorado this week, arguing that Democrats are pushing for pay equality and making other efforts to help women while Republicans are blocking such moves. And she said Democrats have Middle America's interests at heart. "We need votes for people who believe in you, who worry about you and do everything in their power to give you and your families opportunities," she told a Democratic crowd in Aurora, Colorado.

A senior Democratic strategist who has advised his party's congressional candidates for decades says Clinton is easing concerns that she is too much a part of the past. "She is defining herself as a contemporary figure," he said. "At this point, I'm sure more people feel they would be going forward with Hillary than backward with Hillary." And she is proving that she is not solely an adjunct of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, the strategist said, adding: "She is showing that she is her own person."
Republicans, however, see her as too liberal and burdened with heavy baggage, partly from her husband's presidency when she stood by him during the Monica Lewinsky sex-and-lies scandal. She also has baggage from Barack Obama's presidency, during which she was secretary of state. GOP strategists say she has been tarnished by what they consider Obama's weak foreign policy.
Clinton will travel back to Iowa on Oct. 29, according to CNN, for her second visit in about a month. She is expected to campaign again for Iowa Democrats including Bruce Braley, the party's nominee for the Senate who is in a close race with Republican nominee Joni Ernst.
But there are other implications to her visit. Iowa will be the first state to hold presidential nominating caucuses in 2016, so Clinton's every step in the state is closely scrutinized to assess her appeal and whether she actually intends to run for the White House. She leads in the polls for the Democratic nomination but says she hasn't decided whether to run.

Democrats of all stripes seem eager for her to enter the race. Liberals remain suspicious of her views on national security and they consider her too hawkish about using American power abroad. But many liberals have been reluctant to criticize Clinton because they believe she has a good chance to maintain the Democratic party's control of the White House and they don't want to undermine her. Also, many liberals don't see realistic alternatives to Hillary Clinton at this time. Centrist Democrats like her because they think she would not be a left-wing zealot and would push a Democratic agenda in Congress more effectively and pragmatically than President Obama.

Clinton has traveled extensively on behalf of Democratic candidates this year, unlike Obama who has not been invited to appear with some major Democratic candidates in conservative states (even though he has been featured at many private fundraisers for his party across the country). In the past several weeks, Clinton has traveled to California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Democratic operatives who are close to Clinton say she will be actively campaigning right through the midterm election on Nov. 4.
Clinton, the former first lady and senator from New York ran for president in 2008 and lost the nomination to Obama. Early in that campaign cycle, she was the prohibitive favorite among Democrats, as she is now, but her campaign fizzled. So there is always the chance for an upset. But for now, Hillary Clinton is soaring, and she appears to be enjoying the ride.
