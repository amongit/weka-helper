Who Is Right on the Economy?
In an interview with Vox released Monday, Obama said these gains should be the basis for an aggressive federal effort to close the widening gap between rich and poor Americans.

“Our job now is to create additional tools that, number one, make sure that everybody’s got a baseline of support to be able to succeed in a constantly moving economy,” he argued.
Obama added that his goals include providing health care “that survives job loss,” access to child care and a higher minimum wage. He called for higher taxes on the rich and big corporations, using the revenue to help middle-class people in various ways, and launching a huge program to build roads and improve power grids. Among his other proposals are paid family leave, additional preschool, an expanded earned income tax credit and child tax credit, free community college and paying more to teachers.

Bolstering Obama’s argument about ongoing economic progress, on Feb. 6, the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 257,000 last month and the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent because more people were looking for jobs. Labor Department analysts said this was a good sign because it indicated rising worker confidence in the economy.
But there is another side of the story. Many believe Obama is hyping the condition of the economy in order to make himself look good and that he is wrong on key parts of his analysis. They say it is premature to trumpet the gains made and to forge ahead with massive federal programs.
Jim Clifton, chairman and CEO of the Gallup polling organization, recently wrote in a blog post the unemployment rate described by the White House, Wall Street and the media is a “big lie.” Clifton said the number of full-time jobs in the United States as a percentage of the adult population “is the worst it’s been in 30 years.”
make this case to the country. His problem is he lacks the money to conduct a credible campaign so he probably will not be an effective spokesman for this kind of populism.

Overall, what appears to be happening is that while the overall economy is benefiting many – especially Wall Street and the wealthy – millions of Americans are not feeling the positive effects. The latest Associated Press/GfK poll finds that nearly half of Americans say the national economy is in good shape now, up from 41 percent in December and 33 percent in December 2013. But only 35 percent say their own family has mostly recovered from the recession and only 27 percent say their local job market has mostly emerged from the recession.
the economy. Hillary Clinton, the leading Democrat and a likely candidate, says the 2016 campaign will be dominated by questions of how to end stagnating wages and how to bring more Americans into the circle of prosperity. She wants to sound more populist and avoid criticism that she is too close to Wall Street. To those ends, Clinton is likely to emphasize middle-class tax relief, closing tax loopholes for the wealthy, and spending more money on infrastructure – all ideas that Obama has been promoting.
The potential Republican candidates are in a quandary. They are trying to decide whether to continue pressing the traditional conservative argument for tax cuts for everyone as a way to stimulate growth, or to focus more specifically on the middle class. The candidate who manages to capture the imagination of Middle America and emerge as a credible champion of 21st-century populism will be well in the way to winning the White House.
