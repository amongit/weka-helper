A fan has caught the moment a mass brawl erupted at a Euro 2016 qualifying football match between Serbia and Albania on Tuesday.
The video, filmed at Serbia's Partizan Stadium, shows a huge fight breaking out between opposition players after a remote-controlled drone hovered over the pitch carrying a politically provocative Albanian flag.
After a Serbian player tore down the flag, both sets of players became involved in a melee, causing the match to be abandoned.
