Tim Tebow Trained With Manny Pacquiao And They Have More In Common Than You Think
First the Eagles, now Manny Pacquiao?
Tim Tebow has been getting in a lot of training sessions lately. The former quarterback reportedly trained with the NFL franchise last week sparking freakouts that perhaps he was returning to the gridiron.
But maybe Tebow actually has his eyes set on the ring? Well, probably not. Tebow did spend some time Saturday with Pacquiao sparring for a few rounds in the boxer's training camp in Los Angeles,. The pair each shared a photo on their respective Instagram accounts and noted their shared religious beliefs.
Awesome being with my Filipino and Christian brother @emmanuelpacquiao #inspiration

The men have more in common than you think. While Tebow's is known well for his devout Christianity, Pacquiao has been open about his recently reformed turn as a born again Christian. And, as the AP reports, Tebow was born in Pacquiao's native Philippines while his parents were serving on a missionary.
Pacquiao is set to faceoff against Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on May 2.
