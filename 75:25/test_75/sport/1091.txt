Paralympic powerlifter has lifetime drug ban lifted after partner admits she spiked drink

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has overturned Azerbaijani powerlifter Gunduz Ismayilov's lifetime ban, imposed on him in 2004, after his former partner confessed in a court of law to spiking his drink with a substance which led to his second anti-doping violation in four years.
After serving a two-year ban for a failed drug test at the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, Ismayilov competed at the Athens 2004 Paralympics. At the Games, he returned an adverse analytical finding for Stanozolol metabolites (an anabolic steroid) and, under the World Anti-Doping Code (WADC) rules at the time, was banned for life by the IPC for his second anti-doping rule violation.
The decision by the IPC to overturn the ban now however comes after his former partner - an athlete who also competed in Athens - admitted in a Baku court of law that she had sabotaged his drink in the Athens Paralympic Village with a prohibited substance which led to the anti-doping violation. The two had separated in 2003, and although they had remained on good terms, she had spiked the drink as a form of punishment.
His former partner's admission only came about following an investigation spearheaded by the athlete and his lawyer to prove his innocence, during which Ismayilov has served nine years of his lifetime ban.
Dr. Toni Pascual, Chairperson of the IPC Anti-Doping Committee, said: "This is a very unique case with a unique set of circumstances. Under the IPC Anti-Doping Code, an athlete with a lifetime ban under the previous Code can request for their case to be reviewed under the rules of the present Code. In this case, providing that they had new and very relevant evidence had been determinant.

"Having received sufficient proof from the athlete, his National Paralympic Committee and the Azerbaijani court that his second violation was a result of sabotage, and not the athlete's own fault or negligence, the IPC has agreed to overturn his lifetime ban with immediate effect."
