Laura Trott OBE, 22, is a two-time Olympic gold medallist in omnium and team pursuit track cycling, of which she is the four-time world champion. She is an ambassador for Prudential RideLondon and will compete at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, which begin on Wednesday. She lives in Manchester with her boyfriend, fellow cyclist Jason Kenny, and their two dogs.
Routine The dogs sleep in my room even though Jason hates it. They wake up when the sun comes up. Breakfast is chocolate mini Weetabix on the sofa watching morning TV, and I am out on my bike by 8.30am. I go home for lunch at 12. Then my afternoon training is from 2-5pm. Jason and I usually have pasta for dinner and we have to be in front of the TV at 6pm to watch The Simpsons. We go to bed about 10pm.
Framed photo Cycling was the sport of our family – we did it all the time, five days a week. My dad was going to do the Prudential RideLondon last year. I wasn’t due to do it, but I thought I would wake up early and surprise him. He used to take me everywhere and bought me all the equipment so it was nice to have this moment together. He sent me this shot [pictured] afterwards of us with my friends Dani King, who I won the team pursuit with, and Anna Schnitzmeier, a German rider. It was so nice that it had obviously meant a lot to him too.

Twenty questions with ... Laura Trott
London Olympics 2012 Ever since I met Bradley Wiggins [aged 12] and he hung his gold medal around my neck I knew I wanted one of my own. Then Paul Manning, who was my coach at the time, told me I’d be going. The feeling of being told you are going to your first Olympic Games is amazing.
Superstitions I am very superstitious. I trod on a wet towel before winning the Junior World Championships and now I have to do that every time. I used to want to stick with certain bikes, like the one my parents bought me when I was 10, but you outgrow them so I can’t be superstitious about my bikes.
Toy dog When I was 10 my dad bought me this little toy dog. I didn’t really enjoy road riding at the time but that day I won. Since then it has just always been in my bag. He is a bit disgusting but I don’t wash him because I think it might wash the luck out.

Prince Harry Jason and I went to watch the volleyball [at the Olympics] and as we sat down all these bodyguards started walking in. Then Prince Harry sat next to me. I couldn’t believe it. He opened a beer bottle for us, because we didn’t have an opener, by whacking it on the chair next to him – the lid went flying and hit this woman on the back of the head. It was so funny, we couldn’t stop laughing.
Dogs One afternoon I was looking at dog breeds when I came across sproodles [a cross between an English springer spaniel and a poodle]. I just thought they were the cutest dogs. Sprolo, 18 months, was the first dog we got. Pringle is eight months and he was my Christmas present this year from Jason.
Post Olympics August 7 was the day I finished competing and that was where my planner ended; I was in no man’s land. Jason and I got a lot of attention because we both won two golds, and so that took some getting used to. But after two crazy weeks the weirdest thing was having all that freedom. Nobody prepares you for that.
Bracelet My mum gave me this bracelet for my 15th birthday. The next day I crashed and all the little diamonds fell out but I still thought it was lucky; I’ve worn it for every race. I was devastated I couldn’t wear it at the Olympics but I made my coach put it on the stopwatch around his neck.
