1. Saturday July 4, stage one: Utrecht, individual time trial, 14.0 km
The only individual time trial on the 2015 route comes on the very first day and it is not a particularly long one. At 13.7km, there is limited leeway for the general classification riders to take time out of each other although Chris Froome – if he enters – will still hope to have a little cushion on his rivals at the end of the first day.

2. Tuesday July 7, stage four: Seraing – Cambrai, 221km
Tour director Christian Prudhomme said at Wednesday’s route announcement that stage four, which returns to the pavé of northern France which caused such pandemonium this summer, would “shake, rattle and roll” the riders. If the weather is anywhere near as bad as this year, the 13.3km of cobbles will inevitably see some spills.

3. Sunday July 12, stage nine. Vannes to Plumelec 28km TTT
Aside from the first stage, the only other race against the clock in the 102nd edition comes on the ninth stage, a 28km team time trial. It is of particular note because it arrives, contrary to UCI regulations, outside the first week. Any team losing more than one rider in the first week - and with the cobbles on stage four that is a near certainty - could be seriously handicapped.

4. Wednesday July 22, stage 17: Digne-les-Bains – Pra-Loup, 161km
40 years on from Eddy Merckx’s famous dethroning at the hands of Frenchman Bernard Thévenet, who prevented the Belgian from winning a sixth Tour, the Pra-Loup summit features again. The stage also includes the rarely used Col d'Allos followed by a difficult descent which will have defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, an excellent descender, licking his lips.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Saturday July 25, stage 20: Modane – L’Alpe d’Huez, 110km
Spectacular summit finishes on the penultimate day can sometimes disappoint but there is every chance the 2015 race could be decided on the iconic and hugely popular Alpe d’Huez, which has featured 28 times since it was first used in 1952 when Fausto Coppi, the great Italian, dropped France's Jean Robic around 6km from the summit.
