Louis Van Gaal has suggested he would already consider extending his stay as Manchester United manager beyond the three years of his current contract.
The 63-year-old reiterated, as revealed in an exclusive interview with Telegraph Sport on Friday, that United would be his last job in management before he retired.
However Van Gaal suggested that having signed a three-year deal last summer he might be interested in another three-year deal after that which would take him close to his 69th birthday.
"That's correct," he said when asked whether United would indeed be his last club. "But there could be five years still to go. I can extend my contract. I have promised my wife, but you never know.
"I've signed for three years because in three years you can build up something.

"The club agreed with that. I don't know what how I shall react in the circumstances. When Manchester United ask me to extend, then I shall decide. But this is my last club."
Van Gaal said there were no regrets that he did not take over at Liverpool when he expressed an interest in becoming the manager before Brendan Rodgers was appointed.
