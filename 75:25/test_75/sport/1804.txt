Is There Room For Pro Athletes At The Olympics? (VOTE)
This past Thursday night the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team beat Nigeria 156-73 in a game that was little shock to most Olympic viewers. It was a fantastic game, with the U.S. leading by 26 in the first quarter and a new record of 78 points in the first half and Carmelo Anthony scoring 10 out of 12 3-pointers, but we expected nothing less of America's biggest basketball stars. With professionals of this level of skill and expertise, is it hardly fair to pit them against other teams in the Olympics?
Does having seven-figure salaried celebrities in the mix give a disadvantage to amateurs? Is there room for pro athletes in the Olympics or should we save the spotlight for budding athletic stars? Vote and leave your thoughts below,
Yes! They're athletes too.
No. It isn't fair to other teams.
