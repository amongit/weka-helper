South Africa’s reward for demolishing Sri Lanka – their first victory in five World Cup knock-out matches – is a semi-final in Auckland on Tuesday.
It might be thought that there is an advantage in playing the first semi-final, as it gives the winners more time to prepare for the final. But of the 10 World Cups to date, five have been won by the country winning the first semi-final, and five by the country winning the second, so momentum would seem to be no less important.
Having rattled out Sri Lanka for only 133, there was no scope for South Africa to freeze or choke. They did not even have to chase: it was just a late afternoon stroll in Sydney as they won with nine wickets and 192 balls to spare.
Whether South Africa’s opponents in the Auckland semi turn out to be New Zealand or West Indies, South Africa are well-equipped after getting over this historic hurdle and boosting their confidence. Of five previous knock-out matches in World Cups, four had ended in defeat, the other an infamous tie, but here they did not waver for a moment.
South Africa’s batting, pace bowling and fielding are always strong. What was remarkable on this occasion was that their two spinners took seven wickets, including a hat-trick for Jean-Paul Duminy, the ninth in a World Cup: 17.2 overs, seven for 55 were their figures combined.

It was, truth be told, one of the less devastating pieces of bowling to achieve a hat-trick. Angelo Mathews slog-swept the last ball of one over to midwicket, then Duminy knocked over a couple of tailenders with straight balls: Nuwan Kulasekara, thin-edging a straight one to the keeper, his successor pinned chest-on and leg-before.
Imran Tahir was more influential and rightly man of the match. For a feast of what is best in the world game, this tournament has been short of wrist-spin, but South Africa’s practitioner – born in Pakistan – showed what could be done by taking four wickets on a pitch that was so far from being a turner that Sri Lanka selected only one of their specialist spinners.
As flamboyant as Abdul Qadir, on whom his action is modelled, Tahir transfers a lot of the bounce in his body - as he bounds to the wicket - into the ball. A Test career had never quite worked out after he became a naturalised citizen, but South Africa’s selectors saw the possibilities of an attacking spinner in one-day cricket – and how right they were.
South Africa’s pace bowlers, although they only took three wickets, were no less excellent. Dale Steyn pinned Tillakaratne Dilshan down for six consecutive balls, preventing Sri Lanka’s big-shot opener from getting off the mark. Steyn’s seventh ball was flapped, rather than forced, low to second slip.
Dilshan’s opening partner had already gone by then. Sri Lanka’s squad has contained 20 players at one time or another, so frequent have their injuries been, and Kusal Perera was not a first choice - nor did he bat like one.
So South Africa’s seamers made sure that Sri Lanka started badly, and their spinners that there was no recovery. The seamers pegged Sri Lanka to 47 for two from 14 overs; the spinners restricted them to 89 for four after 26 overs; and a combination finished them off so soon that South Africa had to begin their innings before the dinner break.

For Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene there was no last hurrah. Jayawardene, 37, did little in this World Cup beyond a century against Afghanistan, and mistiming a pull against Tahir to midwicket made an inglorious exit from one-day internationals.
But if Jayawardene has got worse with age, Sangakkara has only improved. Also 37, he has been the highest run-scorer in this tournament – when on five he passed 500 runs. But in trying to compile his fifth consecutive century he erred on the side of being over-careful.
Sangakkara could not play high-risk shots as wickets kept falling at the other end, but if there was a passage where Sri Lanka lost whatever initiative they had, never to regain it, it was when Sangakarra faced 25 balls from Duminy – barely turning offbreaks – and pushed them for only 10 singles and a two.
Which all goes to prove that this game of cricket defies mastery. Sangakkara has finished as the second highest run-scorer of all time in ODIs, and the leading wicketkeeper in terms of dismissals, but he misjudged the tempo required here. Lahiru Thirimanne did his bit to get Sri Lanka going, with 41 off 48 balls, but Sangakkara went down without a shot in anger until the batting powerplay had to be taken, when he was forced to accelerate from his 34 off 88 balls.
Because Sri Lanka’s innings ended prematurely, South Africa had to begin their reply straightaway, after a 10-minute break: no time to think about history and chasing and choking. Spurred by their young left-hander Quinton de Kock, South Africa sped to 40 for the loss of Hashim Amla, caught carving to third man, in less than seven overs before the major interval.
If there was any history to ponder, it was of a one-day international between these two countries in Paarl in January 2012. Six members of each side who played in that match were playing in the quarter-final, so it would not have been entirely forgotten – and in that game, on a pitch where South Africa had reached 300, Sri Lanka were 43 all out, their lowest ever total.
De Kock, dropped when 61, finished on 78 from 57 balls. Sangakkara, standing behind him as keeper, and watching the flourishes of youthful exuberance, might have thought of himself when young. They warmly embraced at the end, past and future.
