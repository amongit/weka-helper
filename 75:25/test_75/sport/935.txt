Chris Froome has said that his painful exit from the Tour de France last year has left him “a lot hungrier” to reclaim his crown this season, adding that he will be helped by what he believes to be “the strongest all-round team” Team Sky have had.
Froome, 29, crashed on stage five of the 2014 Tour after three spills in two days. The 2013 champion’s exit was followed by that of Alberto Contador, Tinkoff-Saxo’s two-time champion, leaving Astana’s Vincenzo Nibali with a relatively trouble-free run to Paris.
Contador and Froome came back one month later to take first and second respectively at the Vuelta a España, and the Kenya-born Briton said that with those two, plus Nibali and mountain goats like Nairo Quintana and Joaquim Rodríguez, this summer’s Tour was likely be the most competitive in years. “It is going to be a battle – that’s the perfect way to describe it,” he told Sky Sports News.
“It’s going to be a big showdown. Especially if last year’s Vuelta is to go by. Contador is going to be the guy I am measuring myself against. Having said that, I don’t think I can rule out any other big general classification riders; Quintana, Nibali, Rodríguez, [Alejandro] Valverde.”
Froome added that Sky’s new signings for 2015, which include Nicolas Roche, Leopold Konig, and Wout Poels, meant he would be entering the race with “the strongest all-round team we’ve ever had” and said he was keen to capitalise. “Last year with the crash, definitely that means I am back a lot hungrier, a lot more eager to get back.”
