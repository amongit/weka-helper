Aaron Ramsey has admitted he is struggling to reproduce the form he displayed for Arsenal this time last season and blamed a succession of injuries for his below-par performances.
Ramsey, who played the full ninety minutes as Wales boosted their Euro 2016 qualification hopes with a 0-0 draw against Belgium in Brussels on Sunday, has been sidelined with ankle and hamstring injuries this season and has failed to find the net since scoring in the 2-2 draw at Everton in August.
By this stage of last season, the 23-year-old midfielder had scored 13 goals for club and country and emerged as the inspiration behind Arsenal’s rise to the top of the Premier League.
But with his form slumping this season, Ramsey insists criticism of his contribution has been harsh by claiming that he will not be able to produce his best until he is fully fit.
"I've had a few injuries this season and I'm just getting back,” Ramsey said. “To be honest, I'm still not 100 per cent physically there.

“The injuries do take a bit out of me and it will take me a few more games to be back to my best.
"But I'm not worried. I know my qualities and certain criticism from people is unfair."
Ramsey’s return to the Wales team against Belgium after missing the recent qualifiers against Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina enabled the former Cardiff youngster to step up his search for fitness.
And with Chris Coleman’s team extending their unbeaten run in the group, Ramsey admits that confidence in the Welsh camp is such that they can target a positive result in their next fixture, away to group leaders Israel in March.
"We will go to Israel now full of confidence and hopefully be more dangerous with the ball,” Ramsey said. “Hopefully it will be a more comfortable game for us than in Belgium.
"Belgium away was one of the two toughest games we are going to play away from home. Bosnia is also not going to be an easy game.
"But we have passed one test and we have a few more games now in between where we can get some more wins and keep the points tally going up."
