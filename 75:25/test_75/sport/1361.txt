Call the sculptor. Give the bunting guys a holler and light the fondue. They'll be hoisting a few tonight in Zurich and that's for sure. Roger's trophy cabinet is complete. SWITZERLAND WIN THE DAVIS CUP!

Gasquet 4-6, 2-6, 2-6 Federer* Roger inches towards the title point by point. He's done it! Another love game and the Davis Cup title is won with the lightest of touches. Standing O in the arena,. Tears from Federer. A great, great performance from Federer. Possibly one of the best we have seen from him on clay. And Gasquet deserves a lot of credit for his showing.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-6, 2-5 Federer A must-win game for Gasquet now. It reaches 0-30 before Gasquet whips a backhand down the left to beat Fed. Superb shot but these are few and far between. Hang on though. He just unleashed a superb crosscourt forehand. It's 30-30. And now it's quarante-trente until Federer with consumate ease let's fly with a backhand in the left corner. Battling perfermance there from Gasquet. He sprints to the net and smashes. Great recovery. Advantage him. But now the pendulum swings Fed's way and it's 16th break point for him.
Federer is a game away from history.
Gasquet 4-6, 2-6, 2-4 Federer* This is too easy now for Fed.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-6, 2-3 Federer That game was notable for a cracking bit of serve and volley from Gasquet who just dinks the ball over the net as Federer races forward. A long long rally featuring backhand after backhand and Federer picks his shot. Deuce. I'll say again - what bad back. Federer's mobility is amazing. He wins the game. It's 3-2 to Fed in the third set.
Gasquet 4-6, 2-6, 2-2 Federer* Oof. Federer is making mistakes. The French partisans cheer but Fed wins his next point with a trademark will-he-won't-he shot to the right hand corner. We are at deuce. Line call now and the umpire gets out of his seat to do a human HawkEye. He points at the scuff mark and Federer must serve again. A brilliant return from Gasquet. But Roger counters that with a lovely serve and volley move. He wins the service game.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-6, 2-1 Federer Some valiant mixing-it-up from Gasquet now. It's a love game to him. He's holdng serve. Allez le Bleu.
Gasquet 4-6, 2-6, 1-1 Federer* Is Gasquet beginning a fightback here? A long rally ends with Federer skying the ball into row Z. But inevitably Federer crushes all hope and takes the next three points. Game Federer. The sound of cowbells fills the air.
Faithful blogwatcher John McEnerney has been in touch: "Hi Cameron, glad you made it, they're big boys & Stan should have taken it (the sledging) better, I'm sure he's heard worse. He knows Mirka long enough to know what she is like & it's about time there was a little niggle in the sport it's been all too buddy buddy of late. I'm sure Roger has a GS final in him but I think if he's to win one or two more it will be because the others in The Big 3 (Murray is out) will falter before the final. Rafa & Novak have the upper hand still in the mental side of things which is Feds weakness against them. He's off to a flyer here & has the bit between teeth could be over in 3 but Fed is prone to a few lapses every match so it may go to 4. Plenty of "Come On" shouts from Fed which always a good sign. Enjoy the rest of the match." Cheers John.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-6, 1-0 Federer Can Gasquet win the next three sets to beat Federer? Erm. Not on this showing. That concept of 'flow' much beloved of rock climbers (and people who do tai-chi) is fully evident here. He seems to be anticipating Gasquet's every move and moving accordingly. But Richard is still trying. We are now at deuce. And Gas serves a lovely ace stright down the middle of the court! A long rally ensues and it's advantage Federer as he picks Gasquet off with a shot down the left. But some lovely footwork from Gasquet there. He moves to the net and punds the ball past Fed before he can reach the ball. And the Frenchman leads the first set. Ballons of steel from him to win that.
Gasquet 4-6, 2-6 Federer* He's on fire now. Gasquet looks like a broken man. Another love game. We are just one set away from a historic first Davis Cup title for Switzerland.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-5 Federer More pressure on Gassa as he loses the first point. Then the next one. And the next one. (With a booming cross-court return of serve from Rog that whips past him). And inevitably, Federer wins that game too.
Gasquet 4-6, 2-4 Federer* Allez! Gasquet wins the first point and pumps his fist. Fed wins the next one but the following point is fluffed. The crowd roars. "Richard! Richard!" But Fed leaps like a salmon to win the overhead. No back trouble here, Roger, eh, you dodgder? He takes the game.
Gasquet* 4-6, 2-3 Federer Gasquet mixes it up now and smashes the ball down the middle. But Federer's return of serve is a thing of beauty. The Frenchman isn't done though and whips the ball down the line past Fed. Gasquet wins the next point but that early break of serve may be his undoing.
Gasquet 4-6, 1-3 Federer* Fed is pumped up now and comes back onto the court before he is asked by the ump. A lovely little exchange there with Federer inching closer to the net with each return. Gasquet hits it into the net. His forehand return is a weakenes which Federer expoits. Another love service game to Rog!
Gasquet* 4-6, 1-2 Federer Toilet break for Cammy! I return to find Gasquet has pulled one game back to keep hope alive.
Gasquet 4-6, 0-2 Federer* Another easy game won by Federer. He has taken nine successive sets against Gasquet I'm told.
Gasquet* 4-6, 0-1 Federer Two break points for Federer who breaks for the second time in the match. The man in red just improves as the match goes on.
Gasquet 4-6 Federer* Federer moves like a thoroughbred racehorse as he gracefully serves Gasquet to death. Ok mixed metaphors. But the bottom line is that Fed has just won that game to love and takes the set. Wonderful stuff.
Gasquet* 4-5 Federer Lovely drive down the line to make it 0-15 to Fed. Gasquet was nowhere near. A powerful forehand is followed by the deftest of dinks over the net. 0-30. But Gas wins the next point in similarly confident style. Now a short rally ends with a Gas return going long. Two set points now. Gas is not giving up though. He wins the next point and aces to make it 'egalite'. 40-40 in English.
Bad miss from Gas on his backhand side. It goes wide. But he wins the next point with a short forehand volley at the net. The crowd is loud. And Gasquet saves three set points. That was a serve brilliantly held by the Frenchman.
Gasquet 3-5 Federer* Hello. Terrible tube trouble in London but a feast of tennis in France. Federer just motored through that game like a freight train. His second love game.
Gasquet* 3-4 Federer Signs are good for Gassers as he fairly romps through this game to 40-0. But then he blots his copybook with the first double fault of the match, and then makes an error of judgement as he gives Roger too much space. He can only watch as Fed scorches a winner past him, and he's soon under pressure in the next one as well when Gasquet, pinned back on the baseline, spoons a sitter up half court. Roger tucks that away and it's deuce before you can say Jack Robinson. Roger wins the next one as well and he's got another BP. He hits a groundstroke long. Eventually gets out of jail and he wins the game. My man Cam is here and he'll talk you through the rest of this passionately contested encounter. Cheers.
Gasquet 2-4 Federer* Game Roger.
Gasquet* 2-3 Federer Battling game from Gasquet keeps him in touch.
Gasquet 1-3 Federer* Chances for Gas at 0-30 but he can't do much with a return and Fed has soon dragged himself back into the game at 30-30. He needs a deuce, and there are three errors in the game all told, but Roger just about uses his experience to get over the line and consolidate that break.
Gasquet* 1-2 Federer At 40-30, Gasquet has been under pressure and Roger scorches a winner that clips the line. Gasquet disputes it so the umpire comes out of his chair to personally show him where it landed on the white stripe. Gasquet concedes the point. A lovely drop shot now gives Roger a break point. Big moment early on. Needs a second serve. Gasquet well on top in the point, but he's unwisely fed the FEderer forehand a ball that's too short, and there's a big space gaping to Gasquet's left. Federer slides across the baseline and hammers a winner home. Break to Roger!
Gasquet 1-1 Federer* Roger with an imperious backhand winner and now a clever dropshot to 30-0. Top class serving sees that game out with something of a statement made.
Gasquet* 1-0 Federer A partisan crowd roars in delight as Gasquet, serving, wins the first point thanks to a Federer backhand error. He soon takes it to 40-0, the third point a long rally. Roger gets on the board after a Gasquet groundstroke goes awry and a sizeable Swiss/Federer contingent cheers wildly. Anyway, Gasquet soon wraps the game up to 15, he got 4/5 first serves in, and the atmosphere is quite splendid. John McEnerney writes:
Hi Alan, even with all the home support I can't see RG sticking one on Federer not when the prize is so close, Roger looked flat on Friday but yesterday he played well & I can see him coming out all guns blazing & not let RG settle. If RG gets going it could be a 5 setter but the longer it goes on the stronger Fed will get! Federer in 4 & to finally get his hands on The Davis Cup. Enjoy it Alan!
12.00 Hello everyone, Alan Tyers here as a late sub for Cameron Macphail to bring you news of Roger Federer taking on Richard Gasquet. If Fed wins, the Swiss win the Cup. The players are out on court, Roger in a red shirt that matches the indoor court, more or less, and Gasquet in blue. Game on!

Richard Gasquet has replaced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for France in the crucial opening reverse singles against Switzerland's Roger Federer in the Davis Cup final today.
French No 1 Tsonga had been slotted to take on the Swiss star, but he has been struggling with an injury to his right arm and was very down emotionally after his opening day loss to Stan Wawrinka.
Federer also lost on Friday in straight sets to Gael Monfils, but he was given a huge boost on Saturday when he and Wawrinka teamed up to defeat Gasquet and Julien Benneteau in straight sets in the doubles.
That gave the Swiss a 2-1 lead and needing just one more point to win the Davis Cup for the first time.
Federer is now in position to supply that extra win and it was Gasquet who filled the first French morning training slot out on the indoor claycourt at the roofed-over Lille football stadium.
With Monfils certain to take the second training slot to prepare for a potential fifth match decider against Wawrinka it was a clear indication that Tsonga would not play.
In head-to-heads Federer leads Gasquet 12-2, but both of Gasquet's wins came on clay - in their first ever meeting in Monte Carlo in 2005 and in Rome in 2011.
Their only meeting this year resulted in a 6-1, 6-2 win for Federer in the Masters Series tournament in Miami.
Cameron Macphail will be here from 11.30am to bring you latest news before live coverage
