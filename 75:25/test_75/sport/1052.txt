Qatar 2022 World Cup: English football is rich enough to absorb this disruption to the Premier League schedule

The main reasons for deploring a World Cup in Qatar 2022 revolve around the fishy nature of the bidding process, further evidence of Fifa’s institutionalised greed and the scandal of migrant workers dying on stadium construction sites. Moving Manchester City’s kick-off with Chelsea in the 2022-23 season ranks only fourth on the list of legitimate grievances against Qatar, and Premier League officials are adept at moving kick-off times anyway.
The tournament simply should not be held in Qatar. Australia was the logical choice for 2022 in terms of selecting an emerging footballing power who had not hosted the event. A World Cup in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere in that fabulous sporting country would have been in June and July, would have played out before ecstatic crowds in a region that has never hosted it. The United States put in a powerful bid but Uncle Sam has hosted the party before, amid sweltering conditions in 1994.
Sadly, the argument for alternative venues has been lost amid the usual Fifa self-interest. Qatar it is and it will be a competition forever stigmatised. The world is stuck with this stain on the beautiful game.
On the basis that Fifa will not suddenly find the path to righteousness and switch the World Cup away from Qatar, the issue of timing has to be addressed. It could not be held in the summer, in conditions that would be manageable in the air-conditioned grounds but wretched for travelling supporters, let alone the players in training. It has to be a winter World Cup, whatever the inconvenience for the major European leagues. Conveniently for Michel Platini, who voted for Qatar, Uefa’s beloved Champions League could operate with only minimal disruption in 2022‑23, assuming the group stage concludes before the World Cup starts and then resumes after the Dec 23 final.
The domestic leagues will be hit hardest, especially the Premier League with its historic and enjoyably manic Christmas and New Year holiday programme, which is bound to be affected by players arriving back after Qatar. Amid all the jokes about England being home before the Christmas cards, there is an argument that they will be less exhausted at the World Cup, having fought their way through only half the draining domestic season rather than the full 10-month assault course. For fans of their national teams, Christmas has come early. So that’s Christmas shopping on Dec 23, followed by some carol singing, then settle down to Germany against France in the 2022 final in the Lord Foster-designed Lusail Iconic Stadium.

A Christmas World Cup? Reaction and news
The outcome of the Qatar shift to winter, which has been recommended by the Fifa task force and should be ratified by Fifa next month, is undeniably hugely frustrating for club supporters, who will have their favourite soap opera placed on hold while another drama is screened. Fans’ organisations should have been consulted by Fifa.
Yet English football is big enough, intelligent enough and wealthy enough to absorb the disruption to its 2022-23 season. It will lead to a chaotic, expanded season, probably beginning in July and ending in June wrapped around the November-December World Cup with collateral damage to FA Cup replays. Yet it is manageable. The Premier League will have raked in close to £10 billion in television revenue by then.
Its chief executive, Richard Scudamore, is such a talented strategic thinker that he can surely juggle the fixture list without impacting on his competition’s “sporting integrity”. The Premier League’s “sporting integrity” would be more undermined should Scudamore revive the ill-conceived “39th game”. For such an innovative mind as Scudamore’s, he could depict the World Cup as a mid‑season celebration of the stellar performers in the world’s most popular league, an all-star break.
An innate sense of English arrogance permeated Scudamore’s statement expressing how “extremely disappointed” his organisation was with the task force’s recommendation. Given that English clubs have clambered all over international football, forcing the reduction in the number of friendlies, there will be little sympathy for the Premier League.
There remains the strong suspicion that what really irks Scudamore is that when he comes to negotiating television, radio, internet and probably snapchat rights for the period encompassing the World Cup, he will not be able to offer such a tempting, non-stop diet of matches for domestic and overseas broadcasters. Scudamore concluded his statement with a threat of legal action, rather than a critical appraisal of Qatar’s right to host the World Cup. Surprise, surprise. Qatar pours money into English football. It all comes down to money for the Premier League and for Fifa. All the fish are sold – in time for Christmas.
