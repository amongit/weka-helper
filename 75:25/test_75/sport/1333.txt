Ulster 26 Leicester Tigers 7: Defeat for Leicester compounded by Geoff Parling's injury

A knee injury to Geoff Parling that may rule the lock out of England's Six Nations opener against Wales capped a miserable night for Leicester in Belfast as Ulster's final act of their Champions Cup campaign was to ensure that the Tigers also suffered the same fate.
Parling was forced out of the action in the third minute and while the full extent of the injury will only be confirmed once he is assessed by Leicester's medical team on Sunday, the club's director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, said on Saturday night that he expected it would sideline the 31-year-old Lions forward for "three to four weeks."
The loss of Parling, who had only just returned to top form following three months off after three head injuries, would be a major blow to England head coach Stuart Lancaster, who is already resigned to being without Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes because of injury. England's opening game of the championship is against Wales in Cardiff on Feb 6.
"It is a bit soon to say, he has hurt his MCL [medial cruciate ligament] on the inside of his knee and we will see how bad that is but it will be a few weeks I would imagine," said Cockerill. "It is nothing too drastic but it will be three to four weeks probably.
"He will come back with us tonight and be assessed by our medical people and he will obviously go to England and report there and have the assessment."

Leicester had gone into the contest clinging to the hope that a bonus-point win would keep them in the mix for reaching the quarter-finals via one of the three best-placed runners-up spots. But they were outgunned, as their competitive losing streak in Belfast which now stretches to four matches continued.
Leicester could muster only a second-half try by Adam Thompstone and even when Ulster lost Callum Black and Wiehahn Herbst to the sin-bin as they conceded a rash of penalties, the Tigers could not force their way back into the contest.
"Ultimately we got what we deserved to be honest," added Cockerill. "They defended very well. There were multiple penalties against them in the second half and the referee dealt with it as he saw fit.
"They scored four tries to our one, they were very good and we were not as good as we could have been but they did not let us."
Ulster's bonus-point victory was laced with such verve and gusto that their supporters were no doubt left wondering why this was only their second victory in Pool Three.
If their victory was founded on a superb line speed in defence and the physicality of their breakdown, the cutting edge was provided in particular by Ulster centre Darren Cave.
Cave, who shares his alma mater, Sullivan Upper School, with Rory McIlroy, scored a hat-trick of tries in a performance that will press his claims for a place in Ireland's Six Nations squad.
Joe Schmidt, the Ireland head coach, will also have been buoyed by blindside flanker Iain Henderson's impressive return to action after a seven-month lay-off with a hip injury, while Craig Gilroy also caught the eye and deservedly crossed for Ulster's fourth try at the start of the second half.
"We talked in the last couple of months about not being accurate enough but I think tonight was the opposite," said Cave. "We scored four tries and probably only had about five opportunities. We didn't leave a lot out there.
"Our line speed was a lot better and we got up in their faces and took the contact on our terms. Their big runners struggled to get into the game and we dealt with them pretty well.
"At the end, when we were down to 13 and 14 men, they were in our 22 and kicking the ball away because there was nowhere to go."
The second half began as the first finished, with Cave showing great strength this time to cross for his third try and complete a remarkable hat-trick.
From the restart Craig Gilroy, like Cave another trying to force himself back into the mind of Schmidt, set off on a pirouetting surge that brought the Ravenhill crowd to its feet.
Leicester then lost Niki Goneva to the sin-bin and, in his absence, Ulster were able to cross the line for their bonus-point try from a simple first-phase move from a scrum that resulted in a touchdown for Gilroy.
Leicester's fate was sealed and although some sloppy defending by Ulster allowed Thompstone to wriggle his way over for a try before Goneva's return, it was scant consolation.
