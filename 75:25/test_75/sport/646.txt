England goalscorer Daniel Sturridge inspired by his mother in World Cup 2014 clash with Italy

Daniel Sturridge has revealed how he used his mother’s birthday as inspiration to try to get England off to a winning start in Brazil.
The Liverpool striker scored on his World Cup debut but was left “heartbroken” by England’s defeat in Manaus. His mother, Grace, celebrated her birthday hours after England’s opening Group D game. “I was just trying my heart out to make her happy and put a smile on her face as well,” Sturridge, 24, said.
“Obviously, I’m gutted we didn’t win the game because I feel like I’ve let, not just everyone in England, but my family down as well. I’m disappointed and heartbroken because I do feel we deserved something out of the game.”
Roy Hodgson, the England manager, did not agree with this assessment, describing Sturridge's performance as “exceptional”.
Sturridge said: “I’m thankful to God for giving me the opportunity, I’m thankful for everything that’s come my way. I’m humbled by being able to play in a World Cup.

“A year ago, 18 months ago, I never thought I’d be in this position to be honest with you. There were no nerves at all because I know what we’re capable of. People saw that, we knew in training and throughout the week going into this game, feeling extremely confident in ourselves as a team. I just think we didn’t get the breaks we deserved, but I’m so excited for the next game against Uruguay because I know we can do a job on them if we play like we did against Italy, so it’s a good feeling.”
Although he insisted that he was not nervous, Sturridge admitted that he had to calm himself down ahead of the Italy game and would probably have to do so again before the Uruguay clash on Thursday.
Hodgson has claimed that England must beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to progress into the knockout stages.
Sturridge said: “I had so much adrenalin before the Italy game, I was trying to calm myself down the night before. I had moves running through my head, thinking about doing this or doing that, so many things going through my mind before the game and throughout the week.
“It seemed such a long week leading up to it. It’ll be the same for Uruguay because, to me, four days seems such a long time to wait for the next game. It will be a long time to mull over a defeat. But at the same time we can take the positives out of the game and we can look forward to the next one.”
Sturridge was forced off with a dead leg against Italy, but he insisted that he would be fit to face Uruguay. “[Giorgio] Chiellini gave me a knee in the thigh and it was quite painful. I tried running it off and kept going, but I looked up and saw my number and I was a bit disappointed to come off because I was trying to carry on. These things happen and I’ll be ready, I’ll be all right for Thursday. I’ll get treatment, so I’m sure I’ll be fine.”
