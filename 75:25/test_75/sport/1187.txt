Tony Pulis demanded managers be given two 30-second “video callbacks” per match to challenge a referee’s decision after the astonishing mistaken-identity dismissal of West Brom defender Gareth McAuley.
Referee Neil Swarbrick is understood to have admitted at half-time that he erred in red-carding McAuley when he had penalised West Brom for a foul on City striker Wilfried Bony after 89 seconds by Craig Dawson.

“I can’t believe he has picked the wrong player. He sent off the wrong player,” Pulis said after his side’s 3-0 defeat which eased the pressure a little on Manuel Pellegrini. “Refereeing is not easy. This product [the Premier League] is one of the greatest products we sell over the world,” Pulis said. “We have to help referees out. Managers have to have two calls each for 30 seconds per match with a video link-up upstairs. It will eradicate the major decisions the referees are getting wrong.”
In case he was accused of creating a smokescreen — given the argument that even though Swarbrick sent off the wrong player he was nevertheless right to reduce West Brom to 10 men — Pulis also claimed the sending-off highlighted the “inconsistency” of referees.
“I watched the Wolves-Derby game last night and there was a very similar incident in that game where the Wolves player stopped a player going through and there was not even a yellow card,” he said. “It [refereeing] is a very tough job and I get animated watching but we have had the rough end of it.”
Pulis said he had called Mike Riley, the general manager of the PGMOL, which oversees the referees, to protest at decisions against his club. “He always rings back and discusses the situation,” Pulis said. “Referees should get closer to the professional game, of course they should, and this [video technology] is one way of doing that by giving the referee a chance to redeem a mistake.”
Either way it is a severe embarrassment to the Premier League coming so soon after referee Roger East mistakenly sent off Sunderland defender Wes Brown — instead of John O’Shea — against Manchester United last month.
Off: McAuley cannot believe it as he is shown the red card
That it was another case of mistaken identity was undeniable. Bony was bundled over by Dawson before getting back to his feet only to be challenged by McAuley inside the penalty area. Swarbrick had already blown and awarded a free-kick — instead of a spot-kick — so was clearly penalising Dawson. But then he dismissed McAuley.
The consensus was that whatever the identity it was still a red card but it was not an absolutely clear-cut denial of a goal-scoring opportunity.

Either way it killed any hope of this encounter being a contest.
City were utterly dominant. The shot count — 43 to three in the home side’s favour – reflected their superiority even more than the eventual scoreline and it was only the frame of the goal and some fine saves from Boaz Myhill that prevented a heavier defeat.

After the losses against Burnley and in midweek away to Barcelona in the Champions League this became an even more important fixture for Pellegrini, who made seven changes from the side who lost in the Nou Camp.
City needed to win to shore up a campaign where they were in danger of not only surrendering their league title but possibly dropping out of the top four which would end Pellegrini’s already diminished chances of staying on.
At last: Wilfried Bony finally gets his first City goal
What was curious here, however, was just how sorry Pulis’s side felt for themselves once they had gone a man down. In fairness this was partly because City were so unrelenting in their desire to break them down, with David Silva orchestrating wave after wave of attack.
Inevitably they broke through with Bony claiming his first goal since his £25million move from Swansea City as the ball rebounded to him from a blocked Fernando shot. The striker’s deft first touch was vital as he controlled the ball before steering it into the net.
A second goal was inevitable. It came from a corner with Eliaquim Mangala flicking the ball on. It fell to Jonas Olsson who miscued as Myhill tried to gather and Fernando poked it home.

Pulis claimed Mangala had kicked one of his player’s in the face but his protest was desperate — just like his team’s defending. They were indebted to Myhill who denied Sergio Agüero on four occasions — including an instinctive point-blank block with his feet — before the City striker cannoned a shot off the post only for Bony to strike the rebound against the crossbar.
Finally West Brom created a chance, with Olsson turning a corner goalwards only for Saido Berahino to head against the bar from two yards out. The rebound fell to Lescott — but he headed over. All hope was extinguished when the ball was pulled back to City substitute Stevan Jovetic on the area’s edge with his low shot then diverted in by Silva.
For Pellegrini there was relief. “It was a comfortable win because we played with one player more for 89 minutes,” he admitted. Can City catch Chelsea? “I don’t think that our fans don’t believe we can do it,” he added. He did not sound convinced.
