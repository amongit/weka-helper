Barcelona v Manchester City: Vincent Kompany has final opportunity to justify his 'presidential' billing

They call Vincent Kompany the ‘Presi­dent’ in Belgium, partly out of respect for his elevated status as the country’s leading footballer but also because of the perception that whatever the Manchester City captain wants he usually gets.
Similarly, during the latter stages of Roberto Mancini’s reign as manager at the Etihad Stadium, the Italian and his staff began to refer to Kompany as the ‘Professor’ on the basis of the centre-half’s readiness to offer an opinion on the rights and wrongs of any given situation.
Against Barcelona on Wednesday night, a game which is likely to prove to be the last Champions League chance for many of City’s squad may also offer Kompany a final opportunity to justify his presidential billing on the European stage as he attempts to emerge from the most prolonged and worrying form slump of his career.

That neither of Kompany’s nicknames are particularly affectionate will not trouble the City captain, 28, who will lead Manuel Pellegrini’s team in their bid to overturn a 2-1 round-of-16 deficit against Barcelona in the Nou Camp to progress to the quarter-finals.
Both stem from Kompany’s contribution on the pitch for the club and country, with his performances at the heart of the defence for City and Belgium rightly earning him a ­reputation as one of the world’s best defenders and a genuine rival to the likes of John Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic as the outstanding Premier League centre-half of the past decade.
However, having been dropped by Pellegrini this month days after clashing with team-mate Fernandinho during the half-time interval of City’s 2-1 defeat by Liverpool, Kompany faces Lionel Messi and Co no longer certain of his position among Pellegrini’s untouchables.

Until Kompany was put on the bench for the home victory against Leicester City, he shared equal billing alongside Yaya Touré, David Silva and Sergio Agüero as players simply too important to be dropped by Pellegrini.
Such was Kompany’s standing at the club, where his voice is heard and listened to at the very top of City’s Abu Dhabi hierarchy, the former Hamburg defender admitted recently that he would not even swap the Etihad Stadium for the Nou Camp if Barcelona came calling.
“I don’t plan to leave Manchester City,” Kompany said. “I feel a bond with Manchester as a place and with the fans. I would not even leave to join Barcelona. I cannot think of any club where I could have as much influence as I have here.”

Kompany’s influence grated with Mancini, but it is embraced by Marc Wilmots, the Belgium coach, who acceded to his captain’s request for a separate meeting with defenders and additional analysis prior to the World Cup finals last summer.
When asked last week whether he allowed Kompany the same kind of influence behind the scenes at City, however, Pellegrini was quick to stress the lines of demarcation. “I analyse the performance of the ­players with the players,” the Chilean said.
“We will continue working this way to get our best performance. He [Kompany] doesn’t have a problem with the way we defend.”
Whether Kompany strays beyond his remit as captain, losing his focus on the responsibility of defending, is open to debate.

He does not project the brash ‘Guv’nor’ image which curtailed Paul Ince’s career at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, but the Fernandinho episode, when the Brazilian midfielder scolded Kompany for his first-half display, shed light on the irritation of some with the captain’s sphere of influence.
Some City staff have remarked on Kompany’s aloofness, yet he remains a popular member of the Belgium squad, where his studious nature is regarded with less suspicion and attributed to a rounded personality and field of interest beyond football, including politics and literature.
However, the root of his problems this season stem from a decline on the pitch, with the injuries – repeated muscle strains affecting calf and groin – of the past two seasons continuing into this campaign.

Kompany was at fault for Liverpool’s first goal at Anfield recently and also performed poorly during the first leg against Barcelona last month.
His habit of diving into tackles has become a weakness. The increasing regularity of being left on the ground after a challenge has been noted within the game and regarded as a sign of misjudgment and bad decision-making.
In mitigation, Kompany has struggled to form a consistent partnership at centre-half, with only Martin Demichelis, with his excellent reading of the game and calmness, complementing the captain’s game.
Eliaquim Mangala, the £42 million summer signing from Porto, has so far done little to suggest that he can succeed where Stefan Savic, Joleon Lescott and Matija Nastasic failed in forming a reliable partnership with Kompany. But having dropped Kompany, Pellegrini delivered a warning that his form had led to him losing his position.
So when he steps on to the Nou Camp pitch on Wednesday night, the City captain needs to perform like a president rather than a lame duck.
