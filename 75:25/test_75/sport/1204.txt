Fifa fails to punish a dozen of clear racist and homophobic incidents at World Cup 2014, according to Fare report

Fifa has failed to punish a dozen clear incidents of discrimination at the World Cup, according to a damning report by world football’s leading equality campaigners.
An analysis by the Fare Network of racist and homophobic activity during the tournament in Brazil found it to have reached double figures ahead of this week’s semi-finals.
None of those incidents were sanctioned by Fifa, despite it having been made aware of the majority of them by Fare or through the media.
According to the Fare report, which has been seen by Telegraph Sport, they include “homophobic” chanting by Brazil and Mexico supporters, far-right banners displayed by followers of Germany, Russia and Croatia, racist attacks instigated by England fans and discriminatory costumes and make-up worn by visitors from a number of countries.
Fifa’s disciplinary committee did consider taking action in several of those cases but controversially decided none of them constituted breaches of its rules.

That flew in the face of the “zero-tolerance” approach promised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter and infuriated the head of its own anti-discrimination task force, Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb.
Fifa’s inaction prompted Fare – whose executive director, Piara Powar, is a member of Webb’s task force – to make several recommendations aimed at preventing repeat behaviour at future tournaments.

They include training of disciplinary committee members, who it accused of operating in a way where sanctions “sometimes appear to be applied inconsistently”.
The report adds: “There are incidents that are sanctioned in World Cup qualifiers but similar incidents that take place during the tournament itself are dismissed.”
Webb said last week: “It is obvious there is a disconnect between what we in the task force deems as racism and discrimination and what the disciplinary committee deems as racism and discrimination.”
Fare’s report also urges the training of match-day officials to identify acts of discriminations as they are taking place, as well as the introduction of independent observers at “all international tournaments”.
Webb was particularly vexed that Fifa has not employed such observers in Brazil.

Fare has long supplied them for Uefa competitions, including the last European Championship, at which every reported incident of discrimination was punished.
Observers were also present at matches in last season’s Champions League, where those sanctioned with partial stadium closures included Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.
Powar told Telegraph Sport: “This year’s World Cup has been a wonderful event, everything we imagined it could be. But even in the heady environment of Brazil, there have been incidents of discrimination and hate crimes inside stadiums.

“The incidents we recorded were very real and, in many cases, extremely serious, some perpetrated by far-right groups from Europe and others the result of the ignorance of ordinary fans.
“It is a huge shame that Fifa seem to have turned a blind eye to what is happening.
“We trust that, in future, a system of dealing with these issues will be put in place. Without understanding the reality of the situation, it is impossible to educate and work with people.”
