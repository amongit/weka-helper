UK Anti-Doping calls for tougher rules after British weightlifter George Winston's ban reduced

Winston, 21, was found to have taken two anabolic steroids and a banned hormone when he failed a drug test at the Central and South West Championships in Leamington Spa on Nov 10.
On Monday he was suspended for two years but escaped a ban twice that length by making a full confession.
Under the world anti-doping code, taking multiple banned substances constitutes “aggravated circumstances” and is punishable by a four-year suspension, but the code also allows for the sanction to be reduced to a maximum of two years if athletes own up to their guilt.
The World Anti-Doping Agency is carrying out a consultation before a revised code is published next year, and UKAD chief executive Andy Parkinson wants the loophole closed.
He said: “This case illustrates key issues raised in the ongoing review of the world anti-doping code, notably the automatic benefit of a prompt admission.

“Mr Winston clearly intended to enhance his performance using more than one substance. By promptly admitting that he had committed an anti-doping rule violation, we were unable to seek a four-year ban and were limited to a maximum sanction of two years.
“We do not think that this sends a strong enough message to the sports community and we will continue to press for tougher sanctions for serious dopers in the revised code.”
Winston, who has a background in “strongest man” competitions and had no national ranking in weightlifting, tested positive for the steroids Methandienone and Trenbolone and the cancer drug Tamoxiden, which is used to prevent breast tissue enlargement in men as a result of steroid use.
