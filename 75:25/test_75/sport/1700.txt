Nick Offerman Pumps Up America About NASCAR In Hilarious Super Bowl Ad
NASCAR racing is patriotic, tough-as-nails, meat-on-the-grill fun.
At least, that’s the claim being made by comedian Nick Offerman in this over-the-top NASCAR ad created by NBC Sports.
“Welcome to the place where we speed all day, where we bump and grind in a non-sexual way,” Offerman recites in the clip. “Where scores are settled, and we break the rules, and everybody's got a set of badass tools.”
The ad, which has already been watched more than 900,000 times on YouTube, will make its TV debut during NBC’s coverage of the Super Bowl this weekend. Watch the entire spot in the video above.
