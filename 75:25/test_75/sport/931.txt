Lance Armstrong talks with Usada chief Travis Tygart hailed as a positive step

Jonathan Vaughters, the chief executive of Cannondale-Garmin, has described as “positive” the news that Lance Armstrong has met with the head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency.
Travis Tygart told The Sunday Telegraph last weekend that he was prepared to discuss a possible reduction in the American’s lifetime ban so long as Armstrong provided “substantial assistance”.
That means providing credible evidence to help in any case which is initiated. “He can’t just come in and say ‘Here’s what I did’,” Tygart said.
Armstrong and Tygart met for six hours
Armstrong and Tygart met for six hours, according to The New York Times. “It’s positive news,” said Vaughters, who was speaking at the Tackling Doping in Sport 2015 conference at the Emirates Stadium . “I don’t know what his motivations are, but to me that’s good news. My experiences with Travis have been nothing but positive.”
Vaughters was in London to address the conference on the issue of doping in cycling, which has been in the news again with the release of the Cycling Independent Reform Commission’s 227-page report. The report claimed, among other things, that doping at a lower level – at Masters, youth or amateur levels – was now “becoming endemic”.
“That is one of the truly unfortunate consequences of the doping scandals of the last 20 years,” Vaughters said. “At an amateur level, at a school level... [that they think] that I’m standing there and basically telling you guys a bunch of bulls---, that at the professional level they are all doping and if they say they are not doing it, it is c--- that they are putting out there for their sponsors to keep them happy.
“One of the hardest parts of my job when recruiting first-year professional riders from junior or under-23 ranks, is trying to figure out which of those performances are real and which are doped.”
Meanwhile, Sir Bradley Wiggins has been confirmed for the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire from May 1-3.
But there will be no reprisal of the sprint battle between Mark Cavendish and Marcel Kittel as the Manxman was a notable absentee from the start sheet. Wiggins will lead his newly formed team, WIGGINS, for the first time since leaving Team Sky.
