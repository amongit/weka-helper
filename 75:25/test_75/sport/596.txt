Nicklas Bendtner, Arsenal’s Danish striker, will walk away from the club in the summer leaving behind what he claims is a blatantly inaccurate portrait of his decade in north London.
The forward, who is expected to spearhead Denmark’s attack against England at Wembley on Wednesday night, has fallen behind Olivier Giroud and rookie Yaya Sanogo in the Emirates pecking order and is out of contract in the summer.
He said: “You can never say never in football but I can’t see my career finishing at Arsenal because I want to play. Every footballer wants to play and right now I am sometimes not even in the team, it’s not nice, you want to play every game and I want to be at a team where those possibilities are possible.
“The team has been winning so it has been difficult to change the team. I think there are reasons why and why not but I would rather keep them personal.”
The 26-year-old has been labelled egotistical and arrogant during his time in England; accused of linking himself with Barcelona and Real Madrid and heralding himself as one of the world’s best strikers.

Bendtner admits he made mistakes in his youth but he believes his past misdemeanours should be forgiven and his image correctly broadcast.
“If we talked about all that we could be here for about 20 minutes talking about all the stories made up,” he said “For example; I did an interview with a Danish paper where they asked me ‘if you could play for any club in the world who would it be?’ I said my dream as a boy was to play for Barcelona and if I could play for them then I would be happy. That got translated to ‘I am going to Real Madrid or Barcelona in the January transfer window’.
“I am still reading things like that and it is very frustrating. If you want to be playing for a club like that then you need to be scoring 30 goals a season and I am not doing that so I don’t understand why people misunderstand things like that. It’s very frustrating for me and it’s annoying.
“You try to project an image of yourself and it gets misunderstood and things are written about you that aren’t true.
“I was a bit hot-headed when I was younger maybe, but that’s part of life. You grow up and you expect people to grow up with you and see that. And when they don’t do that and they still try to knock you for things and print stories that are not true, or happened a long time ago, then it’s frustrating and you get upset.
“When it is time to talk about my whole Arsenal career I think I will do it when I have left, not at this moment.”
Bendtner also took a swipe at England supporters’ expectations. “Sometimes it is funny to read that you think you should win every game 5-0 because football isn’t like that,” he said. “I think that England has great potential and maybe that is why there are such high expectations.”
