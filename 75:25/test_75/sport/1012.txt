London 2012 Olympics: Fans give Earl's Court roof a workout but Team GB men's volleyball team fall short

Every national body is mindful of the unprecedented exposure of a home Olympics and all are searching for the breakthrough from periphery to mainstream that cycling has achieved over this past decade.
On the evidence of a weekend of firsts in British Olympic history, few have a better chance than volleyball. At 9am on Sunday morning, 15,000 inquisitive but largely unconvinced spectators had respectfully filed into Earls Court for the Olympic debut of a men’s volleyball team.
By 10.30am, they resembled a raucous football crowd after being whipped up in to a frenzy of excitement both by the off-court entertainment, complete with cheerleaders, but also what was happening on the court.
Team GB, who are nestled between the Maldives and Haiti at 92nd place in the world rankings, were actually within a point of taking a set off Bulgaria, world ranked No9 and previous Olympic medallists. It did not quite happen but, in that moment, any debate about the sense of fielding a volleyball team in these Olympics evaporated.
Team GB might have lost 3-0 but there was respectability both in their performance and a final scoreline of 25-18, 25-20, 26-24.

“The whole team played to a level that has never been seen before in Britain,” said Ben Pipes, the captain. “There were goose-bumps. We feel like we have been digging in the dark, in a tunnel for five years, and today we saw a light. It was just incredible.
“Volleyball was the second highest broadcast sport in the last Olympics. It is huge across Europe. The rest of the world has fallen in love with it and we are trying to crack it in Britain. We hope, as a team, we have planted a flag.”
Judging by the utterly spontaneous enthusiasm on Sunday of a crowd who knew little about volleyball, there is a genuine opportunity. It is certainly curious that the sport has never made greater inroads in this country.
Volleyball is played by 240 nations globally, making it the world’s third biggest by national governing bodies. It is also certain to take centre-stage at the next Olympics in Rio de Janiero where the drums and other musical instruments (banned at Earls Court) are certain to be out in force.
Across great swathes of continental Europe, volleyball is also as much a part of the fabric of national life as football here. In Holland, where Pipes and many of his Britain team-mates are now based, most villages even have a fully functioning club with mixed teams ranging from small children to pensioners.
The absence of any comparable structure in Britain has had an obvious knock-on at elite level but Sunday was still the culmination of an extraordinary improvement over the last five years.
It began when Kenny Barton, who is the team leader in London both for beach and indoor volleyball, took Britain’s best players to a converted factory unit in Holland and based them there so that they could compete together in a major league.
“To get here from there is phenomenal but the real aim is Rio and actually qualifying ourselves,” said Barton. “Bulgaria would have wiped us off the court a few years ago. To stand on the court today was a dream for us but we have still got a huge way to go.”
One big hurdle to overcome was the decision by UK Sport in 2009 to cut their funding by almost half. The rationale was that those sports with a genuine medal chance should be the priority. The British team cannot now even afford the entrance fee for the European Volleyball League and they have had only five warm-up matches in their preparations for these Olympics. Yet their performances, both on Sunday and in the test event where they beat Egypt and Mexico (ranked 12th and 23rd in the world respectively), suggests that there is genuine potential.
“It was the first time we have played Britain since 1995 and I was quite surprised by their level — we should congratulate them,” said Vladimir Nikolov, the Bulgaria captain.
Pipes, Mark Plotyczer and Oluwadamilola Bakare particularly shone on Sunday. The team are also young and, in its composition, there can be no legitimate accusations of any so-called ‘plastic Brits’.
They do, however, have a foreign coach in Dutchman Harry Brokking. “We fulfilled what we wanted to do,” he said. “We are not here just to participate, we are here to show that we can compete at the top.
"This tournament must not be an end but a beginning. Britain is considered one of the top sports nations and we should be present in one of the biggest team sports in the world.”
Olympic events the British would have a great chance in By Thom Gibbs
Quizzes Brits adore trivia and hours spent in pubs desperately trying to remember the fifth tube station with “and” in its name would pay off handsomely. (It’s Chalftont and Latimer, by the way).
Sarcasm The lowest form of wit, but one that has been perfected to the highest possible levels over centuries of very British pithiness. Yet to be professionalised, so perfect for the Games.
Stoicism No-one does stuffing all their feelings into an angry little ball like Britain. No gauche shows of emotion for us. Instead we’ll have a stiff upper lip and a glorious mid-life crisis.
Queuing An undisputed gold medal waiting to happen. We’ll queue for anything and we’ll bloody well like it. Would also allow audience members to queue to watch queuing. Bliss.
Competitive opening ceremony-arranging Danny Boyle has raised the bar. There has even been talk of strangers striking up conversations about it. On the tube. That’s likely to remain the biggest achievement of these Games.
