Super-flyweight Paul Butler can become the first Briton for more than 100 years to step down a weight and win a second world title on Friday night if he beats champion Zolani Tete, revealing that his motivation is using his pay-day to secure a seat for Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao on May 2, where the cheapest seats in the MGM Grand Garden Arena are expected to go for £5,000.
Butler can become the first British boxer since Bob Fitzsimmons – who won middleweight, heavyweight and then in 1902, the light heavyweight championship – by defeating Tete, the International Boxing Federation super-flyweight champion, at the Liverpool Echo Arena.
South African Tete – record 19-3 – has a five-inch height and reach advantage over the Ellesmere Port fighter, who is unbeaten in 17 contests, and has speed and movement plus blistering hand speed as his major weapons.
Butler stepped up a weight to win the IBF bantamweight crown from fellow British fighter Stuey Hall, but it is at 8st 3lb where he can make his speed and body punching felt.
“It’s all about securing my future and putting my money into properties, and things like that,” Butler said. “You can’t lose your money by doing that. But I’ve booked my flight and my hotel to Las Vegas already for May 2, and getting a ticket is the next step. I’m a huge fan of these two fighters, and Mayweather versus Pacquiao is the biggest fight in our lifetimes. As soon as those tickets come out, I want to be there. I’m sure I’ll pay over the odds for a ticket, but it’s worth doing.”

How richest-ever fight was made
Butler, 26, who was an aspiring footballer invited to join the Liverpool Academy until boxing took over his life, has been a student of the Noble Art for many years, and it shows in his skill levels. “I had the option to play football but I chose boxing instead. They don’t let you do another sport, so I had to choose. I stuck with boxing.”
“I still play now on a Saturday and a Sunday. I’m a striker or a left winger, but mostly a striker. I stay on the last defender and beat them for pace and put the ball in the net. I’m a left footer. I’m left footed and left handed. You wouldn’t think that with me being an orthodox boxer, but everything I do is with my left.”
“A lot of my stoppages have come with a left hook to the body. Marco Antonio Barrera, the great Mexican boxer, was the same, a left-handed orthodox fighter. I’ve watched him since I was a kid and that’s where that left hook has come from. I’ve thrown it since I was 11.”
Butler has modelled himself on the best out there, under Arnie Farnell. “I work very hard in the gym and I’ve studied a lot of great fighters over the years, the likes of Marco Antonio Barrera and Johnny Tapia. I’ve watched plenty of them. You pick up little things and then you work on them in the gym with Arnie.”
“Arnie is a diehard student of boxing so he’s constantly watching tapes.
With each fight you see something different with me. Against the Mexican about a year-and-a-half ago, you saw me on the back foot, like a Mayweather style, on the ropes, countering.”
“Then, against Stuey Hall, you saw two sides to me. You saw me standing in the centre of the ring, defending from the centre of the ring, picking my shots well, and then in the second half of the fight, because of his natural size, you saw me go on the back foot and win the fight on the back foot. There are loads of sides to me. You’ll definitely see a new side to me against Tete.”
Butler knows he must be at his best against a much taller, angular man.
“You’re going to have to see the best of me defensively and in terms of footwork and movement. My foot movement has got to be ’bang on’ come fight night. My head movement has got to to be good as well. I’ll also need to find good angles from where I can pick good shots. You’ll see all of that on Friday night.”
One thing which never changes in boxing is that the bigger men get bigger coverage in the media. That’s not lost on Butler. “It sort of bothers me. If I was in a division above middleweight, I’d be known by everyone in the country. But because I’m down at super flyweight, and I’ve won a world title at bantamweight, there aren’t many people, other than the boxing fans, who really know me.”
That can change on Friday. “I’m aware of the history, Fitzsimmons and all that but it will be in the back of my mind. The performance and the win are the most important things for me. I just want to go in there and get the job done. Making history is just a nice bonus.
Then I’ll get that seat at Mayweather-Pacquiao sorted.”
Zolani Tete v Paul Butler for the IBF super-flyweight title is live on BoxNation TV on Friday night.
