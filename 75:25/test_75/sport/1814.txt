Olympic Gymnastics Recreated In LEGO Form: Watch The Fab Five Win Gold (VIDEO)
The U.S. Women's Gymnastics Team is pretty flexible, as one viral video proved. But even when rendered in stiff LEGO form, the Fab Five still manages to dominate at the Olympics and earn Team USA a gold medal.
The Guardian recreated the highlights of last week's Olympic gymnastics team competition -- entirely in plastic. Between McKayla Maroney's jaw-droppingly flawless performance on vault to the Russian team's stunning routines on bars, the competition was tight. But Team USA pulled ahead, clinching the gold medal with a score of 183.596 points; Team Russia lagged more than five points behind. Watch as the Americans win gold, LEGO-style!
LEGOs have proved surprisingly versatile art form -- check out the slideshow below for some amazing creations.
