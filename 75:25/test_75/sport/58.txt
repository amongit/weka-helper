Dolphins re-sign safety Delmas and backup QB Moore
DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Safety Louis Delmas is back with the Miami Dolphins, which means he'll be reunited with former teammate Ndamukong Suh.
Delmas, who is recovering from a knee injury, signed a one-year deal Friday to stay with the Dolphins. Last week Miami signed All-Pro defensive tackle Suh to a $114 million, six-year contract.
Suh played with Delmas in Detroit in 2010-13.
''We're definitely going to have fun,'' Delmas said. ''That's one guy right there that can basically run a whole defense by himself. He has great enthusiasm, great energy to the ball and he's a vicious player when it comes time to get to the ball. He creates havoc when he gets there. I'm definitely excited to be reunited with him.''
The Dolphins also re-signed backup quarterback Matt Moore and reserve running back LaMichael James to one-year contracts Friday.
Moore has been with the Dolphins since 2011, when he replaced an injured Chad Henne, started 12 games and was voted the team's most valuable player. But Ryan Tannehill has started all 48 games in his three NFL seasons, and Moore threw only four passes last year.
Delmas joined the Dolphins in 2014.
''Louis was a quality addition to Miami last season who added energy and playmaking ability from the safety position,'' general manager Dennis Hickey said in a statement. ''Matt has provided stability and leadership for the Dolphins in his time here, and we're excited to have both of them back.''
Delmas has been a starter since his rookie year with the Lions in 2009, but has played an entire season only once. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee last year, missed the final three games and might not be available for the start of training camp.
However, he said his recovery has gone well.
''The knee is great,'' Delmas said. ''I definitely know that I'll be ready for the first game of the season.''
Delmas was born in Florida and played at North Miami Beach High School. He joined the Dolphins in 2014 and said staying at home was factor in his decision to re-sign with them.
''My heart wanted to stay in Miami,'' he said. ''Every child growing up in Miami always wants to play for their hometown.''
