Lewis Hamilton pulled off an emphatic BBC Sports Personality of the Year triumph that surprised even himself.
The Englishman claimed a third of the vote weeks after clinching his second Formula One world title.
The 29-year-old had twice been runner-up for the BBC prize and looked to be heading for a hat-trick of near-misses with Rory McIlroy, the Northern Irishman who won two golf majors in 2014, a clear favourite.
But Hamilton took 209,920 votes with McIlroy second on 123,745.
Hamilton said: "I'm so proud and honoured to be among so much British sporting talent. A massive thank you to all the people that called in, I really was not expecting it - because dude (McIlroy), you had such an incredible year. I never thought I would be up here standing with the greats. It's just a dream."
