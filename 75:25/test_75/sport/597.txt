Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have both praised the performances of Luke Shaw as the Southampton full-back looks set to make his England debut against Denmark on Wednesday night.
The 18-year-old has been named alongside Ashley Cole and Leighton Baines as manager Roy Hodgson evaluates his options at left-back ahead of naming his World Cup squad on May 13.
Shaw, who alongside Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and Rickie Lambert makes up a quartet of Southampton players in Hodgson's 30-man squad for Wednesday's meeting with Denmark, has enjoyed an impressive season so far and Lallana admits it came as no surprise to see his club-mate named in the senior set-up.
"I'm not surprised at all," he said. "He has been an outstanding for us all season. He looks like a seasoned pro and it was no surpise to see he was included in the squad.
"There are two outstanding players ahead of him but he will keep his feet on the ground.

"He knows he is going to learn off them and if he watches them closely in training he knows it is going to do him good.
"It was massive news not just for himself but for his family.
"I know his family well from being at the club, it was a very proud moment for him."
Meanwhile Oxlade-Chamberlain, a product of the Southampton academy himself and another man who made his England debut at 18, has hailed Shaw's form.
"I think he has been absolutely outstanding," he said.
"The maturity he has been playing with and the consistency level has been unbelievable.
"He shot up and has matured and grown physically, he has taken that into the first team at Southampton and it has been a rapid rise for him but he has handled it really well. It is really good to see him here."
Oxlade-Chamberlain travelled with England to Ukraine and Poland for Euro 2012 as a young player and admits the experience will help him in the future.
"For me, going to the Euros was a massive experience and it almost came as a surprise to see my name selected for that," he added.
"It gave me the pedestal to push on with my Arsenal and England career. Seeing how Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney handled themselves at a major tournament was great experience for me."
Shaw's involvement means it is the first England squad ever named to contain four Southampton players as Lallana, Lambert and Rodriguez look to add to their caps since breaking into the international fold over the past 12 months.
Lambert was the first of the quartet to break into Hodgson's squad and Lallana revealed the striker's inclusion gave Southampton's other English talent renewed hope of making the grade.
"Seeing Rickie being involved gave everyone an extra 10 per cent of belief," he said.
"We have had a good season at Southampton, been performing well on a consistent basis and we have all been helping each oter.
"It is brilliant, it proves how far the club has come and to have four lads representing the country this week is fantastic."
