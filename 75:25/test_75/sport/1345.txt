USA earn stay of execution against Great Britain in Davis Cup

The celebrations on the Clyde will have to wait a little longer, after the world's top-ranked doubles players Bob and Mike Bryan battled through another thrilling five-set epic to earn the USA their first point of the weekend's Davis Cup tie in Glasgow.
In all probability, though, the Americans' 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 9-7 victory over Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot has only earned them a stay of execution. The history books say that Great Britain have played 239 previous matches in this venerable competition, and have never squandered a 2-0 lead like the one they claimed in such dramatic style on Friday.
After the five-hour slugfest that night between John Isner and the indomitable James Ward, it is hard to see how Isner - who described his five-set defeat as "brutal - I'll barely get to sleep" - can come back to challenge Andy Murray in Sunday's opening rubber, particularly given that Murray Jnr did not have to exert himself too much on the doubles court on Saturday.
But the American captain Jim Courier was naturally looking for positives last night in his team's spirited display. "There was probably some hope in the GB camp that they might close it out today [Saturday]," he said. "Maybe they spent some energy, some emotion. Now they have to suit up and be ready for battle tomorrow."
By omitting Andy Murray, Smith was returning to the script that worked so well against the same opponents in San Diego last year. The ploy perhaps sacrificed Great Britain's best chance of upsetting the Bryans, because Murray - like all great tennis champions - is lethal in either format of the game.

But why risk the possibility of an injury, or another draining match that would leave him feeling tired and sluggish on Sunday morning? If he comes out with the same sort of intensity and purpose that he showed in the first 45 minutesagainst American No. 2 Donald Young on Friday, there can only be one winner against a demoralised Isner on Sunday. The unexpected twists in this tie have thus ruled out the possibility of the first doubles meeting between two sets of brothers in the history of the Davis Cup's world group. But there was no sense of disappointment among the 7,700 fans in the Emirates Arena as Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot walked out to a rousing chorus of the song that has become the unofficial anthem of this whole weekend: The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond.

The trouble with going up against the Bryan twins is that you can never match them for synchronisation. Born to a pair of tennis coaches, these boys learned to poach at the net almost before they could walk. Inglot and Murray might have been practicing together all week - impressively, they were still hitting balls and rallying on the main court at around 10pm on Friday evening in Glasgow - but their actual match experience as a duo before yesterday was limited to three junior tournaments when each of them were in their mid-teens.
As the soon as the first lobs went up, there was a lot of "My ball!" going on from the Brits. It wouldn't be true to say that the Bryans communicate only by telepathy, for they do also bark at each other during the rallies, but their many years of experience give them a unique sense of symbiosis.
For a scratch pairing to come so close to beating these 16-time grand-slam champions was still a superb effort. This was Inglot's second crack at Davis Cup competition, and both were against the Bryans - which must count as one of the toughest introductions to the event you could imagine. But his whole mien was completely different to what we saw a year ago in San Diego, where he began the match with a pair of double-faults.
This time, Inglot - a citizen of the world who has a Polish father, a degree from the University of Virginia, and a perfect home counties accent - was the strong man of the partnership for most of the match. He powered down his huge serve - the biggest in the doubles world, according to Bob Bryan - with such accuracy and venom that he was not broken once in this entire 3hr 39min contest.
It was a different story for Murray, who dropped his first four service games to put the British team on the back foot early. After two sets, he must have wished he had been on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond for real; he might even have thrown himself in the water.
But huge credit to him for regathering his composure and raising his game from that moment on. Over the rest of the match, he performed multiple miracles at the net, where his wingspan and hair-trigger reactions prompted the watching Brad Gilbert - his brother's former coach - to dub him "Stretch Murray" on Twitter.
If the only break in the deciding set was also against Murray's serve, it was hardly his fault: Inglot just happened to miss several volleys in a row. Even so, there was no disgrace in losing to a partnership who have never been beaten after winning the first two sets. And it was hard to fault the tennis or the commitment on either side in a match which superbly showcased the entertainment value of doubles.
"We played a great match because those guys didn't give us an inch all day," said Bob Bryan, who admitted that he had been scarred by a pair of five-set defeats in Davis Cup competition in 2013. "We were telling each other, 'Let's erase all that pain.' The best way to do it was to win a very emotional match like that."
