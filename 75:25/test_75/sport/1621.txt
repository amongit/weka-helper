Regis Philbin Planning To Host A Sports Talk Show?
Regis Philbin is in talks to host a new ensemble daytime talk show with Fox Sports, according to Sports Business Daily.
Like Barbara Walters on ABC daytime talk show "The View," Philbin is in talks to become a part-time host. Since Philbin left "Live!" in November 2011, he has appeared on TV Land's "Hot In Cleveland," and become a regular on Rachel Ray's daytime talk show. He also filled in for the" Today" show's Hoda Kotb, reuniting with his former co-host Kathie Lee Gifford.
Philbin was clear when he left "Live!" that he was not retiring. When news broke that Meredith Vieira was leaving "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire," Philbin was asked if he would return to his former role. The New York Post reported that Philbin was considering returning to the gig, but said there were some scheduling issues. "I get up late now. And I love lounging around," he said.
