BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth completed this year’s London Marathon in under four hours, but was “slower than expected” – thanks to a “most surreal moment” during the race.
During her final mile, not far from the finish line on the Mall in St James’s Park, Raworth says she was pulled up by a race official. The steward “stopped me and accused me of having a fake race number… I didn’t. I finally had to push past her!”

Despite the altercation, Raworth, 45, finished in a very respectable time of 3 hours, 48 minutes, two seconds. “I went off too fast,” she admits ruefully, “and paid for it.”
At least she completed the 26-mile circuit. Three years ago, she was left unconscious after collapsing two miles from the finish.
