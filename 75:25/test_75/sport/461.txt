Ogier's maiden title, which he secured for Volkswagen in their first full season in the sport, ensures that next month's season-finale in Wales will have even less riding on it than usual.
Interest in the WRC in this country has been in steep decline since the glory days of Colin McRae and Richard Burns in the late 1990s and early 2000s - the lack of a British star to rally behind hitting the sport hard.
Television coverage has dwindled and Wales Rally GB - the latest incarnation of what is essentially the Rally of Britain - now attracts little mainstream interest.
This year's event takes place on the same weekend as the Formula One grand prix in Austin, Texas, ensuring that the focus of motorsport media will lie elsewhere.
None of which mattered much to Ogier who was understandably thrilled to have wrapped up his maiden title, even if it was by default.

Dani Sordo's victory on the opening power stage around the streets of Strasbourg ensured that Neuville, who needed to win the stage and the rally, could not keep the title race alive.
"I'm so happy," said Ogier, who becomes the first man other than Loeb to win the world title since Petter Solberg in 2003. "Before the stage I was a bit confused about whether it would happen, but we're here and we managed to do it.
"I am absolutely overjoyed. I could give everyone in the world a big hug. The feeling is impossible to describe. To have won the world championship in France is an absolute dream come true.
"For the last few days I have been trying not to think too much about it, in order to avoid making any mistakes. The relief now is immense."
With his former Citroen team mate Loeb in semi-retirement, Ogier has won six of 10 rallies this year, finishing second in two more.
"As a little boy, I used to marvel at the cars and top drivers at Rallye Monte-Carlo with my father in my home town of Gap - and now Julien [Ingrassia, his co-driver] and I are world rally champions. It is crazy," he said.
"This success would never have been possible without our fantastic team at Volkswagen. Whether trucker, mechanic or race engineer, I have to thank everyone. One thing is for sure - we will celebrate in style now."
