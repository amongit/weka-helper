17.01 That's all from today's live-blog folks.
Just to re-cap, England have carried out their first training session in Rio today, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was seen doing some light jogging. Captain Steven Gerrard played a limited part in the 30 degree heat however.
I'll be back tomorrow, when we'll be one whole day closer to the World Cup actually happening, and therefore, this blog can only get much much better.
See you all then. TTFN.
16.52 Jeremy Paxman recently railed on poetry to "raise its game." And it seems poetry has responded to Paxo's rallying cry. Well, someone at the BBC anyway, who have commissioned the England 'World Cup poem' for 2014.
Called 'That Time Again', the poem was written and filmed by poet Henry Birtles. Its accompanying video features England heroes such as Hugh Grant, Liz Hurley and that bloke from the Inspector Lynley Mysteries all reading some verse.
You can watch the whole thing on the Beeb's website.
16.43 Earlier we bought you a picture of the Mexican players looking pretty chuffed while they headed off to their training camp (15.45). Well, we may well have cursed that.
Our World Cup Nations reporter Martha Guerra reports that the team's coach has subsequently broken down and the players are having to take taxis to their camp. Which should be fine, because there's probably not that much traffic or anything.
The episode also rather makes a mockery of this piece of statistical analysis: 'Mexico: the World Cup's Luckiest Country.'
16.34 England's training's pretty much complete, and Steven Gerrard took a limited part in the session after he came off at half-time during the Honduras game to protect a groin-strain.
16.19 In other training news, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been seen jogging in a leg-brace, but not warming up with the rest of the squad.
16.15 Thanks Rob. I'm back in the chair, and England's training session in the impossibly picturesque Urca base is well under-way.
Here's a snap of Roy Hodgson limbering up:

And here, co-opting an unconventional sun-guard:

And finally pulling his 'Rooney face' at Luke Shaw or Adam Lallana (we can't really tell which)

15.58 And now Mehreen has returned, I'll bow out and hand back to her. Bye.
15.57 Henry Winter has been to England training and sends this video dispatch for our delectation.

15.55 Here are some form guides from the friendlies of the teams (excluding England) attracting the most money in the market. and news of groin strains knocked together by Rob Bagchi earlier.
15.45 Martha Guerra our World Cup Nation Mexico correspondent sends us this photograph from the team bus. It's Miguel Layun And Francisco Maza Rodriguez, doing the V for victory presumably, rather than the V for "do one".

15.30 The Monty Python team have released a version of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (with a dead man in goal!?) to help England gans get over what they seem to be suggesting is inevitable disappointment.

Personally I still prefer this

15.10 This is Rob Bagchi, filling in briefly for Mehreen. I prefer Traffic talk (Every Mother's Son being in an all-time top 10) to traffic talk but it seems the state of congestion in Brazil is rapidly becoming a hot topic.
<noframe>Twitter: Henry Winter - Traffic news: despite concerns about congestion, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23eng" target="_blank">#eng</a> bus took only 31 minutes from their Royal Tulip hotel in Sao Conrado to Urca training</noframe>
15.00

England have arrived at their Urca military training base in Brazil. We'll be bringing you the latest from their first training session later in the hour.
14.37 The Project Babb team have made a Venn diagram accurately summing up the World Cup hopes of all 32 teams in Brazil.
It's 100% completely correct to no decimal places.

Check out the full thing here.
14.23 Colombia are heading off to Brazil today. Our World Cup Nations watcher Juan Arango has snapped star midfielder James Rodriguez (J-Rod?) showing the fans and the press some love at the team's send-off.


14.10 Travel latest from Brazil: no it's nothing as gloomy as airport queues, metro strikes or gridlock in Sao Paulo, but just the news that the intrepid Dutch fan bus, a stalwart of four campaigns has made it safe and sound to Rio. Phew.
Hat-tip to bus-watching Henry Winter for the news.

13.49

Look at Roy Hodgson. Just look at him, he's scratching his head wondering who he will pick to start against Italy.
You can help him out, or at least have your own head-scratching-staring-in-to-the-distance-pensively moment, playing with our nifty England Squad Selector.
You can pick your team and formation and compare it to Roy's eventual XI, or just mess around and theorise about how well Fraser Forster could do on the wing.
13.29: Bosnia & Herzegovina have barely landed in Brazil, but have already proceeded to charm the socks off the natives...using scarfs and other miscellaneous team paraphernalia.
The Bosnian equivalent of Greg Dyke and the team coach handed out hat and scarves to local Brazilian policemen guarding their hotel.
Personally, I've always loved Bosnia ever since I got them in the 'Who are you secretly supporting at the World Cup' quiz last week.
You can watch the full video over at Project Babb.

13.15 Even elephants are being forced to take part in World Cup jollyness, despite the fact that the nearest of them will be about 4830 miles away from Brazil.
But hey, a here's Thai elephant turning Spanish for the next month because Thailand didn't qualify.

More wacky World Cup pics in our gallery
12.58 An update from our Swiss World Cup Nations watcher, Paul Knott, where tournament fever is reaching ridiculous and quite un-Swiss proportions:
"You can tell that the Swiss fancy their team's chances of doing well in this World Cup because the press coverage has reached levels usually reserved for sportsmen who slide down mountains for a living.
"The team chef has been interviewed by almost every publication in the country ("lots of pasta and no Brazilian feijoada until after they get knocked out"). The pilot selected to fly them to Brazil was also quoted extensively before departure. He reassured a worried nation that he has previously carried the Pope and Sophia Loren without mishap.
"The Swiss Tourist Board are using their national team's presence to increase awareness in Brazil about Switzerland opening a "Swiss House" for the tournament which certainly suggests that no-one is over-estimating what the average Brazilian knows about Switzerland. It contains a giant sledge, some model cows and assorted chocolate doodads. No cuckoo clocks though - as everyone knows, those are actually Bavarian.
"Perhaps less on message was midfielder Granit Xhaka. On being told that the German squad's wives and girlfriends were staying in the same hotel as the Swiss team, he grinned wolfishly, promised to take good care of them and all but twirled an imaginary handlebar moustache. The spirit of Terry-Thomas is alive, well and living inside a 21 year-old from Basel".
Here's that promotional video featuring lots of Brazilians mis-prounouncing 'Switzerland':

12.34 Some heat acclimatisation tips for Roy's Boys from Abu-Zar Aziz in balmy Glasgow:
"Just won our inaugural company 5-aside football tournament on Friday in stifling conditions. Only pressing the opposition in our half and a quick counter was the key to success."
12.20 Arjen Robben had his customary before-every-game injury scare training with the Dutch team yesterday.
The man who was previously made of glass, but now is just a bit more like cardboard, took umbrage at being tackled by team-mate Bruno Martins Indi.

Robben rolled around a bit, did some gesticulating, but should be fine. If you want more, Project Babb is keeping an eye on this progress.
12.01 One for the England naysayers now. Here's three minutes of the Three Lions most fabled moment glorious technicolour.

This footage of the 1966 final features 93,000 Wembley spectators, a youthful Queen and Prince Phillip, and a sobbing Bobby Charlton who doesn't really look that different at all now.
Watch it and weep everyone.
11.35 World Cup wallcharts that are tacked over your bed and require filling in with a pen, are old hat.
Based on this piece of wisdom, we've come up with a shiny techy internet version which allows you to play your way through the tournament by predicting the scores.
It's quite wonderful so come and have a go HERE. Please and thank you.
11.15 Neymar's a good-egg isn't he? The Brazilian striker was training with the national team when a young spectator ran onto the field yesterday.
Proving that sometimes life can be just like a Nike ad, Neymar let the diminutive pitch-invader on, get some pictures with the rest of the team and even have a bit of a kick-about. Lovely.
<noframe>Twitter: SeleÃ§Ã£o Brasileira - Kid invaded Brazil training. Security came, but Neymar didn't let them take him. He then took a pic with him. GRANDE! <a href="http://t.co/ROtug3NImE" target="_blank">http://t.co/ROtug3NImE</a></noframe>

10.47 The Lampard Or Gerrard controversy rumbles on, this time stoked by a Honduran journalist who had the temerity to refer to Stevie G as 'Mr Frank.'
Project Babb has the latest on all the fall-out
10.33 Getting Americans to genuinely like and care about football soccer is the holy grail for the commercial bods who run the game.
Car-makers Kia have been doing their best for the fight by enlisting the help of Brazilian model Adriana Lima to go into the homes of some baseball-loving yanks and re-arranging their furniture, which should definitely work.
Hat-tip to Aussie footie watcher James Clark for that (@Clarkies2340).

10.18 Opposition watch: Italy won their first game in eight last night, beating Brazilian side Fluminense 5-3.
The deceptively named Ciro Immobile (Eee-moby-ley) scored a hat-trick and set up another. Lorenzo Insigne also got a couple for Prandelli's men in what looked like a bit of belter as far as pre-World Cup run-outs go.

So after being distinctly average for the last few months, the Azzuri look like they're building up a nice head of steam before opening against England on Thursday. Marvellous.
10.02: In more opening ceremony japes, the first kick of the curtain-raiser will be carried out by a paraplegic wearing a robotic bodysuit, a la Iron Man.
The suit, which is controlled by signals from the brain, was designed to enable paralysis victims to walk. The identity of the kicker has not yet been revealed, but the use of a futuristic exoskeleton is exactly how fans at Uruguay 1930 probably expected it this year's tournament to be kicked-off.
Well done, everyone.

09.40 Some sad news about the first major casualty of the World Cup opening ceremony. According to FIFA officials, Jennifer Lopez will not be peforming at the curtain-raiser because of unspecified "production issues."
Because they're unspecified, we can't really tell you anything else. But the other artists to feature in the official tournament song, rapper Pitbull and Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte, will be there to belt out their track "We Are One" on Thursday night. Thank God.
The song has attracted some complaints from Brazilians for sounding "too generic for the nation's Bossa Nova-crazed audiences" and not featuring enough lyrics in Portuguese, according to AP.
In terms of problems with the song, those wouldn't necessarily be top of my list. Anyway, judge for yourselves...

09.10 Good morning folks. Hello and welcome to day-one of the Telegraph's World Cup live-blog.
I'll be scouring the interweb to bring you all the latest from the pre-tournament shenanigans, much of which is likely to consist of more analysis friendly performances, injury scares, actual injuries, lots of training sessions and a phalanx of photo-opportunies across assorted spots in Brazil.
England have arrived in Rio and are due to visit Rochina, the biggest favela in the country later today.
More importantly, the official team portraits have also been released and here's an inspiring shot of the man all eyes will be upon...
