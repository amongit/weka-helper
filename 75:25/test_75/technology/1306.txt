Google pushes out Android 5.1 with extra device protection

While most of the tech world is buzzing about Apple Watch today, Google has some mobile news of its own.
Six licks of Google's Android Lollipop
The Internet giant pushed out an upgraded version of Android Lollipop on Monday.
Version 5.1 doesn't bring a colossal wave of changes. As described by Android Platform vice president Dave Burke in a blog post, most of the new features are just meant to "get more out of your Android phone and tablet."
For example, the addition of High Definition voice calling promises "crystal clear calling" between compatible Android 5.1 devices, such as Google's Nexus 6 smartphone.
Users can also now install more than one SIM card on a device sporting multiple SIM slots, which could help managing monthly mobile costs among family and friends.
Finally, Google is giving Lollipop an extra layer of security with Device Protection. The new setting ensures a lost or stolen device will remain locked until the owner signs in with his or her Google account -- even if someone else tries to reset the device to factory settings.
A new default on the Nexus 6 smartphone and Nexus 9 tablet, Google promised Device Protection will now be installed at time of shipment on most Android phones and tablets running Android 5.1 too.
Android Lollipop version 5.1 is rolling out today over the air.
