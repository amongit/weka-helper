Estonians have gone to the polls although many of them did not actually visit a polling station to cast their ballot last week.
The Baltic state has internet voting (I-Voting), one of the many ways its people interact with the government online. Even the cabinet is paperless as ministers work on tablet computers.
In a Politics Europe film from Tallinn, Adam Fleming spoke to Priit Vinkel of the National Electoral Committee, Enterprise Estonia ICT Representative Karli Suvisild, Jobbatical.com founder Karoli Hindriks and to government IT advisor Siim Sikkut.
