Six Clicks: Top iOS apps of the month, November 2014

As business goes global, sometimes language barriers have to be overcome on a daily basis. This app claims to translate between typing in your native language and your required language automatically -- whether you need to send a text message or email. Currently, translation in to 44 languages and translating from 32 different languages are supported. Having experimented in Spanish, the translation isn't too bad at all, but there is some room for improvement.
Price: £1.49 ($2.33)
Download: App Store

PDF PROvider is a new .PDF file organizer for mobile devices. Not only can you organize files on your mobile device, but you can merge several documents -- including different formats -- into this file type, save photos in the .PDF format, and save webpages in the same way.
Price: £5.99 ($9)
Download: App Store

When you're in business, free time can sometimes be precious and hard to come by. To help you make the most of these moments, Timista aims to give you events, restaurants recommendations and leisure activities in real time, so you never miss out.

SlideShare Presentations, a LinkedIn app, gives users access to over 15 million presentations, infographics and videos on a variety of topics to keep you up-to-date in your professional field. If you don't have time to watch everything you're interested in, you can save the presentations to watch offline.
Price: $Free

Inside is one of the newest players on the news feed front. Rather than throwing article links at you, Inside's team summarise news 'updates' for you in topics that you wish to follow. I have a number of news-related apps on my devices, but this is somewhat addictive.
Price: $Free
Download: App Store

One for music and video fans, Opinion is a quick and easy way to edit audio and clips in order to create podcasts. After playing around with this app, I found navigation and editing itself is very user-friendly and the design is relatively clean. You can also share your podcasts across Soundcloud, iMessage and e-mail.
Price: $Free (in-app purchases)
