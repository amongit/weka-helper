Serena Williams - One. Serena Williams's tennis racket - Nil.
The world No 1 is well known for her fierce temper and it was her racket that felt the full force during her WTA Finals semi-final match against Caroline Wozniacki on Saturday.
Finding the net with a routine backhand to go 5-2 down in the opening set against her Danish rival, Williams decided to release the tension by thundering her racket into the ground.
Over and over and over again.
By the end of her little tantrum there was little left in her hand to resemble what had once been her subservient racket. Poor thing.

It seemed to work though, with Willliams bouncing back to win 2-6, 6-3, 7-6.
