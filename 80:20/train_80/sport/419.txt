Lloris started for France in the friendly against Italy on Wednesday but American Brad Friedel is expected to retain his Premier League place for Tottenham in the north London derby against Arsenal on Saturday.
Andre Villas-Boas has been selecting Lloris in the Europa League but, with no matches in that competition between Christmas and the middle of February, his opportunities are likely to become even more limited.
Lloris has so far kept quiet about the situation, although was understood to be extremely disappointed to lose his place after a clean sheet in the 2-0 victory against Aston Villa and is expected to seek further reassurance from Villas-Boas about the situation. There has also been a terse media exchange between Deschamps and Villas-Boas.
“He doesn’t play enough at his club and it doesn’t sit very well with him,” Deschamps said. “His situation is difficult, burdensome, not ideal.
“Returning to the bench after the performance he made with us in Spain is not easy. He cannot be satisfied playing only one game out of two or three.”

The France manager added: “Of course, he would like to play more. He is getting on with it as best he possibly can but obviously he would like to play more.”
Lloris signed a four-year contract at Tottenham in August after signing from Lyon.
