Neymar To Barcelona? Josep Maria Bartomeu Wants Brazil Soccer Star After London Olympics
By Livio Caferoglu, Goal.com Barcelona vice president Josep Maria Bartomeu has hinted at a summer move for Neymar, declaring that he hopes the striker joins the club after the conclusion of the Olympic Games.
Catalunya has repeatedly been suggested as the likeliest destination for the Santos forward, who is currently away on international duty with Brazil in the quest for a gold medal at London 2012.
The Blaugrana supremo has now confirmed the side's interest in the 20-year-old and admitted that, in an ideal world, Neymar would arrive at Camp Nou after the summer showpiece event.
