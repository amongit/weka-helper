Cameras focused on the female supporter after Mario Balotelli scored a second goal against the Germans to take a 2-0 lead, apparently prompting a tear to trickle down the cheek of the distraught fan.
The image was beamed around the world, reaching 12 million BBC1 viewers.
The weeping woman has come forward to claim that the footage was taken before the game, however, as she shed a tear at the German national anthem.
It was then inserted by UEFA TV after the 36th minute goal.
Andrea, from DÃ¼sseldorf, said: "I am amazed and angry. I was overwhelmed at the presentation before the kick-off; not when Balotelli scored."

A spokesperson for the BBC said: "We will raise this matter with UEFA."
UEFA said it "never manipulated any images of Euro 2012" but accepted the crying footage was a "human error".
