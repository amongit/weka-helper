Sebastien Ogier maintained his lead on the second day of the WRC Rally of Mexico on Friday, but it was Ott Tanak's crash that was the talk of the race.
The Estonian was coming round a bend when lost control of his Ford Fiesta and hit the bank. Unable to steer the car after the impact he slid off the track and rolled down a steep slope into a lake.
As the car began to sink fast, Tanak and co-driver Raigo Molder managed to scramble to safety, with Molder remarkably keeping hold of his pace notes during the escape.
The shaken drivers managed to swim to safety where they were met by emergency services.
The car was later recovered and repaired, ready to rejoin the race for Saturday's stages.
