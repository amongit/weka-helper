The US Coast Guard and the RAF have abandoned the search for four missing British sailors after discovering the yacht's life raft unused aboard the flooded ship.
American rescue teams found the overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki in a remote part of the Atlantic around 1,000 miles east of Massachusetts.
Families of the four missing men had been clinging to hope that they could still be alive aboard a life raft and awaiting rescue.
However, on Friday night US Navy sailors found the life raft undeployed inside the vessel's flooded cabin, indicating that the men had not used it during their emergency. There was no sign of the men or their bodies, leading the Coast Guard to call off the search.
The US Coast Guard called off its search at midnight (3am British time). The Foreign Office said that an RAF Hercules plane due to continue the hunt for the four sailors would now return to Britain.

The family of Stephen Warren, 52, said in a statement: "We are very sad that the US has now suspended the search for Stephen and his friends.
"From the beginning we, together with the other families involved, have continued to hold out hope that he would be found alive. The US Coast Guard have led an exceptional search. This is now an incredibly difficult time for all the family."
The Coast Guard said the search was only ended after the "deepest consideration".
"It is with sincere compassion for the families of these four men that our thoughts and prayers are with them all during this difficult time," said Captain Anthony Popiel.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: "The UK C130 was due to search for one more day for the life raft of the Cheeki Rafiki.
"In light of the US Coast Guard's decision to suspend their search for the crew following photographic confirmation that the life raft is in the hull of the boat, the C130 will now return to the UK."
Hugh Robertson, the foreign office minister, said: "I am sad to confirm that the search for the Cheeki Rafiki has now been suspended. My sincere condolences go out to the families of James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin at this very difficult and distressing time.
"The UK Government is grateful to the US Coast Guard and the Canadian search and rescue services for their efforts to locate the men. Their dedication has been unwavering, and they have done everything they could during the course of the search."
Mr Warren, Andrew Bridge, 22, James Male, 23, and Paul Goslin, 56, had been sailing the 39-foot yacht from Antigua back to the UK when they ran into trouble last Friday and activated their emergency beacons.
Two C-130 aircraft from the US and one from Canada deployed alongside a small flotilla of volunteer commercial ships to search for the ship.
Last Sunday afternoon, however, the search was called based on the Coast Guard's "survivability model", a formula that calculates how long sailors can survive after being shipwrecked.
After a major public outcry in Britain and a request from the UK government, the Coast Guard agreed to resume the search on Tuesday morning.
A US Navy helicopter found the Cheeki Rafiki's overturned hull on Friday and an American warship headed to the scene. From there a smaller boat and a surface approached the overturned yacht, confirming its name printed on the ship's side.
The swimmer knocked on the hull to see if there was anyone still trapped inside.
The vessel's keel had broken off, allowing water into the hull.
The capsized hull was spotted last week by a Greek container ship but this is the first time rescuers have reached the vessel and confirmed its identity
The two searches involved aircraft from the US, UK and Canada as well as two US military ships. A further nine commercial vessels joined the rescue effort, which scoured 25,000 square miles of ocean.
