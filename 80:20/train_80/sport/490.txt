Katy Perry delivered a spectacular halftime show at the Super Bowl on Sunday assisted by special guests Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz.
Perry entered the field astride a giant, golden, robotic lion as she sang her hit Roar.
Kravitz then brought some rock guitar to proceedings as he duetted with Perry on a version of her debut hit I Kissed a Girl.
The rocker said he was grateful for Perry's call to join her onstage.
"This wasn't my thing. She asked me to come and perform with her and I said, 'Yes' and it ended up being a really great experience," he said in an interview.

After Missy Elliott provided the crowd of over 70,000 with her own distinctive brand of hip-hop, including Get Ur Freak On, Perry performed on a desert island, singing her hits Teenage Dream and "California Gurls".
The halftime show ended with another surprise as Perry was lifted 50 feet off the ground by a mechanical contraption and, as she floated above the field singing Firework, sparkling flames emerged from the construction.
Meanwhile, on the field, the New England Patriots were crowned Super Bowl champions.
They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 to capture their first National Football League title in 10 years.

It was the Patriots' fourth Super Bowl title overall, as they had lost three straight finals since winning three in four years a decade ago.
The victory put New England alongside five other teams with at least four Super Bowl wins, while Tom Brady joined Hall of Famers Terry Bradshaw and childhood idol Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks with four championship rings.
Brady fired four touchdowns, including two in a frantic fourth quarter, to give him a record 13 Super Bowl touchdown passes.
Seattle had a chance to steal a dramatic win after a circus catch by Jermaine Kearse put the Seahawks deep in Patriots territory. But a Russell Wilson pass was intercepted at the goal line by with 20 seconds to play to seal the victory.

Before the game began, Frozen star Idina Menzel belted out an outstanding live rendition of the national anthem.
After she sang the last note, she yelled in excitement: "Yes!"
"I didn't want to rush," Menzel said in an interview after the performance.
"I wanted to take in the moment and connect to the song that I was singing, not get swept away by all the grandiosity and excitement, and connect. And sing from my heart."

Meanwhile, more than 70 commercials were screened during the game, as major brands fought to grab the attention of viewers.
Companies paid up to a record $4.5 million for 30 seconds during the championship game on Comcast Corp's NBC network, which was seen by an estimated 100 million-plus viewers - the year's biggest television audience.
Budweiser capitalized on cuteness with the return of a puppy and Coca-Cola stood out with an anti-bullying message as many brands stirred emotions rather than going for laughs during the annual high-stakes battle of Super Bowl adverts.
