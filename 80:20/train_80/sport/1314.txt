Warrington Town manager Shaun Reid prepared to give Exeter City a tough time in FA Cup first round

Two words were written on the whiteboard in Warrington Town’s cramped dressing room: “Controlled Aggression.” As he showed Telegraph Sport around the Evo-stik Northern League club’s compact, canalside ground, Shaun Reid paused for a moment in front of the board, stared at it and then said.
“Controlled aggression, eh? All I need do now is to control my own bleedin’ aggression.”
Reid, the 49-year-old younger brother of Peter, was a fearsomely competitive midfielder who played for Rochdale, York, Bury and finally Chester through the Eighties and Nineties. He made 432 league appearances, every single one of them in the fourth tier.
And on Friday night he will be in Warrington’s cramped concrete bunker of a dug-out trying to calm his inner rage as manager of the lowest ranked club left in the FA Cup.
When he sends his team of part-timers out to face Exeter City in the televised first round, live on the BBC, it will be, he explained, easily the proudest moment of his fledgling managerial career.

“It drives me crackers the devaluation of the FA Cup. I remember growing up, the FA Cup final was the greatest day of the football calendar. It’s been devalued by people who don’t care about the game. If you want to know what the FA Cup means come and have a look at my lads’ faces when they come out that dressing room door. That’ll tell you all you need to know what this competition is all about.”
As he spoke, a scaffolding television gantry was being erected atop the ground’s Lego-scale main stand. Behind him Toby Macormac, Warrington’s chairman, was cleaning the clubhouse windows. The groundsman was firing up his spluttering lawnmower and attempting to cut photogenic stripes into the playing surface. Tonight some 2,500 paying customers will squeeze around the pitch, most of them standing. Tickets for the game, Reid said, sold out in an hour.
“Everyone knows this as a rugby town. But for us to sell out that quick tells you there’s a lot of football folk here who’d love to follow a successful club. We intend to give them that.”
Reid said he expected dozens of the disappointed without tickets to watch from the bridge overlooking the ground; more will bring step ladders and peer over the top of the fence running down the canal towpath. All in all, it will be something of an increase on the scale of the crowd who used to turn up when he took over at the club in March 2012.
“We’d get crowds of 75, less,” Reid said. “We’ve come a long way in a short time. I remember first time I came here, and took a training session, the chairman says to me after, ‘What do you reckon?’ I said, yeah, I fancy the job. But we’ll have to get rid of this lot and get some footballers in.”
Reid did that, completely overhauling the squad, first playing the youth team, then calling in favours and recruiting on social media. It worked. In his second full season in charge, he took the club to the Evostik play-offs. Now, in his third, the club has reached the FA Cup first round for the first time.
“I said to my players before they went out against North Ferriby in the last round, in your career there’ll be times you’ve got a chance of making history,” Reid recalled. “Very rare it happens. For these lads to get to the first round proper is history for them, it’s the same as me brother playing against Maradona. I don’t think people realise how big this is.” And for Reid himself, he said, it threatened to be his finest FA Cup memory.
“I played some big teams in my time in the cup, Watford, Southampton. We played against Wimbledon in the Crazy Gang times. That was an interesting day. I was up against Vinnie Jones. He told me in no uncertain terms in the tunnel how he’d done a job on my brother a couple of weeks before and how he was going to do the same on me.
"Well he got more than they bargained for in that game. We could have played without a ball, to be honest. We ran round kicking lumps out of each other for 90 minutes.” Which is not an option open to his team against Exeter this evening.
“Don’t get me started on that,” Reid snarled. “You can’t make tackles like we used to anymore. I wouldn’t last two minutes in today’s game. I don’t believe me brother would either. The FA, Fifa, Uefa, they’ve decided to make it a non-contact sport. Which makes it harder for the underdog. And it’s why the people at the top end are happy with the rules, because no one can challenge them.
“Listen, I don’t want to see anybody get hurt on a football pitch, but even good tackles you get booked nowadays. That’s wrong. I asked once on a coaching course, hang on, we’ve done passing, finishing, formations, transition, when are we going to do tackling? They looked at me like I was mad. That said something to me about the way the game’s going.”
Not that, he insisted, his more elevated visitors should expect anything but the most brusque of welcomes when they arrive at Warrington.
“You can still do things on a football pitch to intimidate people,” he said. “If Exeter think they are going to come here and not be tackled, chased, squeezed, made uncomfortable for 90 minutes then I’m afraid they’re going to be in for a shock.”
The pitch, he added, would be a serious area of advantage to the home side. “The groundsman told me he was going to put a roller over it. I said you dare and I’ll put a bleedin’ roller over you. I want every bobble left out there. They won’t enjoy playing on it. I hear they like to pass the ball. Well all the best on that pitch, lads.”
For all his confidence, however, Reid is aware that Exeter stand 97 places above his team in the league pyramid. And it is not often Exeter step out with that sort of advantage.
“Let’s be realistic Exeter City should beat Warrington Town nine times out of 10,” he said. “I’m planning for that one time out of 10.” In order to do so, he had rung round mates in the coaching game and had compiled a substantial dossier on his opponents.
“I know far more about them than they will know about us. I know their manager [Paul Tisdale] is the longest-serving manager in the league after Arsène Wenger. There’s a reason for that. He’s doing a great job. I also know he’s one of the smartest. I’m going to try and outdo him on that as well. So any sponsors out there want to throw me an Armani suit, I wouldn’t say no.” And in his fancy threads tonight, Reid is expecting to find himself on a very crowded bench.
“There’s so many people after tickets, I expect they’ll put them in the dug-out,” he said. “I’ve had calls from people looking for tickets I didn’t even realise were my friends.” Not that his brother will be amongst them.
“Nah, sadly Peter’s in India, he’s managing in the new Premier League there,” he said. “He’s got some decent players over there. He’s got [Nicolas] Anelka. I asked him to loan me him for this game. But he said he needed him. So much for brotherly love, eh?”
