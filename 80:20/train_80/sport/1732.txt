Olivier Hanlan Sweeps NetScouts Basketball Weekly Awards
Boston College has recently had a rough stretch in conference play, but Olivier Hanlan had a big week to help snap a nine-game losing streak. The Quebec, Canada native is the first player this season to be named both NetScouts Basketball's National Player of the Week and International Player of the Week. The award is for games from February 23rd through March 1st.
Hanlan started the week with a season-high 39 points while shooting 10-of-20 from the field, 5-of-12 from three-point range, and 14-of-14 from the free throw line, but Boston College fell on the road to Pittsburgh. He had another strong performance to snap the losing streak against N.C. State, scoring 24 points on 7-of-11 shooting. He added eight rebounds and three assists in Boston College's first win since January 25th. Hanlan averaged 31.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game on the week while shooting 54.8 percent (17-of-31) from the floor, 50 percent (8-of-16) from deep, and 95.5 percent (21-of-22) from the charity stripe.
Boston College is just 10-18 this season, but Hanlan has been one of the top players in the conference. The junior is averaging 19.6 points, 4.2 assists, and 4.0 rebounds per game this season while shooting an efficient 46.3 percent from the field and 37.0 percent from behind the arc. Boston College faces Virginia Tech and Wake Forest before entering the ACC Tournament.
