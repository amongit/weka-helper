Brazilian surfer Ricardo dos Santos has died after being shot three times in the abdomen on Monday in front of his house on Guarda do Embau beach, near Florianopolis.
The 24-year-old was flown by helicopter to hospital but died of his injuries.
Investigator Marcelo Arruda said that the officer who shot the unarmed surfer did so in self defence.
But other witnesses say officer Luis Brentano shot dos Santos after they got into an argument.
