Sad Tim Duncan Photo Is Saddest Of All These Sad Spurs Photos From NBA Finals Game 7 Loss (VIDEO)
While the Miami Heat were experiencing the thrill of victory, the San Antonio Spurs were dealing with the agony of defeat.
"Game 7 is always going to haunt me," Tim Duncan told reporters after his team lost the climactic contest of the 2013 NBA Finals to the Heat, 95-88. With his fifth career title hanging in the balance, Duncan missed a potential game-tying shot in the final minute of Game 7.

One of Duncan's teammates, Manu Ginobili, told reporters that he was still stuck on the team's loss in Game 6, when the Spurs were seconds from clinching the championship before Ray Allen forced overtime. The Heat would then go on to force a Game 7 with a 103-100 OT win.
"In my case, I still have Game 6 in my head," Ginobili told reporters after Game 7. "Today we played an okay game, they just made more shots than us. LeBron got hot. Shane, too. Those things can happen. But being so close and feeling that you are about to grab that trophy, and then seeing it vanish is very hard."
Regardless of which loss bothered them most, several members of the Western Conference champion Spurs (as well as many of their fans) couldn't hide their emotions.
