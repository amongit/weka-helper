Oscar Pistorius: reports of testosterone and syringes found at house may give impetus for sports drug hearing

Pistorius's defence lawyer dismissed the claim, saying the "testosterone" found was in fact a permitted herbal medicine, named as 'testo compositum coenzyme.'
Pistorius has more serious matters at hand, defending premeditated murder charges and insisting he acted in self defence believing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was a burglar.
But the discovery of drugs in his possession would be enough for the authorities to take action â€“ if only to satisfy Pistorius' competitors at the London 2012 Olympics that he was not cheating, rather than to prevent him from competing.
Pistorius is unlikely to return to the track in the immediate future after admitting he had fired the four shots that killed Steenkamp.
South African Institute for Drug Free sport would be the authority to hear the sports drugs case against Pistorius but it is likely they would delay any such action until the court case against the runner is concluded.

Testing of the substance will determine exactly what the drug contained.
Testosterone is banned in sport because it helps build strength and muscle mass, aids recovery and enhances sex drive and athletes face two year sanctions for a first offence if they test positive to the drug.
But authorities also can use evidence from government agencies such as immigration and customs, as well as police and courts to ban athletes.
If any evidence emerges that the drug in Pistorius' bedroom was testosterone and Pistorius had been consuming it for some time he could have his London 2012 Paralympic medals stripped and they could be redistributed to other athletes who placed in the respective races.
American Blake Leeper would be upgraded to the gold in Pistorius' best event, the T44 400m. Pistorius' world records and times from the Games would also be annulled.
The International Paralympic Committee, which tested Pistorius during the Paralympics and found no drugs in his system, will have to wait until the SAIDS conducts a hearing before determining if any such medal redistribution and record annulment is to occur.
