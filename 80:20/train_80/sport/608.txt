British cycling Olympic gold medallists Laura Trott and Jason Kenny enjoyed a double celebration on Christmas Day, as the pair announced they are engaged to be married.
Trott, 22, who won team pursuit and omnium gold at the London Olympics, said Kenny had given her the perfect Christmas present.
"Merry Christmas everyone. I've had the most amazing couple of days thanks to @JasonKenny107 and the whole family #engaged", she tweeted.
Kenny, 26, like Trott won two gold medals in London in the team sprint and the individual sprint to add to the team sprint title he won in the 2008 Games in Beijing.
The pair will continue to juggle their partnership and cycling commitments – Trott races professionally for the Wiggle-Honda team and won the 2014 British Championship Road Race, while Kenny is at Team Sky.
