Surfers braved "the most dangerous wave in the world" as they took part in Red Bull's Cape Fear competition on Sunday.
Sydney, Australia's Botany Bay played host to the inaugural event, which saw 16 elite surfers go head-to-head riding giant waves.
The 6 to 8ft waves that crash over one of the world's deadliest reefs make the challenge one of the most difficult in the world. Organisers even claim it to be the most dangerous.
Competition director and competitor Mark Matthews said: "it's a big wave surfing event, but it's not a big wave surfing event based on size, it's based on a danger scale."
