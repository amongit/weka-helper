Talladega to add more SAFER barriers before NASCAR race
TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Talladega Superspeedway will add SAFER barriers in three places before NASCAR visits in May.
Talladega chairman Grant Lynch says the decision comes after an extensive safety review by track owner International Speedway Corp., NASCAR and ARCA. All tracks are being looked at in the wake of Kyle Busch's crash into a concrete wall last month at Daytona.
Busch broke his right leg and left foot when he hit a wall that lacked the energy-absorbing barrier.
Talladega will add SAFER barrier before the May 3 race to the inside wall at the entrances to pit road, Turn 1 and Turn 3.
Lynch says Talladega will continue to review its safety initiatives and provide updates as circumstances warrant.
