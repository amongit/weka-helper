They think it’s all over. It is now. How those words haunt England. The national team’s latest failure, being the worst performance since they failed to qualify for USA 94, demands an apology from the FA, Roy Hodgson and the players to all those thousands of fans who loyally trooped to Brazil only to be royally let down.
Rather than anger, the mood was more one of inevitable frustration at the team’s demise after only two games, their fate sealed by Costa Rica’s victory over Italy.
The fans did not expect much, but they expected more than this; at least give them the inevitable pain of penalties. But this was humiliating, being turfed out of this wonderful party before they had hardly tasted their first caipirinha.
England supporters will now complete their expensive travel plans, heading to Belo Horizonte for the dead rubber against Costa Rica, with the need for Hodgson to give them some hope for the future.

Now that Hodgson has been confirmed by the FA as the man to lead England to Euro 2016, the focus turns to new blood, with players such as John Stones and Jon Flanagan required and a new captain needed. Wayne Rooney is expected to succeed Steven Gerrard.
Hodgson was confident in a new era. “I believe the team going forward will be a very good team,” he said.
Now that it is all over, it is time for a clean break, for Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Phil Jagielka, Glen Johnson, Leighton Baines and Rickie Lambert to step down (and yet how good it was to see Lambert at least return with the pride of getting that World Cup appearance, deserved reward for all those years toiling in the lower leagues).
Gerrard has served his country with great dedication, and has been a fine role model for the younger players with his hunger and humility. England are still short of leaders, a reflection on the academy system, and arguably societal changes, so Gerrard will be missed.
Yet he is 34. He looked tired in Brazil, perhaps a result of Hodgson’s mistaken decision to play him in the FA’s 150th birthday celebrations against Chile and Germany last November rather than tell the Liverpool midfielder to recharge his batteries somewhere sunny.
Rooney is not a natural leader, and the FA could have some bumpy moments, but he deserves the chance. He has withstood plenty of criticism over the past few weeks, probably past few months and years but he delivered that goal, that moment of redemption and brief hope against Uruguay, before Luis Suárez completed the coup de grace.
“The team is evolving,’’ said Hodgson. “I believe the team going forward will be a very good team. I think there are good young players. Even against Uruguay we saw some good individual performances and the young ones that came on, even, they did quite well. But results colour everything. I don’t think there’s any need to have any doubts this England group of players will go on to do good things in the time ahead.’’
There is the nucleus of a promising squad. Joe Hart rightly continues in goal with Fraser Forster and, assuming he regains form, Jack Butland covering, unless Hodgson sees merit in keeping on the 31-year-old Ben Foster. Jon Flanagan needs assessing at right-back. He has an exuberant attacking streak and, potentially, superior defensive qualities to Johnson. Flanagan can also cover the left. Martin Kelly’s misfortune with injury is as frustrating for his country as for him and his club.
The buccaneering Luke Shaw, still learning defensively, is a shoo-in at left-back, partly because Leighton Baines has hardly seized his opportunity in Brazil. Ashley Cole was missed.
Another Chelsea player, Gary Cahill, may not be quite the well organised force without John Terry’s guidance but he was the only defender to emerge from Sao Paulo with much credit. Cahill could be a candidate for the captaincy if Rooney’s case was not stronger.
Alongside Cahill, Hodgson should look at John Stones. Everton manager Roberto Martínez has been eulogising about his young centre-half. He has composure, touch and is able to turn defence into attack.
There is always the vexed issue of Phil Jones, whether he should play centre-half or central midfield. If centre-half is his best position, Jones could be used as an emergency holding midfielder partly because of a deficit of contenders in that position.
Jordan Henderson retains his place, accompanied in deep midfield of a 4-2-3-1 system by Jack Wilshere. The Arsenal midfielder has the ability, the close control and fortitude to operate here, pushing on and linking with the attack.
His club-mate, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, also possesses the qualities to play in the centre and provides a strong option out wide.
By September, Theo Walcott should be fit, adding to Hodgson’s string of fliers that includes Raheem Sterling and Andros Townsend as well as Oxlade-Chamberlain.
Hodgson will still have the problem of accommodating Rooney and Ross Barkley in the same formation – with both best suited to the No 10 role – unless he reverts to a Christmas tree formation.
England v Norway Sep 3, Wembley, proposed squad: Hart, Forster, Butland; Flanagan, Walker, Jones, Smalling, Cahill, Stones, Shaw; Henderson, Wilshere, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sterling, Townsend, Walcott, Milner, Barkley, Rodriguez, Lallana; Rooney, Sturridge, Welbeck.
