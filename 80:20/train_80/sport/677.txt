Tottenham Hotspur have identified Antoine Griezmann as the man they want to fill Gareth Bale’s boots, a year after the Welshman left White Hart Lane. But Spurs face a battle to land Griezmann, with Monaco interested in the French international and Chelsea also keeping a watching brief on the situation.
Tottenham are understood to have already made one bid for Griezmann, but have been told they will have to meet the £25 million buy-out clause in his Real Sociedad contract.
That still might not be enough, as Monaco could offer Griezmann Champions League football and much higher wages.
Tottenham did not buy a direct replacement for Bale after selling him to Real Madrid for £85 million last summer, instead trying to cover for his loss with a host of signings who enjoyed mixed fortunes.
Recognising that the team lack power and in the absence of Bale, Spurs have made signing a top-quality forward who can drift in from the left to create and score goals a priority. Griezmann has identified as that man, following an impressive season for Sociedad, where he scored 20 goals, and good performances for France in the World Cup.

Other than Monaco, Chelsea have looked at Griezmann and will play Sociedad in a pre-season friendly at Stamford Bridge on Aug 12.
Tottenham will hope that goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who is Griezmann’s captain for France, can help to convince the 23-year-old to join him in the Premier League at White Hart Lane. Lloris signed a new five-year contract with Spurs this month and spoke of the club’s ambition, which includes trying to sign Griezmann and another of his France team-mates, Morgan Schneiderlin.
Tottenham have also been looking at PSV Eindhoven left winger Memphis Depay in case they miss out on Griezmann. Spurs’ north London rivals Arsenal have also been looking at Southampton midfielder Schneiderlin, but the 24-year-old’s relationship with his former manager Mauricio Pochettino could be vital.
“I think a manager like that is good for every club,” Schneiderlin said. “With the quality Tottenham have, Mauricio Pochettino will get the best out of each player.
“He came in and made Southampton play and now Tottenham have a great future.
“He improved me very much. He improved the whole squad and improved me as a player. He’s a great coach and good man and it’s a shame Southampton lost him.”
Having agreed deals to sign left-back Ben Davies and Michel Vorm from Swansea City, Tottenham allowed Gylfi Sigurdsson to leave their tour of the United States to complete his move back to the Welsh club.
