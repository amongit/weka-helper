London 2012 Olympics: Beach volleyball offers London sun, sand and skimpy outfits

Right on time, at nine o’clock, brazen and brassy with its mirrored shades, suntans and the skimpiest of swimwear, it took to the sand.
It was a concept right out of Spike Milligan: take a patch of Horse Guards Parade, mark it out with tiers of purple seating, plonk tonnes of beach in the middle, play a bit of Benny Hill music, strip off and play.
It was quite the campest, highest-risk strategy this side of Beijing, but it works, beautifully.
The setting is awesome. The London Eye turns gracefully, imperceptibly to the south while Big Ben peers over the top of the Downing Street End, struck mute by the persistent blasts of top decibel musical medleys.
The band of the Blues and Royals resplendent in ceremonial dress prep the earlycomers with a brass version of Europop anthem The Final Countdown.

The crowd have an absolute ball – encouraged to scream and shout and stamp and olé at every opportunity, including set and match points.
And those in the lowest seats also get an eyeful of all but the most intimate parts of the athletes’ bodies: it must be one of the few sports where the dancers wear considerably more than the athletes.
Beach volleyball became an Olympic sport at Atlanta and has in the intervening years become more famous for its swimwear than its athleticism.
Most coverage strikes a slightly dribbling tone, with The Sun outraged when it was suggested that the players would cover up if British summer fouled up and temperature fell below 16C. Beach Bummer read the disappointed headline.
But, in fact, the real sun did its job, burning through the cloud to be scorchingly hot by late morning, with the sand reaching a temperature of 19.5C – uncomfortably hot to land in.
The female players do wear a costume best described by most women as “you have got to be joking”.
On the evidence so far, teams don’t stray from a fig leaf of a pair of pants and a larger, though hardly substantial bikini top. Hardly the most practical outfit to spike and dive with 10,000 people watching your every move and a TV camera up your bottom.
But the victorious 6ft German Ilka Semmler, slayer of the Czechs, said that they designed their costumes themselves – “the colour, where to put the flag and a little more here and a little less there”.
They do have the bodies to show them off, sculpted six packs in the middle and powerful arms and legs to top and tail the core.
The men meanwhile relax in board shorts and muscle T-shirts, not Speedos, an unfair clothing comparison which reflects the good taste of the female spectator rather than any latent sexism.
The morning session actually was stolen by a man nicknamed the Lion King, Aleksandrs Samoilovs. He was the bouffant-haired half of the Latvian team that defeated the Poles two sets to one and never walked when he could bound.
The crowd was made up of a mixture of people: a happy product of the ticketing system. It seemed equally gender divided with lads, grannies, babies stacked on top of each other.
There was no sign of Prince Harry but the presence in the VIP seats of Chris Patten and the Latvian president in the morning and Boris Johnson and Kofi Annan in the afternoon told you something about the nuttiness of the whole thing – and possibly about middle-aged men.
There may have been the odd person who knew exactly what was going on but the rest were there for the pure thrill: every volunteer, every official, every player, every sand-raker (a designated role) received a roar of approval.
Even when the British men appeared in the afternoon they received magnificent support but they failed to use it to their advantage, losing in two sets to Canada.
The strangeness is that for all the talk, unless you’re in the front row seats (a swathe of which were left empty by IOC delegates) or a journalist able to examine them up close in the mixed zone, this is not a very lascivious experience.
The voyeuristic aspect must have been higher for the viewer sitting at home with his high-definition television for company.
What those in Horse Guards Parade saw were top-class, if slightly naked, athletes: what they had was a total ball.
