Misty May-Treanor Retires After 3rd Olympic Beach Volleyball Gold With Kerri Walsh Jennings (PHOTOS)
-- American beach volleyball star Misty May-Treanor left no doubt after teaming with Kerri Walsh Jennings for a third straight gold medal that this is it for her on the sand.
"This is my last match," she says. "Beach volleyball's not going to be my career anymore. ... It's time for me to be a wife. I want to be a mom and share time with my family. All of us as athletes sacrifice more on the family end than people realize. And it's getting back to that. My mind says it's time. My body says it's time. And it's the right time."
