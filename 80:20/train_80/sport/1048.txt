Sepp Blatter's sly sidekick Jerome Valcke is guilty of contemptible cynicism with Qatar human rights claim

Think of Jérôme Valcke as a latter-day Iago, complete with a polished pair of French cufflinks. Reptilian and utterly ruthless, Fifa’s most Machiavellian courtier slithers from one five-star banqueting hall to the next, his dissembling platitudes like toxic treacle. There would, he declared in Doha on Wednesday, be no apology for shunting the Qatar World Cup to November-December 2022, a monumental vexation of Fifa’s own making – not to mention one that they had quietly been planning all along. There would be no compensation, either, for the decimating of festive football schedules. One is tempted to describe Fifa as the Grinch that stole Christmas, except not even Dr Seuss could have scripted a tale so spirit-sappingly self-serving.
The latest performance by Valcke was, even by his standards, beyond the pale. Fresh from claiming, with staggering gall, that a 28-day World Cup inelegantly shoehorned into the Advent season was “part of the concession we are making”, he then used his Twitter account to argue that Qatar 2022 would serve as a “catalyst” for human rights reform. It was a statement of contemptible cynicism. One imagined that Fifa had no nadir left to reach in the realm of unconscious irony – think, perhaps, of Sepp Blatter’s claim that his pestilent institution had “taken the lead” on ethics – but their secretary-general might just have managed it.
Returning from a glimpse of workers’ living quarters at Doha’s Al Wakrah Stadium, all spruced-up and window-dressed for his visit, Valcke suggested that the supposed improvements in Qatar’s kafala labour system were down to the “power of the World Cup”. Ah, yes, human rights: everybody recalls those being top of the agenda when Fifa decided to award football’s grandest show to a tiny spit of sand in the Persian Gulf. All the alleged bribes – £6,500 for the Yemeni federation chief here, £65,000 for the Somalian gentlemen over there – from a Mohammed bin Hammam slush fund? Better ask Michael Garcia. Actually, better not, given his report on Fifa’s quagmire of corruption was sanitised enough to trigger his resignation.

Valcke exemplifies the classic Fifa style of doing business: institute a revoltingly venal voting system that yields a World Cup nobody wants, stand aside as over 1,200 migrant labourers die in hotter-than-Hades conditions to build their stadiums, then try to take all the credit at the first signs of redress. Too easily, perhaps, there is an instinct to caricature Blatter as the culprit in all this. His apologists point out that he did not actually vote for Qatar, although this is a specious argument – he enabled the grace-and-favour culture that allowed the tournament to go there in the first place. It is simply that he is a figure of such cartoonish incompetence that any further attempt at blaming him exclusively feels reductive. Time, surely, to focus our ire on the man who for eight years has conducted so much of his slippery work for him: Valcke.

Who tried to ensure that Fifa executives arriving in Brazil for the last World Cup were lavished not just with one £16,000 Parmigiani watch, but two? Valcke. Who, in seeking to justify that glorious dictatorship double-header of Russia and Qatar, said that “less democracy is sometimes better for organising a World Cup”? Valcke. And who, as early as September 2013, admitted to reporters at an Olympic congress in Buenos Aires that switching Qatar 2022 from summer to winter was effectively a done deal? Why, Valcke again.
Valcke knew, in common with every other sentient being, that a World Cup in a 50-degree furnace would never work. But it would not do to say so openly. That is why he staged that sly little briefing in Argentina, because he knew he would have to wait a while before Fifa’s member associations all obediently fell into line with the idea of a November date. Thus did Valcke shamelessly take the plaudits on Wednesday for the work of a spurious ‘taskforce’, set up to purely to rubber-stamp an outcome that he had acknowledged 18 months ago was preordained.

You see, over in Fifa’s Bond-villain Zurich lair, they love a fig-leaf. They have enough of them to fill an entire field in Cyprus. A so-called taskforce – led by Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, who belongs to the ruling family in the beacon of democracy that is Bahrain – is a fig-leaf that not only allows them to conceal their ghastly mistake in choosing Qatar, but to flip the narrative 180 degrees so that they make it look like that they are doing everyone a favour. And now Valcke is using the veneer of progress in the labour situation, where workers packed 10 to a room in Doha have died in their hundreds from cardiac arrest, as a fig-leaf for a rotten vote. It is, frankly, despicable.

Still, Valcke is a figure who somehow rose to become Fifa secretary-general despite being found by a New York judge to have lied to Visa and Mastercard in the bidding for World Cup sponsorship rights in 2010 and 2014. “In business we don’t always tell the truth,” he said then, by way of explanation. Valcke achieved the seemingly impossible: he was sacked by Fifa from his job as marketing director, who thundered that it “could not possibly accept such conduct among our own employees”. One wonders what, short of robbing a bank, a man must do to prompt Fifa to deliver such savage rebuke. And yet Valcke, patronage restored by his good mate Blatter, has since re-emerged as the power behind the throne, tricking football all over again with duplicitous double-speak about Qatar. And the truly sad part is that football is falling for it.
