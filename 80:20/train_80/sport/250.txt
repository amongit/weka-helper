Freddie Roach has claimed that Floyd Mayweather's team are blocking potential sparring partners by paying them to stay away from Manny Pacquiao ahead of the mega-fight on May 2 in Las Vegas.
Roach is also prepping Pacquiao for Mayweather talking to him in the ring, comparing the unbeaten American to Muhammad Ali.
Roach believes that several sparring partners they chose with similar fighting style to Mayweather, turned down their offer to join them in camp in Hollywood because Al Haymon's team have offered them more more money to stay at home.
"I'm hiring sparring partners, Al Haymon's people calls them up and offers more money for them not to come. [But] I'm not worried about those guys," Roach told ABS-CBN News.
"We got four really good sparring partners for Manny for this fight, Mayweather look-alikes.

"We started our game plan five years ago but we changed it a little bit. Definitely there will be some adjustments. I'm confident that we'll win the fight and this will be the biggest fight night of all our lives.
"The guy is undefeated, he's a very good boxer and he's the most talented fighter we'll ever face. He's tricky also... he's intelligent as a fighter. I believe we need to fight the perfect fight."
Roach is also concerned that Mayweather can get into his charge's head. "Manny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers," said Roach.
"Mayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game. I'm really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can't let himself get distracted."
