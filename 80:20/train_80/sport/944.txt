How cycling is offering the war orphans of Rwanda a route out of trauma

It is not that Jonathan ‘Jock’ Boyer does not care about what happened in Rwanda 20 years ago. Far from it. The American head coach of Team Rwanda – the much-celebrated cycling project which has been transformed, Cool Runnings-style, into a cause célèbre of the sporting world thanks to its powerful, redemptive message – readily admits that he “did not really know about the genocide” when he first arrived in the country back in 2006. Boyer had to look Rwanda up on a map just to find out where it was. Boyer has, though, dedicated the last eight years of his life to helping the survivors and orphans of that atrocity. He clearly cares deeply about his riders.
It is just that he, like many Rwandans, sees no benefit in looking back. “You could pick any one of our guys and make a human interest story out of him,” Boyer concedes. “Their experiences are unbelievable. Terrifying. But they don’t feel the need to talk about it constantly. We prefer to look forwards not backwards.”
That is easier said than done in a country still raw from the atrocities of 1994 when an estimated 800,000 mainly Tutsi Rwandans, amounting to one in 10 of the population, were slaughtered in 100 days by Hutu mobs. The fallout from those three terrifying, lawless months permeates everything in Rwanda; from politics to culture to sport.
On Sunday, the sixth Tour of Rwanda of the modern era – that is to say, the sixth sanctioned by cycling’s world governing body the UCI – begins.
As has become customary, it will open with a short prologue around the Amahoro Stadium in Rwanda’s capital Kigali. It is a place synonymous with the genocide. In 1994, the stadium was for a while a UN Protected Site providing shelter to around 12,000 mainly Tutsi refugees.

This year the memories will resonate that bit more strongly. The 20th anniversary commemorations have seen a huge outpouring of emotion, most notably the event held in Amahoro Stadium on April 7 which was attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair among other global figures.
So while Boyer says that his riders prefer to look forward, it is inevitable that they will feel the ghosts of the past when they set off on Sunday. How could they not? The generation Boyer works with were mostly children in 1994. They all have stories to tell. Abraham Ruhumuriza, for instance, one of Boyer’s first and most talented riders, who will be competing again this year. “He was 15 during the genocide,” Boyer says of Ruhumuriza on the Team Rwanda website. “He lived in Butare, one of the bloody epicentres of slaughter. There are stories that this man holds within that are so terrifying they haunt his inner core, inaccessible yet simmering under the surface. Inside the stadium in his home town, 20,000 people were corralled and hacked to death.”
Stories like Ruhumuriza’s, told so movingly in the Forest Whitaker-narrated documentary Rising from the Ashes and in Tim Lewis’s brilliant book Land of Second Chances (Yellow Jersey 2013), are what make the Team Rwanda project so harrowing and so remarkable.
Boyer himself is a fascinating and controversial character. The first American to ride in the Tour de France back in 1981, when he helped legendary Frenchman Bernard Hinault to the third of his five Tour victories, the 59-year-old is clearly a trailblazer, an innovator, a hugely driven individual. He is also a convicted sex offender who admitted to his crime in 2002 and was sentenced to 20 years in jail, later reduced to five years, probation and a jail term of one year.
Boyer’s decision to take on the challenge in Rwanda was largely down to the need to make sense of his life, to atone for his mistakes.
Whether or not he can ever do so is for others to judge but Rwanda, where victims have learned to live side by side with their oppressors, is in many respects the perfect country in which to seek forgiveness. And the team’s achievements thus far are, by any reckoning, remarkable. Against all odds, and with a “tiny” annual budget of about $300,000 (£190,000), most of it donations from America, South Africa and Europe, Boyer has fashioned a cycling team that has scored a number of unlikely successes.
Its most celebrated graduate, Adrien Niyonshuti, whose six siblings were all brutally hacked down in 1994 and whose qualification for the mountain bike event at the London 2012 Olympics formed the basis of Land of Second Chances, now rides for the South African ProContinental team MTN-Qhubeka who are hoping for a Tour de France invitation next summer.
This year Boyer has teamed up with the cycling federations of Ethiopia and Eritrea to form Team Africa Rising, opening a new centre in Rwanda with the goal of producing world-class African riders.
Boyer’s wife Kimberly Coats, the team’s director of marketing and logistics, is busy trying to set up a women’s Tour of Rwanda for next year, a project to which Great Britain’s endurance queen Chrissie Wellington has hitched her colours. Wellington will be a guest of the team next week and says she believes passionately in the project.
“I’ve always been fascinated by Rwanda, since studying for an MA international development,” Wellington told The Telegraph this week. “I became involved in the project a couple of years ago but it will be really good for me to see first-hand the work Team Rwanda is doing. I’ve also got meetings with DFID Rwanda and with the president of the cycling federation. I’m excited. If they get the right funding and support there is no reason why Africa cannot produce cycling champions.”
Boyer remains convinced of it. “Optimistically I would say the next five years,” he says. “Realistically I would say the next 10 years. The depth of talent out here is staggering and the encouraging thing is that the infrastructure is slowly improving. I was in Eritrea last week and they now have 100 kids aged 16-18, all chomping at the bit.
"Eritrea has a culture of cycling going back 60 years because of the association with Italy. They have hundreds of races over there. There is so much natural talent it is just about getting them on the right programmes.
“Even in Rwanda we have kids coming through now who are the future. They are even stronger than Adrien. Their genetic advantages ... they have natural hematocrit levels above 50 per cent which means their ability to recover is high.”
The trick, of course, is in harnessing those physiological advantages and creating a winner despite all the factors ranged against them. It is not as simple as simply going to the Rift Valley and discovering a factory line of ready-made marathon champions.
“Running is a lot less complex than cycling,” Boyer says. “The obstacles of infrastructure, of road surfaces, of equipment, of tactics are not the same at all. You cannot become a cyclist in Sudan, for instance, because there aren’t the paved roads. That is why going forward we are in such a good position with centres in Ethiopia and Eritrea, sharing knowledge and facilities.”
For now the most likely route looks to be developing the riders to a certain level and then farming them out to bigger teams, whether that be in Europe or in South Africa with MTN-Qhubeka.
Niyonshuti will not be lining up with his former team-mates in this year’s Tour of Rwanda, with Brian Smith, the interim general manager of MTN-Qhubeka explaining that the team are “concentrating on 2015”.
His absence is clearly a source of frustration for Boyer and for Rwanda, where Niyonshuti remains a huge star, but if it leads to a Tour de France appearance for one of Rwanda’s orphaned children next summer, Boyer will not be complaining.
Niyonshuti was just seven when, 20 years ago, he and his parents spent nearly a week cowering in a darkened room in his hometown of Rwamagana before being discovered and marched out into the street to face almost certain death.
Only a torrential rainstorm scattered the mob and by the time they returned the following day the RPF rebels were sweeping back through Rwanda. The rest of his family were not so lucky. After the genocide, more than 40 of Niyonshuti’s relatives, including five brothers and a sister, were found murdered at his grandmother’s house. “If they get a Tour invitation and Adrien rides, I would be the happiest man alive.”
