Lady Andrade Suspended For Abby Wambach Punch: Colombia Soccer Player Gets Two-Match Ban
LONDON -- FIFA has imposed a two-match ban on Colombia player Lady Andrade after U.S. forward Abby Wambach said she was "sucker-punched" by her opponent in an Olympic soccer match.
FIFA says its disciplinary committee suspended Andrade for a group match against France on Tuesday, and for the quarterfinals if Colombia advances.
Wambach said she was hit in the right eye by Andrade in the 39th minute of a 3-0 win over Colombia on Saturday.
After the game, Wambach called for FIFA to take action, while Andrade said it was "an accident."
The U.S. team did not file a formal complaint against Andrade, but it did contact FIFA.
