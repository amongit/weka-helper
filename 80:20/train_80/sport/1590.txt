Detroit Pistons Dancer Makes Backward Half-Court Shot Like A Pro
Someone's got skills.
Detroit Pistons dancer Kathryn Martin heaved a shot backward from mid-court and hit nothing but net during halftime of the Pistons-Knicks game Friday. The crowd roared, and the dancer was carried triumphantly by the Pistons mascot.
She never made the shot when she practiced it, a Pistons rep told The Huffington Post, but she "made the shot when it counted."
Given that the Pistons are mired in the NBA's Central Division cellar, maybe they ought to consider signing her up and letting someone else do the halftime entertaining.
