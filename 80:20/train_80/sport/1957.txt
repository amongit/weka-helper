Annie The Psychic Anteater Predicts The Winner Of The Heat vs. Thunder In NBA Finals (VIDEO)
Annie the Anteater is back, and this time she's taking her talents to South Beach.
Well, sort of.
The "psychic" anteater is staying in Paramus, N.J. but is applying her talents to divine the fate of the hoops team from South Beach. You may already be familiar with Annie as she recently predicted the L.A. Kings to win the Stanley Cup Finals.
Annie was once again presented with two bowls, each branded with a logo representing either the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Miami Heat. After what seemed like a quick assessment of the two, she confidently pulled the Miami bowl toward herself before chowing down on her pick.
The worm-tongued mammal has yet to see her Stanley Cup prediction play out, but the Kings currently lead the series 3-2, and have the opportunity to close out the Finals with just one more win.
Presumably, the Heat wouldn't mind starting the series with a 3-0 series lead, either.
