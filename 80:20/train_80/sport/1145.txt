My School Sport: Olympic medallist Samantha Murray says there is a sport out there for everyone

She was taught to ride by her grandmother, she has an auntie who represented England at gymnastics. The family tradition continues – her 16-year-old brother William is one of the top swimmers in his age group in the country and 14-year-old Oliver is currently following in Samantha’s footsteps into modern pentathlon.
Where did you go to school and was sport an important part of your school life?
I went to Bowland High at Grindleton, near to my home town of Clitheroe in the Ribble Valley. It was a lovely school. Everyone knew I was very sporty, but sport in schools then was probably even less competitive than it is now in state schools. It was more about getting everyone involved in a range of activities.
I enjoyed sport at school, but I did most of my serious sport at clubs and I thought of the sport that I did at school as just for fun. It was certainly more enjoyable than a maths lesson!
How did your career develop at school? Did you excel at other sports?

I tried lots of different sports, both at school but particularly at some local clubs. I ran at the inter-schools cross-country championships, winning them five years in a row, and I played netball for the school and the county.
I was horse riding from a very young age – my grandmother keeps horses. I also swam at galas, played rounders, tennis, netball and football, while I had a tomboy stage.
I’d like to think doing so many different sports at an early age helped lead me to what is probably one of the ultimate multi-sport events, modern pentathlon.
Your most memorable sporting moment as a schoolgirl?
I remember playing in the semi-finals of a local short tennis tournament in Blackburn when I was about 10 or 11. I lost because the other girl was better than me, but I remember feeling a sense of despair and disappointment that I’d lost. I got in the car feeling very sorry for myself and wanting to go back for another tennis lesson so I could do better next time.
Did sport interfere with your school work?
I think sport helped me at school. I was always a very active girl at school and I always had lots of energy. Sport gave me a way of channelling that energy.
I did a lot of sports until the pressures of exams came along, but I had to cut back on things a bit when I was doing my GCSEs and A-levels.
I’m sure sport helped me to focus on the academic side of the things when I was back in the classroom, and that helped me to do well and to get into a good university. Last year I graduated with a French and Politics degree from the University of Bath.
Who inspired you as a schoolgirl?
My grandmother and mother have always been the main inspirations and role models in my life. My grandmother, Sylvia Butler, has a farm with horses and is a riding instructor. She is loving and kind, she wears a smile on her face and has encouraged me. That’s possibly always given me a positive attitude towards challenges.
My mother, Deborah, is very structured, organised and hard working. I’ve learned a lot from both of them.
Are we delivering sport in the right way in schools and what would you change?
I can only really speak for state schools. In my experience if you’re not really good at netball or football are branded as non-sporting, and that’s simply not true. There’s a sport out there for everybody.
It’s important that state schools are funded well enough and have enough staff to provide children with as much experience of as many different sports as possible.
David Cameron has said he wants to push competitive sport in state schools and that’s a fabulous idea. Sport builds confidence and helps people learn about themselves. It exposes people to the sort of competitive environment they can expect in their working lives.
What advice would you give to schoolchildren who are interested in pursuing a career in sport?
I’d advise every young person who’s enjoying sport to contact local sports clubs and go and give everything a go, even if you only try it once. You may have a talent for something you really didn’t expect. Go to an athletics club and try lots of different events, sit on a horse, hold a hockey stick, swim or play tennis to see whether you like it or not.
