The original World Cup Group of Death in Mexico lacked for nothing in 1986

Sometimes a picture only needs to speak three words. When the TV cameras cut to FA Chairman Greg Dyke drawing his finger across his throat in Costa do Sauipe, Brazil in December, the inference was clear. England had just been drawn against Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica in the World Cup and there is a name for groups like that. Now after two games, England know all about the unique peril of being in a Group of Death.
It has become a cliché to say that every World Cup has one. Every World Cup claims to have one, but the modern system of seedings based on geographical restrictions and the spurious Fifa world rankings mean the label is largely divorced from reality.
It originated among local journalists at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico for the group containing Brazil, England, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Its popularisation however started in 1986, at the second Mexico World Cup. Group E clubbed together West Germany, Uruguay, Scotland and Denmark, a group to be contested in the high altitude and searing heat of Queretaro and Nezahualcóyotl.
The Uruguayan coach Omar Borras came out and called it precisely what it was – El grupo de le muerte, the Group of Death. This time the phrase went global, and has remained in the lexicon of football ever since. Unlike later editions of the World Cup, in 1986 you could believe the hype. The group was beautifully balanced, a perfect storm of talent, history and momentum.
Scotland looked to have an uphill task in the group but were a serious proposition for their opponents. The New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United had taken their domestic game to its competitive high watermark and the squad was also loaded with players regularly landing English and European trophies. Alex Ferguson, who had taken over after the death of Jock Stein in the aftermath of the final qualifier against Wales, had brought what Graeme Souness called ‘the best prepared Scottish squad there has ever been’ to Mexico.

Denmark were making their World Cup debut and had under the expert guidance of Sepp Piontek emerged from decades in the international wilderness. They had fired a warning shot with an agonising near miss at the 1984 European Championship but their status as newcomers meant they had been in the lowest seeding group alongside Canada, Iraq and others. They were guaranteed a tough draw, but they were also the loose cannon that no one wanted to be in the firing line of.
Between them Uruguay and West Germany had won a third of all the World Cups staged to that point. West Germany were in a state of transition with Franz Beckenbauer in charge of trying to put the wheels back on, taking over after a rare failure at the 1984 European Championship. When recalling years later the names of his players in his 1986 squad Beckenbauer broke down laughing. Nevertheless, this was a tournament and they were West Germany.
Uruguay entered the tournament as South American champions. After a 12 year hiatus they returned to the World Cup as one of the hot favourites along with Brazil and Argentina, and were a potent force again. Force would be an integral part of their game plan, as a gifted generation of players lost the plot for a month and marked their stay in Mexico with red mist and red cards.
The warning signs were there after the opening game of the group, Uruguay versus West Germany in Queretaro. A sloppy back pass from Lothar Matthäus released Antonio Alzamendi on the German goal, where he rounded goalkeeper Harald Schumacher and clubbed his shot in off the crossbar after only four minutes. Uruguay remained occasionally incisive in attack, but defended their advantage with a systematic and cynical series of body checks, fouls and outright assaults. Surprisingly only two Uruguayan players were booked, and the famous West German resilience came to the fore when Klaus Allofs smuggled in the equaliser six minutes from the end.
The Uruguayan defender Victor Diogo, who could have had a straight red card for a thundering foul on Thomas Berthold, said of it afterwards: "I will do it again. I’ve come to Mexico to win the World Cup. And I will do everything for my country." Many a player has expressed the desire to do literally anything to win a game of football, but few have been as committed to that premise as the Uruguayans in 1986. After the match Fifa dispatched a letter to the Uruguayan FA to warn them about their conduct; the letter was treated as seriously as junk mail.
Later that day in Nezahualcóyotl, Denmark and Scotland played out the last match of the opening phase of group games. By common consensus, it was the best of what had been seen in Mexico to that point. ‘My advice to youngsters who love the game and want to be strikers who storm the opposing goal would be to go to Denmark or Scotland,’ cooed no less a cerebral figure than Cesar Luis Menotti afterwards. The game itself was settled by a solitary strike from Preben Elkjær, the enigmatic and brilliant Danish forward playing with Verona in Serie A. Sizing up his marker Willie Miller, he simply ran through him and accelerated into the area to clip a low, left-footed shot past Jim Leighton to win the game.
Elkjær and the Danes would seduce the watching world in the opening weeks of Mexico 86. Everything about them was refreshing and life affirming – their dazzling football, happy disposition, their eccentric manager and that striking Hummel kit. There was steel behind all the smiles though; as Charlie Nicholas threatened to get away from him and advance to goal in the second half, the midfielder Klaus Berggreen hacked him down with a brutal foul that saw Nicholas carried from the field. "I did it for Denmark," Berggreen recalled years later. The Uruguayans weren’t the only patriots prepared to take a walk on the dark side in the Group of Death.
The defeat put Scotland on the back foot as they prepared to face West Germany. Unknown to the Scots, Beckenbauer had decided to get the inside track on their preparations. The Scottish training camp was closed off, but Beckenbauer’s assistant Berti Vogts found a worker from a drinks company sponsoring the World Cup and obtained his uniform in exchange for a replica West Germany shirt. He later confessed this rouse to Craig Brown, his opposite number in the Scotland camp. "He had the white apron on, and went in with a hat," recalls Brown. "He pretended he was setting up his stall, and all the time he was watching Scotland training."
Whatever Vogts reported back it was of little use initially, as Scotland took the lead after a deflected strike from the busy Gordon Strachan flew past Schumacher. ‘When I was walking back to the halfway line,’ Strachan remembered in a television interview, ‘I was thinking, “My dad will be jumping about the golf club now with his mates. He’ll be steaming before the night’s out!”’ Strachan sadly couldn’t start the jumping in Queretaro. When he arrived at the advertising hoardings he wanted to hurdle them as other goal scorers had in the tournament, but quickly realised he was too short to do so.
Scotland played well, but inevitably West Germany came from behind to salvage the situation again. Allofs and Rudi Völler were a constant menace an each set up a goal for the other to win the match 2-1, not that this impressed Beckenbauer. ‘We won and that’s about the best thing I can say about the game’ he said afterwards. As unimpressed as Beckenbauer was with almost every aspect of his Mexican experience, this tournament did see Thomas Berthold, Andy Brehme, Matthäus and Völler start World Cup matches for the first time. His 1990 tournament winners forged their base in Mexico.
Back in Nezahualcóyotl Piontek was preparing his team to face Uruguay. With the tackles likely to be arriving hard and in number, Piontek advised his players to ease up on the dribbling and move the ball quickly. ‘And what they did,’ remembers the Danish TV commentator Svend Gehrs, ‘was dribble more than ever.’ It didn’t go over well at all. Denmark were already an Elkjær goal to the good when the already booked Miguel Bossio vented some of the Uruguayan frustration with a scything hack at Frank Arnesen and was promptly sent off.
What followed was an exhilarating slaughter. The dynamic Søren Lerby broke from midfield to add a second for Denmark before Enzo Francescoli bought the cheapest of penalties and converted it himself to give Uruguay a glimmer of hope. Early in the second half the precocious Michael Laudrup picked up the ball twenty yards from goal and glided effortlessly through the Uruguayan defence and around the goalkeeper to score one of the greatest goals in the 1986 World Cup.
On the Uruguayan side Jorge da Silva’s head went at this point, and he launched into a sickening stamp on Denmark’s holding midfielder Jens Jørn Bertelsen. The assault put Bertelsen out of the rest of the group phase, and he was barely fit when the knockout stages began. Incredibly, da Silva wasn’t even cautioned. Retributive justice followed; Denmark had been training so intensely – some in the squad felt overly so – that they were at their absolute peak in the group stages. They taunted, teased and then finished their opponents in style, with Elkjær securing a hat-trick and Jesper Olsen of Manchester United adding another in a rousing 6-1 victory. ‘If we could have beaten them 10-1 we would have done,’ Berggreen says. ‘We couldn’t stop. It was our way of playing.’
It was, quite simply, breathtaking. "Have you got any idea what the world will say if we beat Uruguay, the South American champions?" Piontek had asked his players before the game. The world duly swooned, the neutrals had new darlings and Denmark were now being bracketed among the favourites to lift the World Cup. They were making such light work of the Group of Death that they were in the unique position of being able to chop and change players at their leisure for a World Cup match with West Germany. They could even, if they chose to, weigh up the alternatives of altitude and opponents for the second round and play for a result accordingly.
Denmark wouldn’t entertain this and neither, given their mucky fingers from a similar incident with Austria at the previous World Cup, would West Germany. As both teams were already qualified for the second round they rested players threatened by injury and suspension, but this dead rubber was vibrant and full of life. Denmark won an open and attacking contest 2-0 with a Jesper Olsen penalty and then a beautiful team goal finished off by the substitute John Eriksen, which started from a chipped goal-kick.
With around thirty seconds of the game left, there was a dramatic late twist; Arnesen, who had been Denmark’s player of the tournament for many people including Piontek, was fouled by Matthäus. In the days leading up to the game he had been at the bedside of his wife, who had been seriously ill in Mexico. All of the on and off field pressure accumulated, he kicked out at Matthäus and was sent off. He would be a crucial component to lose for the second round match against Spain, where they would collapse to a shocking 1-5 defeat.
In the concurrent fixture in Nezahualcóyotl, Uruguay and Scotland met to decide third place in the group, which would be enough to qualify for the second round. Ferguson had already shown himself to be a man of direct action when he left Liverpool captain Alan Hansen out of the squad prior to the tournament, but he dropped an even greater bombshell when he left Souness out of the team to face Uruguay. On paper and reputation Souness was the perfect man to mix it with the Uruguayan midfielders, but he was out of form, 33 years old and struggling badly in the heat. Having lost over a stone going into the tournament through illness the power wasn’t there and he accepted what was coming. Souness had never been dropped in his career; Ferguson didn’t even put him on the bench.
In his autobiography Ferguson would later claim he felt his team selection was compromised by his connections to his Aberdeen players, and his pre-match team talk went off kilter after a row with the unselected Steve Archibald. Initially it didn’t seem like it would matter. After forty-eight seconds a merciless tackle from behind by José Batista on Gordon Strachan produced the quickest red card in World Cup history.
Now with a numerical advantage for the full game Scotland looked certain to win and qualify for the second round, the albatross that’s been hovering over their national squad for decades. What unfolded was nightmare. The French referee Joel Quiniou was never going to show another red card after handing one out so early, and was so cravenly and obviously intimidated it gave the remaining Uruguayans a free pass to get stuck into the Scottish players – and not just with tackles. "If there was a corner, they were pulling your hair," Jim Leighton told STV years later. "Pulling your privates, that kind of stuff. Spitting on you."
Despite this Scotland still had chances, the best of which was missed by the fullback Steve Nicol. They threw on Nicholas and Davie Cooper, but couldn’t score. At the other end, the Uruguayan out ball and token class act Francescoli turned in what Brown called ‘the greatest individual performance I have ever seen.’ The game finished goalless, and Uruguay advanced at Scotland’s expense.
They were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs by Fifa for their misdemeanours and threatened with expulsion from the tournament. After a post-match verbal assault on the referee in which he called him ’A murderer’, the Uruguayan manager Omar Borras was banished to the stands for the following game, which to no one’s regret they lost to Argentina. In his press conference Ferguson unloaded several barrels on the Uruguayans; it was SFA chief Ernie Walker who went the furthest, claiming ‘we were associated with the scum of world football.’
It was a grubby end, but Group E in Mexico had lacked for nothing. A heady cocktail of hype, cynicism, brilliance, drama and controversy, the Group of Death was a tournament within a tournament. Denmark won it and became famous, Uruguay became infamous and West Germany – inevitably – went to the final. For Scotland it became another chapter in their catalogue of World Cup heartbreak. "I tell you, I'm glad to go home, believe me," Ferguson said after the Uruguay game, "because it's no part of football."
The concept of the Group of Death however has become a ubiquitous part of football, and seemingly any sport using a group stage format. Whether it’s in a World Cup in football, rugby, cricket or anything else, they will have to go some to be the equal of El grupo de le muerte in Mexico in 1986.
