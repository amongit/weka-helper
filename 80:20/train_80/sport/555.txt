Vicente del Bosque’s side became the first international team to win three major tournaments in a row but with Xavi and Iker Casillas intending to carry on, the core of the side still not in their prime, and a generation of new stars in the making, they will surely be favourites to make it a fourth trophy in Brazil in 2014.
With the celebrations barely begun, Spain’s array of talent were already being asked if they could become the first European team to win the World Cup in South America? “We will try,” said Cesc Fabregas.
“Everyone thought we would be finished after the World Cup because we had won the Euros and the World Cup. They thought we might ease off a bit but here we are again, at the European Championship again, winners and we made the triple. No one has done that before in football and we are very proud of it.”
What will intimidate the rest of international football is that so many of Fabregas’s team-mates will still be in their late twenties for the next World Cup.
They have Sergio Busquets, still only 23, Jordi Alba, 23, Gerard Pique, 25, Andres Iniesta, 28, and Fabregas himself, who is just 25.

“We are mostly between 23 and 25. It’s really a thing to perform at the top level at that age, Fabregas said.
“We were lucky to live a lot of good experiences when we were a young age of 21. Hopefully that and the success we are having now will mean we are stronger for those experiences when we’re 27 and 29.
"The age says that we can keep going for many years but, at the same time, we will see how we arrive in Brazil.”
By then a new generation of players will be competing for a place in the squad. They are the European champions at under-21 level and their Olympic side is expected to compete with Brazil for gold in London. They also begin their defence of their European Under-19 title on Tuesday.
Thiago Alcantra, 21, Iker Muniain, 19, Isco, 20, and Martin Montoya, 21, have already been involved with the senior squad, adding even more depth of competition for places.
“They have to keep going,” Fabregas said of this new generation. “Xavi, Casillas and Carles Puyol have been going for 12 years. It’s not about them coming into a great team.
"They have to keep going, they have to take more responsibility. Take Jordi Alba, he’s played an amazing tournament, played an amazing game in the final and he is only 23 years-old.”
Not that there will be many spaces opening up. Xavi will be 34 by the time of the next World Cup but, after a superb performance in the final in Kiev, he has indicated he wants to carry on.
“Taking part in World Cup 2014?” If I feel good, I will be there,” he said. “I’ll talk with the coach, but in principle I’ll continue. We’ll see.”
Casillas will also carry on. He is still only 31 and as a goalkeeper could play for many years yet. He stressed, though, that the established players must respond to the challenge of the hungry younger generation.
“Time goes by for everyone,” he said. “As a goalkeeper I can carry on for a bit longer but there are people below us pushing us hard. In a couple of years there will be new players and although it is true that we have a great under-21 team, you have to unite that group and make it work.”
The success of almost all of Spain’s senior internationals in representative youth football is cited by Casillas as a reason why they have developed such a winning mentality as a group.
“We have got used to winning from a very young age,” Casillas said. “We won the under-16s, the under-19s, the under-20s.”
Spain cannot just win, though, they have to do so I style. Their final performance was a fitting riposte to those critics who had accused them of playing more negative football. Arsène Wenger even accused them of “betraying their philosophy” in the run up to the game.
Fabregas could not credit Wenger with that position, although he did reveal that his former Arsenal manager had doubted Spain’s ability to cope without the injured pair of David Villa and Carles Puyol.
“From Arsène? No,” he said on being told of Wenger’s criticisms. “Everyone sees it the way they want to but I think we played a fantastic game.
"I think we have been playing well the last four years. I spoke to Arsène a couple of weeks ago and he told me that without Villa and Puyol it could be decisive but we had some resources.
"Álvaro Arbeloa played, Sergio Ramos played an excellent tournament at the back, I played up front and when I didn’t, Fernando Torres did.”
Torres, who celebrated with his children on the pitch in Kiev, said the experience had helped him “leave behind” a season of frustration with Chelsea.
He said: “I will leave this behind, I will remember the three titles, with this final which was so beautiful for the team, the whole country and everyone who follows Spain, and I am sure the fans of Chelsea who will be happy.
"Now I have to rest and enjoy this and be ready for the next season which I am sure will be full of great moments. At least I have to think like that.
“It was a complicated season for me. It doesn’t mean it was bad, far from it, but it was complicated with very difficult moments for me.
"And to see my family happy after the match at the end, you see that whatever happened during the season is worth it. After a year which was so tough and complicated and during which we suffered so much it made it all worth it.”
