Alex Dowsett's Hour Record attempt is hanging in the balance after he fractured his collarbone in a training crash on Tuesday, his Movistar team have announced.
The Essex rider was out training on roads near his home when he came off his bike. Scans confirmed a fracture in his right collarbone, with surgery likely on Thursday.
Dowsett was due to go for the iconic Hour Record at London's Olympic velodrome on Feb 27, the same weekend as Dame Sarah Storey attempts to set a new mark in the women's event.
He was hoping to set a new mark for Sir Bradley Wiggins to aim at when the 2012 Tour de France champion has a crack at one of cycling's most iconic records in June.
The Hour Record has been reinvigorated in recent months, with the sport's governing body revising the rules, leading to a spate of record attempts.

Movistar said that a decision "on whether Dowsett's attempt will go on as planned or be postponed will be specified in the next few days, subject to medical examination after his surgery and Dowsett's own consideration".
A media day scheduled for Tuesday 20 at London's Lee Valley VeloPark has been cancelled.
"Thanks for all the kind messages guys, far from ideal timing but will bounce back asap," Dowsett tweeted, before joking that he might try to extract some sort of a performance advantage from the surgery. "May even ask the surgeons to take a couple of cm out of the other collarbone as well to make me Tom Dumoulin [a Dutch rider and noted time triallist] aero."
It is the second broken collarbone in the space of days for GB riders with Olympic gold medallist Steven Burke breaking his in a crash in Majorca on Sunday.
