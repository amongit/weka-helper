Carl Froch expects foul-play from Andre Ward
Britain's Carl Froch says he expects US opponent Andre Ward to be a "dirty" fighter during their Super Six super-middleweight final in Atlantic City on 29 October.
Nottingham's WBC title-holder adds he believes he can knock out Ward "in the first five or six rounds".
Froch had to beat Jermain Taylor, Andre Dirrell, Arthur Abraham and Glen Johnson to get to the final, as well as lose to Mikkel Kessler, while Ward has racked up wins against Kessler, Allan Green, Sakio Bika and Abraham.
