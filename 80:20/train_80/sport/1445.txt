Homophobic tweet sent to referee Nigel Owens investigated
A homophobic and abusive tweet sent to Welsh rugby referee Nigel Owens is being investigated by police.
Mr Owens was in charge of England's 55-35 Six Nations victory over France at Twickenham on Saturday.
South Wales Police said on its Twitter account it was investigating the tweet's content.
A spokesman told BBC Wales on Sunday that the matter has been passed on to Dyfed-Powys Police, the relevant investigating force.
Dyfed-Powys police has been asked to comment.
England's win over France was not enough to see them lift the Six Nations title as they needed a bigger points margin.
One person is missing and two others are taken to hospital following a fire which severely damaged a house in Swansea.
