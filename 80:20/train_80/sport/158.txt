Dale Coyne Racing signs Dracone, keeps Huertas
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Dale Coyne Racing has signed veteran open wheel driver Francesco Dracone for the first four races of the season.
The team hasn't set plans for the rest of the year for the No. 19 Honda, but also announced Monday that Carlos Huertas will drive the No. 18 for a second straight season.
Huertas won the Houston race last June as a rookie.
Dracone also drove in IndyCar for Conquest Racing in 2010. He'll spend two extra days at Barber Motorsports after the full-field testing scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.
The Italian driver has been competing in the Auto GP Series in Europe since then and is a 13-year open wheel veteran.
Dracone says: ''It is good to be back in America and great to be back in IndyCar.''
