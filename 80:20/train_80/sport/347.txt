Wrestling was reinstated to the programme on Sunday following its controversial axing in February and equally controversial involvement in a process that was designed to reward successful sports, not make an example of failing ones.
That is exactly what happened when it took just one round of voting for wresting to gain the outright majority needed to return to the Olympic fold, even though its margin of victory – 49 votes compared to 24 for baseball-softball and 22 for squash – was not as overwhelming as it had hoped.
IOC president Jacques Rogge, who is about to stand down, instituted a cap of 10,500 athletes and 28 sports for the summer Games but there are suggestions his successor – to be voted in on Tuesday – may raise this.
That gave hope to Sunday’s beaten sports, with World Squash Federation president Narayana Ramachandran saying: "As the only new Olympic sport on today’s shortlist, we believed squash offered something for the future and I still hope that our inclusion may still be possible.
"The feedback we have received from many IOC members for our campaign and our presentation has been very positive and I am encouraged by the vote we received. We have much to offer the Olympic movement and I am hopeful that today is not the end of our Olympic journey."

Wrestling has been an Olympic sport since ancient times and its place was never seriously under threat after it made changes demanded by the IOC to the sport and its governance.
Governing body Fila handed women and athletes a role in decision-making, it added two weight classes for women and it adopted rule changes to make the sport easier to understand and more fun to watch, rewarding more aggressive wrestling.
Its’ new president, Nenad Lalovic, described Sunday’s decision as "the most important day in the 3,000-year history of our sport".
"With this vote, you have shown that the steps we have taken to improve our sport have made a difference," he said. "I assure each of you that our modernisation will not stop now. We will continue to strive to be the best partner to the Olympic Movement that we can be."
IOC members have acknowledged that wrestling should not have been cut from the Games and Rogge said: "Wrestling has shown great passion and resilience in recent months."
Squash’s failure was its third in succession after it topped an IOC vote in 2005 for Olympic inclusion but failed to get the required two-thirds majority before falling short again in 2009.
Baseball and softball merged to try and get back on the Games programme, for which it was axed ahead of London 2012. The American co-president of the World Baseball Softball Confederation broke into tears when delivering a speech during Sunday’s final presentations.
