• Barcelona v Manchester City: as it happened • Five ways for England to improve in Europe
Barcelona
Marc-Andre Ter Stegen - A bystander for most of the game, but the German gave a Manuel Neuer-like performance as a sweeper-keeper, at one point almost being embarrassed by Aguero before saving penalty.
Dani Alves - Had nothing to do on a defensive basis, but embarrassed Vincent Kompany seven minutes in by pick-pocketing the City captain on the edge of the penalty area to create chance for Neymar.
Jordi Alba - The Spain left-back had nothing to do against Nasri in the first-half, but was forced to get involved when quick winger Jesus Navas came on at half-time.
Gerard Pique - Strolled through the game until the moment he conceded a penalty by tripping Aguero. Complained about lack of contact, but there was enough to take Aguero down.
Jeremy Mathieu - Shared the Aguero-marking duties with Pique, but it was a part-time job because of the lack of service to the City forward. May have been different against the height of Edin Dzeko.
Ivan Rakitic - The Croatian midfielder goes under the radar in a team of stars, but he was excellent alongside Mascherano and scored a wonderful goal to cap his performance.
Javier Mascherano - Restored to midfield in the absence of the injured Sergio Busquets and it was a change which made Barca stronger. So composed and alert in front of the back four.
Andres Iniesta - Exposed the folly of Pellegrini’s four-man midfield by making himself the spare man in the centre of the pitch. Given free rein to dictate the game for Barca.
Lionel Messi - At his mesmerising best, particularly in a first-half when he nut-megged Fernandinho and James Milner, as well as creating Rakitic’s goal with a stunning cross-field pass.
Luis Suarez - A constant menace, but not quite as devastating as in the first-leg, when his two goals won the game. Hit the post with a first-half lob, but could not go any closer after the break.
Neymar - Faded in the second-half after a bright first-half which saw him torment Sagna and hit the post early on. Doesn’t look overly content to be playing on the left wing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manchester City
Joe Hart - Exposed time and again by his defenders, but the England keeper stood up well to the test and produced a series of crucial saves to spare his team a heavy defeat.
Bacary Sagna - Surprisingly selected ahead of Pablo Zabaleta, the French full-back was given a torrid time by Neymar and went walkabout when Messi crossed for Rakitic to score.
Vincent Kompany - Started terribly by losing possession to Dani Alves on edge of penalty area and struggled to regain composure, which was understandable against Barca’s attacking might.
Martin Demichelis - The Argentine rode his luck early on with some risky challenges, particularly on Suarez, but settled down to bring some sense of stability to City’s rocky back four.
Aleksandar Kolarov - Booked for a cynical body-check on Messi which left him walking a tightrope, but the Serbian kept his head and attempted to offer City an attacking outlet down the left.
Fernandinho - Booked early on, the Brazilian was left to stem an incessant tide of Barcelona attacks with Yaya Toure regularly abandoning his post alongside him.
Yaya Toure - The Ivorian was booked for a reckless foul on Suarez 20 yards and the incident summed up his first-half. Made a better contribution after the interval when pushed further forward by Pellegrini.
James Milner - Found himself trending worldwide on Twitter, but only because he was nutmegged by Messi. It was a good one, though – one to show the grandkids.
Samir Nasri - Hugely fortunate to escape a red card for a stupid, petulant first-half foul on Neymar. Usual sloppy Champions League performance before being replaced at half-time.
David Silva - Booked for first-half foul on Messi, the Spaniard grew into the game in the second-half and gave Aguero more support, but it was ultimately another Champions League game that passed him by.
Sergio Aguero - City’s talisman went into this game with eleven goals in his last ten Champions League games, but he was left so isolated he was probably shot to pieces by the time he missed his late penalty.
Substitutions:
Wilfried Bony for Toure 70 - Given late chance to save the game ahead of Dzeko.
Jesus Navas for Nasri 46 - Made a difference after replacing Nasri. Gave City width and tested Barcelona defence.
Lampard for Milner 86 - Brief farewell to Champions League stage for Lampard.
