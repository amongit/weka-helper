Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 Edge: What's the difference?

| Image 1 of 7

Samsung has finally unveiled its long-awaited and much-rumored flagship smartphone. Well, two smartphones to be accurate. Joining the standard Galaxy S6 is the Galaxy S6 Edge that features a dual-curve display.
First, let's take a look at the basics:
But these are just the bare specs, let's take a deeper look at some of the changes.
Availability: April 10.

Got stuff to do, you're in a hurry and your smartphone is almost flat? The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge features a fast charge function that gives you 4 hours of usage from a 10-minute charge.
The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge also feature wireless charging, supporting WPC and PMA standards, as well as offering support for Qi-enabled chargers.
One downside is that you'll have to purchase the wireless charging pad separately, which is a bit of a rub.

As well has having a larger f1.9 aperture front and rear camera – which should dramatically help low-light performance – Samsung has worked on making the camera faster to access. Samsung claims that you can launch the camera in 0.7 seconds no matter whether you are using the smartphone or it is locked.

Both the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge are equipped with a 5.1-inch 2,560×1,440 (QHD resolution) Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 577 ppi.

With the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung has moved away from plastic to adopt a seamless, full metal and glass construction. The glass comes in the form of the highly durable Gorilla Glass 4, and the glass has been treated with a special reflective material on the inside to give it a highly jeweled finish.

The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will be offered in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum options, along with a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald for the Galaxy S6 Edge.

The upsides:
The downsides:
Samsung has decided to split its flagship smartphone into two models - the standard Galaxy S6, and the Galaxy S6 Edge. But what is it exactly that separates these two devices?
Let's start with the obvious - the Galaxy S6 Edge's curve on the edge of the screen which can be used to present information in cool (gimmicky?) ways. Features such as "Information Stream," "Night Clock," "Edge Lighting," and "People Edge" make use of the curved edge as secondary displays. Some of these features are already present on the Note Edge.

Is this useful to you? Only you can answer that. Personally, I think some interesting stuff might come of this if/when it is ever opened up to third-party developers (assuming there's enough interest in the S6 Edge to attract developer attention).
Like fine wine, BlackBerry Passport gets better with age
After using the BlackBerry Passport for five months, Matthew is more impressed with it than with any other phone in his collection.
Other than the fact that the display extends over the edge on the S6 Edge, the two devices share exactly the same display spec. Both feature a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED panel with a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels and a pixel density of 577 pixels per inch.
On the dimensions front, there are some minimal differences between the two handsets:
The bigger display on the S6 Edge has resulted in Samsung giving it a slightly larger battery:
Both are smaller than the 2800mAh battery capacity of the Galaxy S5.
On the processor front, the S6 and the S6 Edge share the same silicon, an Exynos 7420 SoC built using 14-nanometer architecture. It features an octa-core 64-bit (4 x 2.1GHz cores and 4 x 1.5GHz cores) along with a Mali-T760 GPU. Both have 3GB of RAM and come in 32/64/128GB storage options.
On the design front, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will be offered in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum options, along with a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald for the Galaxy S6 Edge.
Everything else is the same... until we come down to price. European prices suggest that the S6 Edge will command a premium in the region of $100.
If the price difference were a few bucks it would be easier to take a gamble on the curved screen being useful (or at least offering something in the way of bragging rights), but if the price is too high (and the benefits too tenuous) then it makes it easier to overlook.
