Tech specs: Apple's new MacBook | ZDNet
Apple has added a new MacBook to its lineup. The company claims that this offers a full-sized Mac experience in the thinnest and lightest form so far.In order to make the new MacBook as thin as possible, Apple has had to reinvent the keyboard, dispensing with the traditional - and wobbly - butterfly mechanism with a new butterfly mechanism. The redesigned keys on the new MacBook feature a larger surface area, a thinner construction, and a deeper curvature, but are 40 percent thinner.Each key also features its own LED backlight, which not only allowed the keyboard to be thinner, but also allowed more uniform lighting.
