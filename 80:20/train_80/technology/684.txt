Free tool simplifies Azure migration between data centers
In yesterday's Microsoft Azure Blog, Guy Bowerman, Senior Program Manager, Azure Compute Runtime, highlighted the availability of a free, open source tool design to assist users in moving existing, deployed virtual machines from one Azure data center to another.
The 21st Century Data Center
More than ever, data centers run the world, but many of them need a 21st century reboot. Todayâ€™s data centers have to be more efficient, redundant, and flexible than ever. We examine when and how to best run your own data center versus when to outsource to the cloud or a service provider, and when to take a hybrid approach.
The Azure Data Center Migration Solution (ADCMS) is designed to address common migration scenarios, such as moving to a closer data center with lower latency; deploying the same solution configuration to multiple data centers; or even moving between subscriptions, such as from an MSDN test account to a full production deployment.
The software was tested under a variety of different scenarios including:
The appendix of the application user guide includes information on the performance of the migration in each of the scenarios, giving the user a ballpark idea how long their own migration might take. The automated migration also required the manual migration of Blobs related to the VMs being migrated, and the time required for that process is included in the performance analyses.
The complete open source product is available on github along with the comprehensive user manual. Microsoft, and developer Persistent Systems who created the tool along with the Microsoft Azure CAT team in Bangalore, India, expect that end users will be able to easily modify the source code to meet the needs of their specific project and requirements for the migration tool.
