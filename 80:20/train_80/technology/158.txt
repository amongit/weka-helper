Leading ServiceNow partner acquires European presence
Chicago-based Fruition Partners has acquired Partners in IT in the United Kingdom, in a move that brings together two high-level ServiceNow cloud integrators and extends Fruition's footprint globally.
Together, the two solution providers employ approximately 300 service experts who have skills in the ServiceNow approach to IT service management (ITSM). The combined company plans to retain its existing offices and teams, with Partners in IT founder and managing director Paul Cash reporting to Fruition CEO Marc Talluto.
Enterprise cloud outlook: Inevitably hybrid, surprisingly agile and (eventually) cheap
"Partners in IT has similar growth ambitions to Fruition Partners and recognizes that the opportunity is greater for the two organizations working together," Cash said in a statement about the acquisition.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but the transcation closed on the day that it was announced, July 1, 2014.
Fruition Partners is a Master-level ServiceNow: it was one of the first integrators to earn that elite status. (The other one was Cloud Sherpas.) Its first foray outside the United States came earlier this year through a service delivery partnership with VSI that is initially focused on Colombia, Mexico and Brazil.
Partners in IT, founded in 1996 and based in Bracknell, England, specializes in ITSM and structured workflows. It is a UK Preferred Service Partner for ServiceNow, with a team of 50 people mostly focused in the UK but with some presence in other European markets. Some of its publicly declared customers include Boots, Air Liquide, Siemens and Veolia Environmental Services.
