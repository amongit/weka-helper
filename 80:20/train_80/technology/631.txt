Obliterase obliterates your data in a good way
The Built in Spiceworks program is an initiative aimed at helping stealth mode and early-stage startup technology brands like Obliterase test and validate their products and services with a select group of IT professionals before public launch. Obliterase launched its app in the Spiceworks App Store as a fully integrated product.
Obliterase for Spiceworks is the app that's fully integrated into Spiceworks, but it's also a standalone application that performs Department of Defense grade data erasure.
"We’re breaking new ground as the first B2B technology startup to co-engineer and launch a seamless, fully integrated product within Spiceworks," said Steve Wood, Obliterase CEO and board member of the World Computer Exchange. "Our integrated security solution is now available through the Spiceworks App Center, making it easy for organizations to destroy their data and meet regulatory compliance like HIPAA without leaving Spiceworks."
Obliterase offers a Home Edition ($29.99), a Small Business Edition ($59.99), an Enterprise Edition ($89.99), and Obliterase for Spiceworks (Monthly Subscription). For all but the Spiceworks integrated product, you purchase a limited number of data wipes.*
In its complete form (Enterprise Edition or Spiceworks integrated), Obliterase offers the following features:
Obliterase (standalone) is delivered as an ISO file that you burn to a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive and the boot your system to it to select the drive you wish to wipe.
I haven't used Obliterase yet, so I can't report on how effective or how easy it is to use. The free trial is for Spiceworks and I don't currently have it running. My Spiceworks system was decommissioned a few weeks ago (Sad face). I have used other similar products such as DBAN and liked it quite well. DBAN is very good, but has its limitations. Blancco products are more versatile than DBAN is and cover a wider range of platforms.
It appears, from the FAQ, that Obliterase only works on Windows and Linux-based computers. Sorry Mac types, you're out of luck.
There's one thing that separates Obliterase from the competition however: The Spiceworks community vetted Obliterase. What do I mean by that, you ask? Well, Spiceworks has an active user community that exceeds 6 million worldwide IT pros. If a large community like that says that an application is good enough to be integrated with Spiceworks, then there's a good chance you're going to love the product too.
U.S. government becomes 'biggest buyer' of malware
Amid a growing battle between federal government agencies and hackers, cyberwarriors, and cyber-enemy nation states, the U.S. is ramping up its malware stockpile to 'hack back' at those who attack it.
If you're aware of any community of IT pros, you know that they don't hold back or edit themselves when testing a product. There's no shortage of rancid commentary if something doesn't work as advertised. My point is that, if a product can survive the Spiceworks community vetting process, it's a darn good product and you should try it.

*Aren't you glad we don't purchase certain paper products that way. I'm just saying.
