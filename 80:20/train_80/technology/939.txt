AWS EC2 instances hit by datacentre power loss
Amazon's North Virginia region is experiencing problems, with problems occurring in the cloud's Elastic Compute, Relational Database Service and Elastic Beanstalk technologies.
MB263145127 Problems began at 8.50pm PDT on Thursday (4.50AM GMT Friday) in Elastic Compute(EC2) instances in a single availability zone — datacentre — in Amazon's US-East-1 region after part of the facility lost power.
"As a result of the power outage tonight in the US-East-1 region, some EBS volumes may have inconsistent data," Amazon wrote on the AWS status page at 12.11am PDT. "As we bring volumes back online, any affected volumes will have their status in the 'Status Checks' column in the Volume list in the console listed as 'Impaired.'"
As of 8.50am GMT, Amazon said it was working to "bring affected volumes back online", and said it should be able to recover them "within the next hour".
