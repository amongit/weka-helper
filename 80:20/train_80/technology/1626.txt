Google backtracks on 'explicit' Blogger content ban | ZDNet
Google has reversed the decision to ban explicit sexual content on Blogger. On Friday, in an update by Social Product Support Manager Jessica Pelegio on Google's Product Forums, the tech giant said in light of feedback and concern relating to the "retroactive enforcement of the new policy," which would impact on bloggers who have held accounts for over 10 years, Google has reversed its decision to ban explicit content entirely from the network. In addition, Pelegio said the reversal was due in part to the potential "negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities." Instead, Google will "step up enforcement" around an existing policy which prohibits commercial porn. Earlier this week, the online search giant informed users of the Blogger network who ran blogs behind an "adult content warning" page that all adult blogs would be removed from the public eye on March 23, 2015, leaving access only granted to registered users. The notice to Bloggers behind the "adult" door read: See also: Google bans 'explicit' adult content from Blogger blogs In order to prevent their blogs from being removed from the public arena, users were told to delete "sexually explicit or graphic nude images or video." According to ZDNet's Violet Blue, blogs under the "adult" label are wide-ranging, and include LGBT diaries, transgender activists, romance book writers, sex toy reviewers, art nude photographers and sex news blogs, among others. Therefore, should Google have gone ahead with the ban, it would not only be "standard" adult blogs which faced removal -- but a wide variety of community members and functions. Google says that blog owners should continue to mark blogs which contain explicit content as "adult" so they can be placed behind a suitable "adult content" warning on the network.
