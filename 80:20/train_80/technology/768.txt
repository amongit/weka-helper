Samsung has finally unveiled its long-awaited and much-rumored flagship smartphone. Well, two smartphones to be accurate. Joining the standard Galaxy S6 is the Galaxy S6 Edge that features a dual-curve display.
First, let's take a look at the basics:
But these are just the bare specs, let's take a deeper look at some of the changes.

Got stuff to do, you're in a hurry and your smartphone is almost flat? The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge features a fast charge function that gives you 4 hours of usage from a 10-minute charge.
The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge also feature wireless charging, supporting WPC and PMA standards, as well as offering support for Qi-enabled chargers.
One downside is that you'll have to purchase the wireless charging pad separately, which is a bit of a rub.

As well has having a larger f1.9 aperture front and rear camera – which should dramatically help low-light performance – Samsung has worked on making the camera faster to access. Samsung claims that you can launch the camera in 0.7 seconds no matter whether you are using the smartphone or it is locked.

Both the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge are equipped with a 5.1-inch 2,560×1,440 (QHD resolution) Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 577 ppi.

With the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung has moved away from plastic to adopt a seamless, full metal and glass construction. The glass comes in the form of the highly durable Gorilla Glass 4, and the glass has been treated with a special reflective material on the inside to give it a highly jeweled finish.

The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will be offered in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum options, along with a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald for the Galaxy S6 Edge.

The upsides:
The downsides:
Thinking of picking up a new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphone once it's out? Better start saving those pennies because it's going to cost you more than an iPhone.
While there's no official pricing as yet, the carrier T-Mobile accidentally let the cat out of the bag as part of its terms and conditions of a giveaway.
The price is listed as $699, which is likely for the lowest-capacity 32GB version.

Given this, on-contract pricing is likely to be around $200.
A 16GB iPhone 6 starts at $649, but that only has 16GB of storage, which these days really isn't enough unless you're a business user or not planning to use it much. Bumping that to a 64GB iPhone 6 adds $100 to the price.
Whether you buy the Galaxy S6 off-contract and swallow the whole cost in one go, or buy it on-contract and have it spread over the period of the contract, it's still a hefty price tag, and psychologically people are going to notice the starting price more than they're going to notice the capacity.
Joining the standard Galaxy S6 is the Galaxy S6 Edge which features a dual-curve display and is expected to cost more than the uncurved S6 handset.
