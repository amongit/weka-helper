An inventor in the US has proposed a new type of microwave that allows users to see when their food is cooked.
Former Nasa engineer Mark Rober wants to create a microwave fitted with an infrared camera in the ceiling.
A thermal map of the interior would then appear on the microwave's screen, allowing consumers to see when their food has been cooked through.
BBC Click spoke to him about how the proposed invention would work and how it might be used in the future as part of a more connected world.
