Dimension Data adds dedicated network connections for private cloud
For businesses that don't want to rely on the public Internet to access its cloud and managed hosting services, systems integrator Dimension Data has created a dedicated Cloud Private Network Connection offering.
There are two options for the new service:
The services are designed to sidestep any potential unreliabilty that could arise from unpredictable Internet connections. Wide area network performance is often an obstacle to the migration of production systems or applications into cloud environments, but these network offerings ameliorate that concern, said Gerard Florian, director of product management at Dimension Data.
The announcement follows the appointment last month of a new executive to lead the company's Americas cloud services business, Tina Gravel, who previously has held positions with Nirvanix and Terremark, a Verizon company. In her new role, Gravel will become the Dimension Data Americas vice president and general manager, cloud services.
To help support an "acceleration" of cloud services adoption, the integrator added four new data centers to its MCP footprint during 2013 bringing the total number of locations to 11. (The sites include Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, London, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Santa Clara, Calif., and two in Ashburn, Va.)
