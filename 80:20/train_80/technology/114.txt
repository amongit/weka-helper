HTC One: Lock and load, it's enterprise ready
In October, HTC posted its first loss in Q3 at NT$2.97 billion (US$101 million) for the three months ended September, partly due to amid intensifying competition and rising costs , partly from making its flagship handset HTC One. It's bracing for a challenging holiday season, forecasting sales to be lower in Q4 than the previous three months.
Its plans to revive the company's fortunes include plugging the gaps it had been neglecting particulraly in the mid and low-end tiers, said Chialin Chang, CFO of HTC, during an earnings call earlier this month.
HTC has also been continuing to promote its high-end products too. Earlier this week, it launched a marketing campaign on a display in New York's Times Square to highlight its smartphones, including a eye-catching 24K gold HTC One. According to Tong, a similar promotion will be held in Taipei during Christmas and New Year holidays, according to the United Daily News.
