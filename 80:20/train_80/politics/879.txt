Jeb Bush Scrambles 2016 GOP Field - US News
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's announcement that he is considering a run for president in 2016 scrambles the potential Republican field and crystallizes the internal party rift that probably will make choosing a GOP nominee both protracted and polarizing.
Bush, 61, certainly has an excellent political pedigree. He is the son of one former president, George H.W. Bush, and brother of another, George W. Bush, and he was the popular two-term governor of a big state. But the fact that there is no sudden rush within the GOP to Bush's side shows how fractured the party is, divided among social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party conservatives, national security hawks, libertarians, establishment Republicans, and those who want a Washington outsider in the White House.

Many GOP strategists interpreted Bush's announcement as a signal that he will definitely run. He released his announcement on Facebook, considered to be evidence that he will create a tech-savvy campaign and won't be bound by past conventions.
Some Republican operatives, especially Bush fans, say he has now transformed the race and will soon leap to the lead in the opinion polls on the Republican side.
This may be premature.
Many Republicans donors welcomed the news because they consider Bush a mature, predictable, conservative leader, GOP strategists say. But it's yet to be determined how much money these donors will really give to the former Florida governor.
Other potential candidates don't seem worried. "The more the merrier," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told reporters. And GOP strategists point out that many conservatives oppose Bush's polices on illegal immigration, which they consider too lenient, and education, which they say relies too heavily on the federal government, so he has a lot of explaining to do to GOP activists. Bush also hasn't run for office in a dozen years, and he may be rusty.
Just as important, Bush's business dealings, including private equity ventures, will now be under more scrutiny than ever, and sources close to the Bush family tell me he has become a rich man. This could lead him to suffer the same criticism that hurt Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012--that he is an out-of-touch Brahmin with little understanding of the middle class or the poor.
And there is the dynasty problem. If he won the presidency, he would be the third member of the Bush family to hold that office. In a campaign, he would be in the position of constantly being asked to defend the controversial policies of his father, who angered conservatives by increasing taxes, and his brother, who launched unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
If Hillary Clinton runs for the Democratic presidential nomination, as expected, the dynasty question would be even more prominent. She is the spouse of former President Bill Clinton. She also has strong ties to the administration of President Barack Obama, whom she served as secretary of state.

An indication of the fractured Republican field came with the release of a new McClatchy-Marist poll Monday. The survey indicated that if Romney ran again, he would have the support of 19 percent of Republicans and people who lean Republican, while Bush would get 14 percent; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee would each draw 9 percent. If Romney doesn't run, Bush's total increases to 16 percent, followed by Huckabee with 12 and Christie with 10. This means Bush would be a serious contender but not the dominant candidate.
In his announcement Tuesday, Bush said he discussed a possible run with his wife Columba during the Thanksgiving holiday period. "As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for president of the United States," Bush wrote. "In January, I also plan to establish a Leadership PAC (political action committee) that will help me facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation." His posting concluded, "I'll be in touch soon. Onward."
