Delhi elections: Congress to release list of 45 candidates on Wednesday
New Delhi: The Congress has finalised the list of 45 candidates for the Delhi Assembly elections and the names would be announced on Wednesday, said Congress Campaign Committee head for Delhi elections Ajay Maken.
Talking to mediapersons on Tuesday, Maken said corruption was a major issue in the Delhi Assembly elections.
He said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) might be trusted but not tested. "So, I appeal to the people of Delhi to vote for the tested party (Congress)," he said.
On former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, he said she herself had expressed the desire not to contest the elections.
Congress spokesperson PC Chacko said Dikshit would be actively involved in the campaigning.
He informed that the party has constituted a 101-member campaign committee for Delhi elections which would be led by Maken.
Chacko also sought to clarify that the Congress did not endorse supporting any party in the elections.
