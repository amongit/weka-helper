Cover Rape Like a Crime, Because It Is One
So sorry, Rolling Stone has brought journalism to a hard pass: how to cover stories of rape, especially those that happen on college campuses? The magazine's sensational account of a gang rape scene at a fraternity house crumbled under close scrutiny. The story relied on the alleged victim identified only as "Jackie." The writer did not contact any of the young men that she accused as her attackers. The case never went to court. The editors apologized (twice) for poor journalistic judgment after they concluded (too late) that Jackie's account was not credible.
But look at it this way. Even with its flaws, her story struck a chord. As Julia Horowitz, the assistant managing editor of The Cavalier Daily, wrote in Politico Magazine: "Yes, the story was sensational. But even the most sensational story, it seems, can contain frightening elements of truth." As badly as the editors botched this story, the sense of urgency over sexual assault was and is real. The time is right and ripe to confront and perhaps change the fusty way journalists handle sexual assault. There is a mounting sense of crisis among young people, a churn and a debate that we in the news profession need to keep up with. Sexual assault is also high in the military, which recorded roughly 19,000 reports this year, a decrease from a whopping 26,000 in 2012. Many of these cases involve young women as well who may feel reluctant, deployed in a fort far from home or out on a ship, to report an abuser, especially if he's in her chain of command.

Let me suggest the following. Listen up, editors: at some point, rape reporting has to be done in daylight, with names, faces and voices. Geneva Overholser, a high priestess of newspaper journalism who recently stepped down as the director of the USC Annenberg School of Journalism, has said so for years. As she put it in a New York Times op-ed way back in 1989, "Does not our very delicacy in dealing with rape victims subscribe to the idea that rape is a crime of sex rather than the crime of brutal violence that it really is? Surely the sour blight of prejudice is best treated by being subjected to strong sunlight." For more justice and credibility, rape victims must tell their stories in a public forum. There is nothing to be ashamed of: Put it on the public record and break the silences that keep shame alive.
Further, the government is acting more decisively than it ever has. This spring, rape became a red-hot issue at 85 universities and colleges across the country as they came under a major federal investigation for how they handle cases of sexual violence. There are a lot of elite private and public institutions on that list, including Swarthmore College (my alma mater), Amherst College and the University of Chicago.
For now, college-age women remain as vulnerable in an atmosphere more highly charged with rape in the cultural conversation as ever before.

These attacks happen in a netherworld, a landscape beyond the reach of courts and newspapers. If the victim is a first-year student, she may not know where to turn for medical help or law enforcement. Her shame, secrecy and silence empower the perpetrators. They rely on a code of silence. The perpetrators depend on victims being stunned or shamed into silence, into not telling authorities, so they can carry on with impunity – a darker twist on sex and drugs and rock and roll. I believe the need to change the code extends to journalism, which fails to cover rape like any other violent crime. We should demystify the way we deal with rape, period.

If we dared to try the new method first proposed by Overholser, then society could see how commonplace rape is – hurting our own sisters, daughters, mothers, wives. It simply must come out into the open eventually and not be stigmatized as if by a medieval shroud. We can also get a clearer picture of the doers. Rolling Stone could have done a real public service by getting the truth straight on the record. Instead, the story is a cautionary one in how feeble and futile our notions are when it comes to reporting rape.
Remember, social silences empower victimizers, whether in public or private.
