After Record Surge, Abortion Restrictions Level Off in 2014
After a record surge between 2011 and 2013, the number of abortion restrictions passed by state legislatures leveled off in 2014. However, supporters of a woman’s right to an abortion have reason to worry that the relative slowdown in state abortion restrictions won’t last long.
In 2014, 15 states enacted 26 new abortion restrictions, according to a new report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy analysis organization that supports abortion access. That's down from the 70 measures enacted in 2013. The report notes that many states have shortened lawmaking sessions in even-numbered years and that legislatures in four states – including North Dakota and Texas, where lawmakers tend to be among the toughest on abortion access – were not even in session in 2014.

Since the Republican statehouse wave of 2010, 231 abortion restrictions have been passed and enacted by state lawmakers. By 2014, 27 states had four or more types of abortion restrictions on their books, with 18 of those states having six or more. Laws passed have included bans on abortion after certain points in a pregnancy; regulations mandating that clinics meet certain structural requirements; limits on the use of medication abortion; waiting period and counseling requirements; and restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion. Many of these restrictions have been challenged in courts.
“The fact that we usually see a higher number of abortion restrictions in the year after an election, that the November 2014 elections shifted some state legislatures further to the right, and the renewed energy around abortion in Congress indicates that abortion will be hotly debated in state legislatures this year,” Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues associate with the Guttmacher Institute, tells U.S. News in an email. “Some state legislatures already have abortion restrictions on the agenda including Texas, Tennessee, Wisconsin and South Carolina."
