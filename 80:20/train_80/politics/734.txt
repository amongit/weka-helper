Breaking Codes, Breaking Silences
"The Imitation Game" is the saddest story told at the box office all year.
Benedict Cumberbatch is the lead actor, playing the British mathematician Alan Turing, in a brilliant ensemble of dramatic talent, including Keira Knightley. This true story’s power comes from knowing it happened and changed the course of history. It is as improbable as life can be, with a tragic personal twist.
Turing leads a small team in a huge night-and-day effort, racing to break the German Enigma code. The time is World War Two. The place is Bletchley Park, a fine country house the British government has provided to spur the project along.

The stakes were as high as they can be. The Germans were winning the fight in the air and on the high seas. Perplexed and stumped for two years, Turing realizes they can’t break the complex code without some little slip or clue from the German military operators. The British government, all the way up to Winston Churchill, is pressing for answers. Much depends on breaking Enigma with their own invention, a machine called Christopher.
Just why Turing names the machine Christopher opens a story arc back to the eccentric genius’s past. Turing’s first love as a schoolboy was named Christopher, a kind, bright boy who loved him back. They were “inseparable,” as the headmaster said.
To be a homosexual in that era was, in a way, to be doomed in a glass prison. It was against the law, meaning that gay men like Turing relied on keeping secrets and breaking codes in their private lives.
Richard Chamberlain, the English actor, told the New York Times in a recent interview, “When you grow up in the ‘30s, ‘40s and ‘50s being gay, it not only ain’t easy, it’s just impossible ... I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me.”

Turing’s team broke the remarkable code, penetrating the war room of Nazi Germany. But his own struggle was not over. After saving countless lives among the Allies, the price of his own became very steep. He didn’t get much of a thank you note from the free world.
The beauty of this sweeping movie lies not only in the acting, though we could save fuss and feathers and give Cumberbatch the Oscar right now. It reminds us how much can be told and taught in a true personal story. We humans like heartbreaking tragedy in thimblefuls.
Now we can relate more to those who lived under British law’s punishing stick. Thanks to a harrowing story in Rolling Stone, we are more apt to sympathize with victims of rape at the University of Virginia fraternities – and at other colleges. Anger at police violence, white on black, is as high as it’s ever been since it became crystallized in the death of one young man: Michael Brown.
Personal experience is often the best mobilizer. Those who bravely break silences and codes may speak out for themselves in the beginning. But in the end, they help all of us see across the canyons of suffering.
