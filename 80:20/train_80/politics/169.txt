Republicans weighing 2016 run facing Clinton email trap
Current and former Republican governors considering 2016 presidential runs say that they have abided by their state laws when it comes to personal emails that included government business — putting them in the same boat as former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has defended her use of a secret email account by insisting she complied with federal laws.
Mrs. Clinton’s claims have been challenged by open records experts, who say keeping her own private server and not turning over any emails until more than a year after she left office puts her in a unique category.
But GOP governors could face a difficult time trying to drive attacks on her unless they can show they’ve been more forthcoming, analysts said. And that means more than insisting they’ve complied with their own state laws.

“Many states have open records laws, so their government emails are going to come out anyway,” said Darrell M. West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. “But they can position themselves as more open than she is by putting their own emails out to the public. That would give them the moral high ground over her.”
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush set the bar for GOP governors last month when he released a selected cache of 250,000 emails from the private account that he used as governor, and, much like Mrs. Clinton, left out tens of thousands of other emails that were not deemed work-related.
Kristy Campbell, a spokesperson for Mr. Bush, said that her boss complied with Florida public records laws for more than 15 years, and said that “his emails related to state business” have long been available.
