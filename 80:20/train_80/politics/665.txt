Houston and Austin, Texas, Best Metro Areas for STEM Workers
Growth in jobs for professionals trained in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) will grow 1.7 times faster than non-STEM jobs in the period 2008 to 2018, according to a WalletHub study.
The study ranked metropolitan areas for STEM professionals using job openings per capita for STEM graduates, STEM employment growth, and our STEM High Schools Index, among other variables.
Many of the areas thought to be STEM hubs didn't make the top of the list: New York, California's Silicon Valley, Boston and Washington, District of Columbia, are all absent. Although San Jose, California, and Washington had the highest percentage of workers in STEM jobs, top cities lost out on some of the other variables, such as housing affordability and annual median wage for STEM workers after it was adjusted for cost of living.
Demand for workers in the STEM fields outstrips supply by a wide margin and yet, despite more than a decadeâ€™s worth of effort, the country is not significantly further along in meeting that need, according to the U.S. News STEM Index.
The best metro areas for STEM professionals named in the study are:
1. Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas 2. Austin-Round Rock, Texas3. Raleigh, North Carolina4. Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colorado5. Omaha-Council Bluffs, Nebraska/Iowa6. Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington7. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma8. Salt Lake City, Utah9. Columbus, Ohio10. Cincinnati, Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana
