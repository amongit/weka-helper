Kiran Bedi, Gen VK Singh were always soft on BJP, alleges AAP leader Kumar Vishwas
New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas has accused Bharatiya Janata Party's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi and Union Minister General (retired) VK Singh of being soft on the BJP even when they were with Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement.
As part of attacks and counterattacks between AAP and BJP, Kumar Vishwas said, "Kiran Bedi had not accompanied us in India Against Corruption (IAC) movement when we went to Nitin Gadkari's house."
However, Gen Singh retorted by saying that he was never a part of IAC's core team. "The people around Anna were foolish enough to allow it happen. I was never a part of internal meeting of IAC," he said.
"Whosoever has said it in AAP needs to be laughed at. It is a lie to the people of Delhi," he added.
