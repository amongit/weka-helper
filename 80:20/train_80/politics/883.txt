Obama Doubts Immigration Rollback
There's a new twist in President Barack Obama's campaign to defend his overhaul of the immigration system. Obama is now urging undocumented workers to do the necessary paperwork to avoid deportation and become legal residents because he says no future administration would dare to roll back his executive actions.

Administration officials are concerned that many people who entered the United States illegally fear coming out of the shadows and applying for legal residency under the Obama plan. Such people may be worried that the next president will roll back Obama's controversial immigration overhaul, which he announced last month, and resume the deportation of tens of thousands of undocumented workers.
In an interview with Telemundo. a television network aimed at Latino audiences, Obama said Tuesday, "You're not going to see Democrats or Republicans who suggest that we're going to treat worse the people who did the right thing compared to those folks who don't register, don't go through a criminal background check and haven't been paying their taxes."
Obama also said, "The American people believe that if you've done things the right way, then you shouldn't be punished for it....You can register, and you can be assured you won't be deported."

Obama also said in a Nashville speech Tuesday, "It's true, theoretically, a future administration could do something that I think would be very damaging." But he added: "It's not likely politically that they reverse everything we've done."
The president says he used his executive authority to change the immigration system and reduce deportations, after the Republican-controlled House declined to take up immigration reform through legislation.
