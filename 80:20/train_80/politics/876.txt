Police Killings Intensify Racial Debate
The killing of two New York City police officers this past weekend has created a backlash against critics of law enforcement, including President Barack Obama, and have made efforts to improve the nation's racial climate more difficult.
In the aftermath of the execution-style murders, some political figures are assailing Obama's recent criticism of law enforcement's treatment of African-Americans, especially the racial profiling of young black men. The critics say Obama has made it seem that he is deeply unhappy with police conduct, and some are even saying his comments about improper police practices have added to anti-police attitudes across the country.
It amounts to an intensification of an us-against-them atmosphere, with African-Americans protesting police brutality, and police officers and their supporters protesting a lack of support from some political leaders including Obama and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The two officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were sitting in their patrol car in Brooklyn when they were fatally shot Saturday afternoon by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who traveled to Brooklyn from Baltimore. Brinsley committed suicide after killing the police officers, police said.
New York police officials said Brinsley, who was African-American, had made anti-police threats on social media and expressed anger about the widely publicized cases of the killing by white police officers of unarmed African-Americans Eric Garner on Staten Island, New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Grand juries declined to indict the white officers in each case, resulting in widespread protests and some violence across the country.
New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said the officers "were shot and killed with no warning, no provocation. They were, quite simply, assassinated – targeted for their uniform and for the responsibility they embraced to keep the people of this city safe."
Mayor de Blasio said, "It is an attack on all of us; it's an attack on everything we hold dear."
President Obama, vacationing in Hawaii, issued a statement that police officers serving their communities "deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal – prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen."
But there was outrage, too. "There's blood on many hands tonight – those that incited violence on the street under the guise of protests, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day," Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, told reporters, according to the New York Times. "...That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor."
Former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly blamed de Blasio for contributing to anti-police attitudes. Kelly noted that the mayor said publicly that he told his biracial son to be careful when dealing with police. In an interview with ABC, Kelly also said, "And quite frankly, the mayor ran an antipolice campaign last year when he ran for mayor."
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told Fox News, "We've had four months of propaganda starting with the president that everybody should hate the police. The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don't lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion: 'The police are bad, the police are racist.' That is completely wrong."
