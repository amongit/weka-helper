I pity Maken; he lost focus, never took us along: Sheila Dikshit
New Delhi: The ongoing war between former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Congress' face in the just-held Delhi Assembly elections Ajay Maken came out in the open with the former accusing him of not taking other party leaders along.
Speaking to CNN-IBN on Thursday, Dikshit said, "I pity Maken. He lost focus and he never took us along."
Dikshit came down heavily on her bÃªte noire and charged him with never utilising her services for the Delhi elections. "If I was there, things would have been different," she said.
The former chief minister also tried to defend Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for the party's dismal show in the Delhi Assembly elections. "It is not right to point finger at Rahul. After all Prime Minister Narendra Mdi and BJP president Amit Shah too lost," she said.
The Congress did not get any seat in the Delhi elections even though it had contested on all the 70 seats. This is for the first time that the country's oldest political party failed to open its account in any Assembly election which it contested.
The BJP also fared badly by managing to win just three seats while Aadmi Aadmi Party (AAP) garnered 95 seats.
With Sheila outburst, the war of words between her and Maken is likely to aggravate in the days to come.
