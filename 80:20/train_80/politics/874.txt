"President Bush had another terrific day and is in great spirits," McGrath added. He said Bush "asked that his sincere wishes for a very merry Christmas be extended to one and all."
Bush spent several weeks at the Houston hospital and was discharged in January 2013 after suffering from bronchitis, a persistent cough and other health problems.
The former president has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair or motorized scooter. But he tries to remain active. He took a tandem parachute jump for his 90th birthday in June.
Bush, a Republican, served one four-year term as president starting in January 1989 but lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in November 1992. Bush had served eight years as Ronald Reagan's vice president. He is the father of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is considering a run for the White House in 2016. The Bush sons are also Republicans.
