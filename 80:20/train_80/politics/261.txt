It's Not About the Emails: Clinton's Fate Hangs on Bigger Questions - NationalJournal.com
If I knew with certainty that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was not going to be the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, I still wouldn't think this kerfuffle over her State Department emails was responsible.
This is the classic kind of inside-the-Beltway, process story that politicos and reporters get in a lather over but that resonates very little with average voters. Most Americans don't know or care what happens to the old emails of public officials. But chasing shiny objects is an occupational hazard for political journalists during odd-numbered years, because of the infrequent developments of real significance.
And, for that matter, Clinton's fate won't hinge on Benghazi either. I have yet to hear a swing voter, or anyone who has contemplated voting for a Democratic presidential candidate in years, up in arms over that one. Fox News viewers and Rush Limbaugh listeners are convinced it is the most important thing on the planet. No one else cares.

No, Hillary Clinton's challenge will be determined by how she performs, what image she projects, how she is perceived—whether she comes across as likable and relevant to the future, someone who can plausibly address the challenges facing the country. Having been largely out of the game of politics since losing the Democratic nomination to President Obama in 2008, she is akin to a professional athlete who has been sidelined by injuries for several seasons. Does she still have—to borrow a phrase from the legendary political author, the late Richard Ben Cramer—"what it takes," or Tom Wolfe's "the right stuff"? In 2007 and early 2008, Clinton was pretty good, and she got better as her contest with then-Sen. Barack Obama headed into the middle and final stretches. But does she still have it? Maybe she still has the touch, and maybe she doesn't. But no one, even her own team, knows for sure right now.
While the question of whether Clinton still has her mojo is obviously important for the general election, the 2016 contest will be more complicated than that. The overarching question is whether this election will be about "Time for a Change" or about "Changing American Demographics." Are Americans open to the concept of giving Democrats a third term in the White House, regardless of who that Democrat is? Or will the election be more about how the Republican Party and its candidates are perceived among minority and younger Americans—who will make up a larger share of the electorate in a bigger-turnout presidential year than they did in last year's midterm election? Underscoring and boldfacing that last point is whether swing voters will be in the mood to trust Republicans with all of the elected levers of federal power, a question that will be partially determined by the behavior of GOP lawmakers and presidential candidates over the next 20 months.

Too often, people see presidential elections as simply a popularity contest between two candidates, an extension of picking the homecoming king or queen, when it is really about so much more. Sure, personality and trust are important, but that's the mistake Mitt Romney's team made in 2012, trying to frame the election as simply a referendum on Obama and the economy. But it is also a question of whether at election time, voters trust and believe in an entire party enough to embrace it.
Democrats have to be wondering about two things. First, how do they feel about putting all of their eggs in one basket, betting the ranch that Hillary is going to snap back into form, be the kind of candidate they hope and need her to be, given the difficulty of holding onto the presidency for a third consecutive term. Second, would she be well-prepared for a general election by securing the nomination without breaking a sweat? It's pretty unlikely that either Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia will be able to put Clinton through her paces, so that leaves former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Will he push her hard enough that Democrats have a good idea whether she still has it? Will he push her too far to the left to reposition herself for the general election? And, if Democratic voters don't care for O'Malley, would there be time to implement a Plan B?
The 2016 election will have a lot of moving parts, and its outcome remains an enormous question, but this email business is pretty insignificant in the scheme of things.
