Delhi elections: Big jolt for BJP, Kiran Bedi's election in-charge Narendra Tandon resigns from party
New Delhi: Just five days before the Delhi elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received a jolt with its Delhi chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi's election campaign in-charge resigning from the party.
BJP State Executive member and Bedi's election campaign in-charge Narendra Tandon resigned from the party to protest, what he called, her "dictatorial attitude".
"I have resigned today. I was fed up with the dictatorial attitude of Kiran Bedi and her staff. I tried many times to convey this to the top leadership but nothing has been done," he told CNN-IBN.
Tandon, who was in the BJP for 30 years, addressed his resignation letter to BJP president Amit Shah. He said in his letter that he is hurt with the fact that Bedi who had beaten up BJP workers ruthlessly injuring many once is now ruling them.
Bedi, who had earlier refused to comment over the development, said she was not aware of Tandon's resignation.
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogender Yadav demanded a response from Shah as the letter is addressed to him. "Is this 40 years of Kiran Bedi's experience?" he said.
As a damage control exercise, the BJP is trying to downplay the controversy. Harish Khurana, an executive in Delhi unit of the BJP, claimed that Tandon has resigned twice in past as well. "It is his habit to resign and the rejoin the party," he said.
A BJP leader claimed that Tandon was not the campaign in-charge for Bedi but he was just one of the coordinators.
