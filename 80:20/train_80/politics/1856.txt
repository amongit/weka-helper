GOP Matches Truman-Era High With 246 House Seats
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans will hold at least 246 seats in the House come January, matching the post-World War II high of the Truman administration.
Republicans will expand their current 234-201 advantage by a dozen seats in the next Congress — with one race still undecided.
On Saturday, Republicans kept control of two Louisiana seats as candidates Ralph Abraham and Garret Graves won runoffs.
The House breakdown next year will be 246-188, but could grow.
There's still an automatic recount in a Democratic-held district in the Tucson, Arizona-area. Rep. Ron Barber trails Republican challenger Martha McSally by fewer than 200 voters.
If McSally wins, Republicans would have 247 seats, the largest majority since 1929-31 when the GOP controlled 270 seats in President Herbert Hoover's administration.
Republicans will run the Senate, too.
