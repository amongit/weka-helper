Rand Paul: Hillary Clinton Won't Be 'Considered For The Higher Office' Because Of Benghazi
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for failing to “defend our ambassador” during the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attack, saying this "preclude[s] her from even being considered for the higher office.”
“The biggest mistake Hillary Clinton made, and think this will be an albatross over her neck for the rest of the campaign, I don’t think she’ll be able to overcome this, is that when she was asked to provide security for Benghazi, she didn’t do it,” Paul said in an interview with Yahoo’s Katie Couric.
U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi.
Paul spoke about the ongoing effort to fight the Islamic State and revealed what he'd do if he were president.
“The only people over there that can fight and have been showing some ability to fight are the Kurds,” Paul said.
“The president has been sending weapons to Baghdad. They’re not adequately getting to Kurdistan. I would fund them directly," Paul added. "I would take some of the weaponry that we have leftover in Afghanistan and I would send that directly to the Kurds.”
Clinton and Paul are both expected to announce whether they'll launch 2016 presidential bids in the coming months.
