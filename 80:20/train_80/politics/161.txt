Rand Paul: Clintons kind of think ‘the law’s for you ordinary people’
Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, says he wishes someone had provided former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with somewhat of a technological tutorial in the wake of the recent flap over her use of private email as the country’s top diplomat.
“I wish someone had explained to her you could put two email icons on her phone,” Mr. Paul told Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith on Sunday, suggesting there was a “certain arrogance and hypocrisy” to her excuse. “The Clintons kind of think the law’s for you ordinary people.”
Mrs. Clinton said last week she used the private email out of convenience and that even though she deleted at least 31,830 emails she deemed personal, more than 30,000 were turned over to the State Department. She said the law allowed her to keep a private email account, and she “fully complied with every rule.”
Multiple outlets reported Sunday that Mrs. Clinton’s team clarified that every single email was read during the process.
Mr. Paul, a possible presidential candidate in 2016, was speaking at South by Southwest in Austin ahead of opening up an office in the city Monday. His appearance came just days after speaking at Bowie State University, a historically black college in Maryland.
“I think we’ve tried the standard candidates, and we’ve lost,” Mr. Paul told the Tribune. “I think we have to have something different if we’re going to have a large enough constituency to win in the big general elections in our country.”
