Obama drew 31.7 million viewers, a mediocre number. It turns out that viewership for his State of the Union addresses has been in steady decline. His first address to a joint session of Congress in 2009 attracted 52.4 million TV viewers. In 2010 he got 48 million for his State of the Union, and it dropped in succeeding years to 42.8 million in 2011, 37.8 million in 2012, 33.5 million in 2013, and 33.3 million in 2014, according to Nielsen, which measures TV viewership based on 13 TV networks including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC.
President Bill Clinton drew only 31.5 million viewers in 2000, at the start of his final year in office. Clinton also drew the highest number of viewers in recent years, 66.9 million for his first speech to a joint session in 1993.
But White House officials say these numbers don't tell the full story because Obama also got lots of attention from viewers of the president's web site and many sites on the Internet. That attention wasn't reflected in the Nielsen survey, White House officials say.
