Intel readying first NUC mini-desktop PC with Core i7 Broadwell processor

A few months ago, the specs for Intel's latest bunch of Next Unit of Computing (NUC) small-form-factor desktops were leaked, promising new Broadwell processors to power the systems. A quick look at Intel's NUC product page indicates that those leaks appear to be accurate, though with one key omission.
For the first time, a NUC configuration will be available with a Core i7 processor for those looking to wring the most power from the miniature desktops. Unfortunately, we know little about this particular system beyond its name (NUC5i7RYH), release date (second quarter of 2015), and the fact that it will have room for a 2.5-inch drive. The included chip is rumored to be the i7-5557U, but we'll need to wait to see if that turns out to be the case.
There are a half-dozen additional Broadwell NUC units coming, and Intel has provided more details on those versions. Four of the six join the NUC5i7RYH in offering a 2.5-inch drive slot, which makes them better suited to traditional computing tasks. Two of them include a Core i5 processor -- the NUC5i5RYH (Core i5-5250U) and the NUC5i5MYBE (i5-5300U) -- while the other pair (the NUC5i3RYH and the NUC5i3MYHE) both come with the Core i3-5010U CPU. All can handle up to 16GB of RAM, feature four USB 3.0 ports and built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and include support with M.2 solid-state storage in addition to 2.5-inch drives. Only the Core i5 versions ship with a mini-HDMI 1.4a port that can work with Intel's integrated HD Graphics 6000, however.
The remaining two new NUCs have a lower profile but obviously lack the flexibility of the additional drive. The NUC5i5RYK is powered by the i5-5250U, while the NUC5i3RYK makes use of the i3-5010U. Aside from not having the 2.5-inch drive slot, these models have similar specs to their equivalent bigger siblings (i.e., the Core i5 version includes the HDMI port and HD Graphics 6000, whereas the Core i3 does not).
Intel is positioning a couple of the new NUCs for specific use cases. The NUC5i3MYHE, for instance, is being promoted as ideal for digital kiosk or signage work, while the NUC5i5MYHE is enterprise friendly, thanks to its vPro security technology. Intel hasn't yet disclosed pricing for the Broadwell NUCs, but you can get more info on the new systems on the company's product web page.
