Google brings its Campus to Madrid
Google is bringing its Campus entrepreneur space to Madrid, the tech giant announced on Monday.
'Doing a startup is a very lonely thing': Google's Campus and what makes Tech City tick
Following the success of its London branch, which opened in 2012, Google is expanding its Campus locations. The Spanish capital joins Seoul, Sao Paulo, and Warsaw on the list of future Google-run spaces where entrepreneurs can "learn, connect, and develop those ideas that can change the world", Mary Grove, director of Google for entrepreneurs, said in a blogpost.
While exact details on the new facility scarce, Spanish newspapers El Pais and Cinco Dias both report that the Madrid Campus will open towards the end of the first half of next year. The reports say it will be housed in Matadero Madrid, an old slaughterhouse turned into an expansive arts space in the southern part of the Spanish capital.
Google's main Spanish office is located in Madrid, which is one possible reason for choosing to host the Campus in the city rather than in Barcelona. Grove's blogpost added that Google sees a thriving startup scene in Madrid. "We observed the growth of entrepreneurship in the community and we hope to help in the strengthening and development of innovation in the country and in Europe," she wrote.
If the Madrid Campus follows the lead of the original London branch, then it will offer what Google calls a combination of "collaboration, mentorship and networking" that aims to "encourage innovation". The Campus contains a coworking space and cafe, and offers free wi-fi as well as regular events hosted by Google and other experts in the startup space.
Google had not responded to ZDNet's request for comment at the time of publication.
