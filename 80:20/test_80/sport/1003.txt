Playing in the same Excel arena in which GB's boxers had such a triumphant Olympics, the British women were cheered on by an enthusiastic crowd of union flag waving supporters. Among them were Boris Johnson and Barabara Windsor, an unlikely double act barely wearing matching hairdos.
"Playing the sport I love, in front of a crowd this enthusiastic was just a dream come true," said Martine Wright, who lost both her legs in the 7/7 bombings.
"The result wasn't perfect but we'll have to regroup for the Holland game tomorrow and get ourselves back on track. Ukraine were very strong."
They were that. In a game of seven players, who sit on the floor and shuffle about the court, Ukraine seemed to have more numbers than their British opponents, much more confidently able to cover their side of the net.
Wright herself, whose story has come to symbolise Paralympic achievement, was not introduced into the action until late in the second set. Until then she had spent much of the game leading the chanting and applause from the bench.

"She's our heartbeat," said Claire Harvey, the team's No 11. "She's amazing, always encouraging us, always getting us going and lifting our chins when things go wrong."
Wright will need all her motivational powers to lift the British women, who now face Holland and then Japan in Group A. Avoiding defeat will be essential if they are to progress to the knock out stages.
