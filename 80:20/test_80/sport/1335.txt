Bath are finally maturing into a top side

Who would have thought that Bath would have been going into the match against Glasgow on Sunday with a chance of qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup quarter-final after they lost their first two games away against Glasgow and at home against Toulouse?
It is a remarkable turnaround, but then it took a remarkable performance in Toulouse last weekend, where they won 35-18, to put them in this position. I will admit that I did not see that coming. I thought they might win, but the scoreline and the quality of some of the play in such a hostile environment surprised me. It was hugely impressive.
George Ford's tackle on Yannick Nyanga, holding him up over the line, was vital. It could have been 25-25 then, and there would have been a tense last 15 minutes ahead. But you can also say that Anthony Watson was held up over the line in the first half, and it could have been 29-7 and a bonus point in the bag after just half an hour. That really would have been incredible.
This has been coming. Teams do not become successful overnight. It is like the actors and actresses on the stage. You do not get overnight successes. It is all about hard work.
Bath are a side in their third year of maturing. This is the time now when they have built up a confidence and understanding because the core of the side have been together for that period. Of the squad out in Toulouse last weekend, 13 are in their fourth year together. Both the coaches and the players have had to learn how to win big games and come out on top in big moments. Last year and the year before they did not do that against top-four sides.

There have been a couple of critical matches for them this season for differing reasons. Firstly I would pick out the 45-0 home victory against Leicester in September. That was a defining performance. It was the moment Bath said to themselves: "Right, we can do this."
But I also think that their first Champions Cup match of the season, when they lost 37-10 in Glasgow, was important for them. It was an eye opener. They do not take things for granted any more after that - I thought they did at times in that match. They missed first-up tackles and were not at the races at all really. Sometimes you need a game like that to challenge the attitude.
So the Leicester win kicked them on, while the Glasgow defeat brought them down to earth. Although they lost narrowly against Toulouse the weekend after being beaten in Glasgow, their performances since then have been much more intense collectively.
Yes, they have lost away at Northampton and Leicester, and indeed at Wasps, but beating the likes of Leicester, Saracens and Toulouse has shown that they can mix it with the top sides now, with a maturity that has taken time to come. It also took Saracens three years to break through like that. There is no doubt that, if you look at their squad now, Bath's is the strongest in the Aviva Premiership. They have such depth, especially up front.
They also have real variety to their game. They can drive, they can be competitive at the breakdown, which keeps them in games, they can kick astutely and then they have that ability to break away with some dynamic and elusive backs. But this only works because they have two sets of forwards who can put them on the front foot. In the past they did not always have one set of forwards that could do that consistently. They have always had good backs, but not necessarily the forwards.
This forward dominance forces opposition sides to kick under pressure, which can mean Bath field â€˜soft' kicks and are able to counter-attack with real menace.
Contrast that with a side being on the front foot and being able to kick to the corners and put them under huge pressure. The only time that has really happened this season was when Leicester beat Bath 17-8 at Welford Road recently.
And, boy, can Bath counter-attack and attack dangerously with the likes of Watson, Jonathan Joseph and Kyle Eastmond. They are all so good at beating opponents one-on-one. Even with very little space you can get offloads from them. They can be devastating.

Joseph was outstanding in Toulouse and it is little surprise that he has been included in the England senior squad. He may not play, but how about considering him as an international winger in the future? He has all the attributes for me.
Sometimes Bath perhaps try to play a little too much. There was a home match against Exeter recently when they overdid it for certain, but they had the quality of pack and the maturity to tighten matters up later. And they still won. They would not have done that last season.
It is about finding a balance, but because they know that they can score tries, there can be a tendency to overplay. It is no bad thing because it shows a powerful, collective intent to play. It is that intent that raises the standards in expectation about what is possible for them as a group.
This success is a combination of things coming together. You get an extra two or three per cent of things right and it is amazing what else that can lead to.
Ford has matured at fly-half. Wing Matt Banahan no longer makes the careless errors he once did and is so effective in the air. It is great to see the likes of scrum-half Chris Cook and centre Ollie Devoto doing so well, having come through the club's academy. And you have to say that coach Neal Hatley has done an incredible job with the forwards.

There are small improvements in a number of areas, but the overall effect is that the team can control big moments in big matches. That Toulouse victory last weekend showed graphically how strong they are in so many departments. You just had to look at the quality of the bench, especially the forwards, and the impact they had when they came on - the props Nick Auterac and Henry Thomas, hooker Ross Batty, lock Stuart Hooper and back-rower Carl Fearns.
I think Francois Louw, their South African flanker, is playing so much better now because he does not think he has to fight all the battles all on his own up front. When he first arrived he certainly did that. Now he has relaxed, and is not forcing matters. He is just performing his role superbly as part of an effective back row who are part of an effective pack.
Hooper is hugely influential as captain. He is a natural leader who says the right things at the right times and keeps his team honest. He is definitely an underrated part of Bath's current success.
I expect Bath to win and qualify for the quarter-finals, even if as only one of the three runners-up. They were so badly beaten in Glasgow that the victory in Toulouse last weekend will mean little now if they do not back it up.
So Sunday could indicate how ruthless they are, and how far along the journey they are to winning a big trophy. They have certainly got the talent to do that - and I have not even mentioned Sam Burgess!
