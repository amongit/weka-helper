TOTTENHAM 1 FIORENTINA 1
22:06: That's it from me. Thanks for following. Thoroughly enjoyed that match, though I know Spurs will have been kicking themselves all the way down the tunnel. My regret? Never got to saw Micah Richards, who remained on the Fiorentina subs bench all night. Maybe next Thursday!
22:03: Here's a thought. It will be very difficult to go full tilt twice in three days. So what's the priority? Reaching Europa Cup last 16 or beating Chelsea to win the Capital One Cup at Wembley? I'm a neutral but I know which I'd prefer.

Tottenham face tricky return leg after draw
22:00: Serie A takes a lot of knocks these days but Fiorentina impressed me tonight, at least after the first half hour. That was when Spurs needed to get out of sight. They had the chances, took only one, and now face a big task in the second leg.
21:58: That leaves Spurs with a lot to do in Florence next Thursday. Pochettino's famed fitness regime faces big test with his Spurs taking on West Ham (Sunday), Fiorentina (Thursday) and Chelsea (Sunday week) in three huge games. They ran out of ideas in the second half here, and that's rather worrying.
21:54: Final whistle, all over here at White Hart Lane. Spurs 1, Fiorentina 1. 21:50: Salah, always lively, shoots over. Three minutes of added time coming up.
21:47: That's better, Spurs. Kane forces a corner but Fiorentina clear. 21:45: Alonso cross whistles across face of Tottenham goal. Fiorentina looking increasingly assured here. 21:41: Ten minutes remaining here. Ten minutes (plus added time, of course) for Spurs to get something to take to Italy next Thursday.
21:38: Crowd have quietened down a bit. Do Spurs have another big finish in them?
21:35: Lamela replaces Townsend just after Fiorentina went close on a counter-attack. Good match, this, but Spurs struggling to reassert themselves after that early promise.
21:31: A warning for Spurs as Mario Gomez embarks on a weaving run, eventually shooting narrowly wide. This could go either way, now. Looks like Erik Lamela could be coming on.
21:29: Just about halfway through the second half. Kane, scorer of 23 goals this season, got a great reception from the fans. They could do with No 24 some time in the next 23 minutes or so.
21:27: It's Kane for Chadli.
21:25: Harry Kane alert. He's getting touchline instructions and is about to come on. 21:22: Mohamed Salah, the Chelsea speedster on loan to Fiorentina, starting to show his menace with a couple of dangerous upfield runs.
21:19: Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella has tweaked his formation to strengthen that vulnerable left flank, leaving Townsend with less space to attack. This is probably more the match we were expecting.
21:14: Feeling is that having conceded an away goal, Spurs will need at least two more to approach Florence with real confidence. I've been to Fiorentina's Stadio Artemio Franchi and it's not for the faint-hearted visitor.
21:10: Underway in the second half here, and Fiorentina win early corner.
20:51: A passing Spurs fan told me - before the Fiorentina equaliser - that the plan was to wrap this one up before the return leg, which is just three days before the Capital One Cup final with Chelsea. Looks a lot less likely now, but Spurs are creating plenty of chances against an uncertain defence. And there's still Harry Kane to come. Back with the second half in a few minutes.

20:49: Chadli hits the post but has to be said that Fiorentina look a rather more confident unit now. Half-time whistle blows and it's Tottenham 1, Fiorentina 1.
20:44: What a shock for Spurs. Soldado booked for fouling Joaquin on edge of penalty area and when the free-kick is only half-cleared, Basanta drives in. So now the Italians have an away goal. Let's see how Spurs react to that.
20.41: GOAL: JOSE MARIA BASANTA levels it up for Fiorentina
20:36: So, a third of the way through and all going well for Spurs. Vertonghen commanding, Townsend threatening, Eriksen controlling - and Soldado scoring.
20:34: Jan Vertonghen's shirt clearly being pulled at a Spurs corner. Referee sees nothing.
20:28: Townsend has certainly found a Fiorentina weak spot down the right wing. There's another run, finally mopped up by an uncomfortable looking defence.
20:25: Spurs have got a great tempo. Christian Eriksen shoots over and Soldado shows his rising confidence with an overhead kick, held by Tatarusanu.
20.22: Now Fiorentina are showing. Joaquin miscued a shot, then Mohamed Salah had an effort blocked. Just a little reminder to Spurs.
20:18: Andros Townsend has just cut open Fiorentina's left flank. This is good stuff from Spurs. The Italians just can't settle.
20:16: And Soldado's goal came moments after Nacer Chadli had gone so close, only denied by left foot of Fiorentina goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.
20:15: So who needs Harry Kane? Soldado still so popular at WHL and the fans just loved that finish. 20:11: GOAL: ROBERTO SOLDADO - and it's Spurs 1, Fiorentina 0. 20:06: And off they go, Fiorentina looking to attack straight from the off.
20.02: Just for the record, here's the Fiorentina subs bench: Murara Neto, Richards, Badelj, Aquilani, Alonso, Babacar, Illicic 20.00: Players in the tunnel, plenty of colour and noise from the supporters from Florence.
19.45: If Savic shows the form of his Man City days, this could be a good night for Spurs' strikers - even Roberto Soldado. But let's not underestimate La Viola - six wins and two draws in their last eight domestic matches.
19.35: Crucial spell coming up for Spurs: Europa, Premier League and Capital One Cup final. This is where we see just how good they are. 19.25: No Micah Richards but there is another former Man City defender in the Italians' back line - Stefan Savic. Fiorentina starting XI: Tatarusanu, Rodríguez, Basanta, Savic, Pizarro, Joaquín, Fernández, Valero Iglesias, Pasqual, Salah, Gomez.
19.22: Micah Richards on Fiorentina bench. Starting line-up shortly... 19.18: News coming through from Switzerland, Everton 4-1 up against Young Boys. What odds Everton are biggest British winners tonight? 19.10: Seen stronger starting line-ups. But then Mauricio Pochettino has some big matches coming up. You got a view? Let me know at ben.findon@telegraph.co.uk. 19:05: Kane on the Spurs bench. All set for the late show, then. Tottenham subs: Vorm, Dier, Rose, Dembele, Lamela, Mason, Kane
19:00: Evening everyone, feels like it should be a lively night at WHL. Here's the Tottenham starting XI: Lloris, Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Paulinho; Chadli, Eriksen, Townsend; Soldado.
Preview Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella believes they have pulled off quite a coup in coaxing Mohamed Salah from Chelsea, having lost star turn Juan Cuadrado to the west London club.
Impressive performances for club and country saw the Blues fork out £26.8 million to bring the World Cup star from the Stadio Artemio Franchi to Stamford Bridge earlier this month.
Cuadrado's deadline-day move to west London paved the way for Salah to go the other way, having endured a frustrating first year at Stamford Bridge.
The Egypt international will spend the rest of the campaign on loan at Fiorentina, for whom he netted one and provided another in Saturday's 3-1 win at Sassuolo - a display Montella believes is just the start.
"Well, I think we pulled off a bit of coup ourselves in signing Salah," the former Fulham loanee said ahead of their Europa League tie with Tottenham.
"Joking aside, it is almost a side of professional pride that someone wanted to pay so much for Cuadrado and that he developed so much as a player.
"He certainly wasn't at that level when he first arrived to play for us, so I think us, the management, the players are very proud about how far he has been able to go with our help.
"But we haven't just replaced him with one player, we have replaced him with several players.
"Salah is a very good player, he is used to playing at this level and although he has only been with us a short while, he has already shown very quickly that he is certainly up to playing very well in Italy and playing well for us."
Montella's side are flying right now, arriving in north London with a Coppa Italia semi-final to look forward to and their hopes of Champions League qualification alive.
Spurs, too, have enjoyed an impressive time of late, thanks in no small part to the exquisite form of homegrown star Harry Kane.
The 21-year-old's incredible progress makes him a shoe-in for the next England squad and has caught the attention of Fiorentina captain Manuel Pasqual ahead of the last-32 first leg tie.
"We have seen him the way that he has exploded onto the scene and no doubt that he is one of their best players," the defender said.
"We know he is a goalscorer and he need to mark him as best we can and try to stop him scoring."
