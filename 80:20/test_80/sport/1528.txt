Campbell, Selby and Stalker all medal at World Amateur boxing championships
Britons Luke Campbell and Andrew Selby reach their respective finals at the World Amateur Boxing Championships with victories in Azerbaijan .
English bantamweight Campbell edged a tight semi-final against Ireland's John Joe Nevin in Baku and praises the support he's received from his team.
Light-welterweight Tom Stalker lost in his semi-final but that means he picks up a bronze medal. While disappointed, Stalker believes Ukraine's Denys Berinchyk was the "better man".
Welsh flyweight Selby beat Uzbek Jasurbek Latipov and told the BBC's Ron Mackintosh his success is all down to his training.
