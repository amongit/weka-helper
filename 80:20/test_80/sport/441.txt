This film of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is beautifully shot and extremely thoughtful, showing the unique movement of player and pony, and why polo is both glamourous and tough.
Xaver Walser, the Swiss-South African filmmaker, has dedicated his most recent short movie to snow polo.
Called 'SECOND TO NONE', it is a fascinating behind the scenes portrait featuring gripping scenes and stirring commentary from professionals at the Snow Polo World Cup St. Moritz this year.
The film features two British players, Chris Hyde and Richard Le Poer Beresford, and the Argentine Piki Diaz Alberdi.
The trio talk about their attitude to the sport, their life as polo professionals and their unwillingness to accept defeat.
The film will be published worldwide on 24 February.
