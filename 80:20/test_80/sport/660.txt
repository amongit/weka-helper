Éric Abidal, the former France defender, who returned to playing after undergoing a liver transplant in April 2012, announced on Friday that he was retiring from football, citing 'personal reasons' for his decision.
Abidal, 35, made 67 appearances for France and last featured in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in November 2013.
He had stints at clubs including Barcelona, Lyon, Monaco, and, most recently, Olympiakos, and played in the Greek club's 2-0 Super League win at home to Panionios on Wednesday.
"Today I announce my decision to end my career here at Olympiakos," Abidal told a news conference in Athens.
"The reasons are personal," he added. "Every top-level player understands that there comes a time and my time has come."

With Barca, Abidal won the Champions League in 2009 and 2011, as well as four La Liga titles, and was runner-up with France at the 2006 World Cup.
He said there was a possibility he will join the Barça or Olympiakos coaching staff in some capacity but would first take a break to spend time with his family.
"Now what I want to do is rest and enjoy spending time with my family and then I will take some decisions as far as my future is concerned," Abidal said.
