Muhammad Ali has posted a selfie on Twitter showing him looking frail but in apparently good health after two recent spells in hospital had raised renewed fears over his wellbeing.
Ali, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1984, has a Twitter account registered under the handle @MuahmmadAli, but seldom tweets himself - marking those by him with the hashtag #AliTweet.

Last month,the boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston during their infamous 1965 rematch fight fetched nearly $1 million (£650,000) at an auction in New York.
The gloves from the bout in Lewiston, Maine on May 25, 1965 – which Ali famously won with a first-round knockout from what some saw as a “phantom punch” – were picked up by George Russo, the boxing commissioner for Maine, and later sold on to a collector in California.
