Randy Moss Reportedly Joining Fox Sports 1
By Ken Fang, Awful Announcing
In its continued hiring spree, Fox Sports is reportedly hiring former wide receiver Randy Moss as an NFL analyst. On the surface, this appears to be a very strange hiring as Moss' press conferences especially with New England and Oakland could border on the bizarre. But there was no doubt that Moss was a character when he played.
Pro Football Talk is reporting that Moss is on the verge of signing a contract with Fox Sports 1. While his role hasn't been defined, it seems that Moss will be joining the new one-hour Fox Football Daily show which would air at 6 p.m. ET. Already confirmed as castmates are Ronde Barber, Jay Glazer. Mill Hill, Jay Glazer, Curt Menefee and Brian Urlacher. This could be a very eclectic mix especially if Moss doesn't hold back and does not have a filter.
What's interesting is that he joins the same organization that employs Joe Buck and you remember the Moss mooning incident in Green Bay that led Joe to exclaim wildly.

In Moss' first show, the producers with Fox Football Daily have to find a way to work that video in.
