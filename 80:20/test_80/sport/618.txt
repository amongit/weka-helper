Masham in the Yorkshire Dales is proud of its sheep and its local beer. Both were to have contributed to festivities when the Tour de France passes through next month. So excited were the 1,200 townspeople that they half broke into French, planning “Le Grand Party” for the race. For months, people in the area had knitted bunting in the shape of 20,000 tiny cycling jerseys. But men from the council have been going up ladders, taking it down. If it got wet, officials insisted, it would grow heavy and might bend the lamp-posts. Nonsense, countered the manager of Mashamshire Community Office: “Sheep don’t fall over when they get wet.” In the face of this irrefragable truth, let us hope the careful knitwear will wave from somewhere, before the people of Masham take up the French revolutionary cry: “À la lanterne!”
