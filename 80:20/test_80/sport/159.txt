Karam's IndyCar test ends early with crash into wall
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- IndyCar rookie Sage Karam's scheduled two days of testing at Barber Motorsports Park ended with an early accident.
Karam left with a sore right hand after hitting a wall Monday morning on Turn 14. He says he'll use it as a learning experience ''and make sure it doesn't happen again.''
Ganassi Racing took his No. 8 Chevrolet home. Karam says he went into a turn too fast and the car got loose.
Karam, who turned 20 on March 5, is the youngest series driver for team owner Chip Ganassi. He was also the youngest Indy Lights champion at 18 in 2013.
Karam was ninth in his series debut last season at the Indianapolis 500.
