Shoe salesman Scott Overall turns marathon runner
Scott Overall has gone from being a man who sold training shoes to athletes to becoming a competitive athlete himself.
He tells BBC Sport's Matt Slater how he made the transition from shoe salesman to marathon runner.
Although not a full-time athlete, Overall is no stranger to the track after just missing out on qualifying for the Beijing Olympics in the 5000 metres.
