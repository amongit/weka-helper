Cyclists risk death and HIV/Aids by injecting blood, says UCI expert Olaf Schumacher

Olaf Schumacher, a German drug-testing expert who is on the panel of scientists who review cyclists' blood profiles for the UCI – the sport's ruling body – was scathing in his criticism of Fuentes' blood transfusion techniques and especially evidence provided by riders that revealed blood was transported in a ''picnic backpack''.
Schumacher said European legislation prohibited any transportation of blood bags to avoid any mix up – which could cause death – and that blood had to be stored in special refrigerated units that have back-up power and monitor temperature constantly.
Fuentes and four others are on trial for endangering the lives of their clients by using unsafe medical practices and face two years jail if convicted. The Spanish Civil Guard uncovered 200 bags of blood and plasma when it raided Fuentes' premises in 2006. The defendants have all pleaded not guilty.
Schumacher's testimony serves as a blunt warning to athletes who are continuing the banned practice of reinfusing their own blood to enhance performance.
Schumacher said a blood transfusion carried out under proper medical conditions come with risks. If unsafe, the risks multiply exponentially.

However, he said that, while the main dangers to patients occurred within the first six hours of the transfusion and usually within 24 hours, there were lingering issues that could cause death many years later such as when a bag was infected with hepatitis or HIV/Aids.
He said anybody giving blood should have had tests for diseases and have had their blood group established. "A transfusion reaction can cause organs to fail and result in death", he said.
He warned that, if the blood is not properly thawed to the correct temperature, the transfusion can cause shock to the body, and a fatal heart attack.
Lance Armstrong's US Postal team-mate Tyler Hamilton believes he was reinfused with a bag of blood that was not his own and that it led to a positive drugs test.
Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee is unlikely to fund a cycling inquiry despite a request for financial support from UCI president Pat McQuaid.
IOC executive board members are frustrated at the constant drug-related stories engulfing the sport, but believe it must sort its own problems. The stance has left the UCI increasingly isolated despite the public support for McQuaid from IOC president Jacques Rogge.
Word Anti Doping Agency executives contacted the UCI this week to inform it that they required an independent examination of all of the allegations surrounding Armstrong's 16-year doping career and that it would need a partial amnesty period for whistleblowers. Wada officials demanded that the investigation be made public.
