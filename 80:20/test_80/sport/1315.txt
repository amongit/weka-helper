It has been so wet this week that you could not open any of the exterior doors at Exeter Cityâ€™s training ground. My husband John, together with our friend Eric, purchased a new door and went down there to put it up.
We live in Sidmouth and ran a guesthouse for 22 years, but John has always done maintenance for Exeter. As we are both into our seventies we have more time now to do things for the club. When the old kit man left quickly without giving much notice, we said we would give the club a hand with washing the kits until they found a replacement. We have now been doing it for four years.
John and I wash all the kit for the players on a voluntary basis because it saves the club money. It can take us three to seven hours. The club help us out with the petrol but we do not want any more, we love what we are doing and we get a lot of pleasure from it.
The fans are very much involved because we are a trust-run club. My husband and I were two of the six people who founded the East Devon Grecians group when the club experienced financial trouble eight or nine years ago. We realised there were a lot of people supporting Exeter City from our area, and now we have in excess of 200 members. We have raised thousands of pounds for the club on our social nights.
Our manager, Paul Tisdale, is a real gentleman. He keeps us within our finances and that is rare. He treats everybody the same.

On our business nights, we decide what we are going to buy with the money we have raised. If the club need anything extra, we do all we can to make it possible for them to get it. We always put a sticker with our emblem on the equipment we provide so people know where it has come from.
John and Eric have helped to give the youth team separate facilities from the first team. It is not just us who help out. There are lots and lots of good people at this club.
Last year was our golden wedding. It was on the day we beat York 2-1, and the club gave us hospitality for the game so we had all the East Devon Grecians and lots of our family and friends down. At the end Alan Gow was man of the match and he gave us the match ball which all the team had signed. It has got its pride of place on our sideboard.
