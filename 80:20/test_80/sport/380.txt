Andy Murray on the brink of greatness as he prepares to face Novak Djokovic in Australian Open final

There are plenty of accusations levelled at Britain’s best tennis player by the Andy Murray-sceptic camp. He might be dour and stubborn at times, prickly even. Yet even his worst enemy would hesitate to call him “flash” – one of the more printable words attributed to his fiancée Kim Sears in her unguarded outburst the other night.
This is a man who lives an almost hermit-like existence of squat-thrusts and sushi; a man who treated himself to a red Ferrari six years ago and then sold it almost immediately because “When I got out of it I felt like an idiot.” This is a man who rejects starriness like oil repels water. And yet his record is gathering glitter by the season.
Victory in the Australian Open final this morning would admit Murray to a very exclusive group. If we leave out the four immortals who have achieved the career grand slam in the open era, that leaves 11 men who have ticked off three of the four landmarks.
Those players include the likes of Pete Sampras, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and indeed the Scot’s opponent on Sunday, Novak Djokovic. It is not a bad club of which to be a member.
Even if we leave the big picture to one side for a minute, this is a huge occasion in the context of the tennis year. The Australian Open tends to function as a springboard for the season.

For Murray, coming off a sequence of nine straight defeats to the old firm of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, victory here in Melbourne would put him in a commanding position to expand his legacy.
Just by reaching the final, he has already won back his position among the world’s top four and drawn a line under the post‑surgical slump of 2014.
At 27, both the finalists on Sunday are right in their prime, no matter how many pessimists might have labelled Murray washed-up in the wake of his back operation. In fact, despite all the talk of the coming generation, the evidence of the past fortnight suggests that he and Djokovic are still offering the strongest all-round combination of technical mastery, physical resilience and mental steel on the ATP tour.
It now feels as though we are back to the same place where we stood two years ago on this same Sunday morning, waiting for the same two outliers – in athletic terms – to walk out on Rod Laver Arena. Yet in between those two moments of serene and purposeful achievement, the whole Murray narrative left the straight and narrow and plunged down the twistiest of rabbit-holes.

There was the transcendent victory at Wimbledon, followed by the sense of emptiness at a lifelong goal achieved, and then the bold decision to undergo spinal surgery. After that, Murray’s agonisingly slow rehab coincided with Lendl’s exit last March, and then the surprise appointment of Amélie Mauresmo. Oddly, it was only with the departure of the two longest-serving allies in his camp – assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green – that he seems to have come back to himself.
In Sunday’s column in the Melbourne Age newspaper, Murray spoke about the long and gruelling process of fighting his way back into the grand-slam equation. “To be honest,” he said, “it’s something that Rafa might be going through a little bit just now. The guys at the top of the game are obviously some of the best players that have ever played the game. When you spend a period out of the game, to get back to that level, it takes time.
“You need to play against them, sometimes practice with them to get back to that level because it’s a bit different than playing other players.
“In the first six months of last year,” Murray added, “there was the odd match – like against Novak in Miami – where I played quite well. Or against Rafa in Rome when I was starting to gradually get there. But there were also times last year where I played them and I had no chance. Hopefully I’ll play a better match here.”
These are the rules of the game: you have to sneak up on greatness, because with the very occasional exception – Marin Cilic at the recent US Open, or Juan Martin del Potro there in 2009 – there is no such thing as a fast-track to the top. And neither can there be any compromise when it comes to playing styles. No one, with the possible exception of Michael Chang at the 1989 French Open, has ever won a grand slam by defending.

“The first time I played here I was predominantly a counter‑attacking player,” Murray said last week.
“I’ve worked a lot on trying to be more aggressive, finishing points, stepping into the court more, coming to the net a little bit when I get the chance. Every coach wants their player to play more aggressively, whether it’s me, Novak, Roger, it doesn’t matter. It was something I worked on a lot in the off-season and it’s showed here so far.”
That is the tactical shift that Mauresmo can take most credit for. And it is also the X-factor that has many of the former players picking Murray, in defiance of all the oddsmakers and statistics, to win this morning. They feel that if he stands tall and uses his extra height, weight and muscle, he can frighten Djokovic in the same way that Stan Wawrinka did on Friday night, only without the mental checkout at the end.
The best play might even be to slam the ball deep up the middle, denying Djokovic the angles that he thrives off and inviting him to open up the court first.
There are precedents here: not only the 2013 Wimbledon final, but also September’s US Open quarter-final. In New York, Murray actually outhit the world No 1 throughout the second set, scoring with a series of humungous forehands. On that occasion, he could not sustain the effort, having struggled physically throughout the tournament. But as Mauresmo pointed out yesterday, Murray’s physical conditioning is now back on song.
“I think the big part for him is that he is now capable physically of being on the court for a long time, for long best-of-five matches,” the Frenchwoman said yesterday. “He wasn’t able to do that at the US Open, for instance. Yes, we spend quite a lot of time on the court so that he knows he can last, so that he knows he can do the evolutions in his game.”
Murray, like all the great players, is certainly an evolution man. Victory on Sunday would push him on to the next stage in his development, and show that – despite all the travails of 2014 – his best years really could be ahead of him.
