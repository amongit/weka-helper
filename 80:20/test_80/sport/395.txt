Paris considering 24-hour telethon to help fund budget to launch bid for 2024 Olympic Games

Crowdfunding could be used to finance a Paris bid for the 2024 Olympics, the French Olympic Committee revealed on Tuesday.
The refusal of France’s cash-strapped government to commit public money to a fourth attempt to land the summer or Winter Games in recent years has forced the CNOSF to look at alternative sources of funding.
Its president, Denis Masseglia, confirmed a significant part of an expected £62.8 million budget could be secured through a 24-hour telethon in June prior to any bid being submitted.
“We want to use all energies, from all horizons, from artists to sportsmen,” Masseglia said. “A well-conceived TV show could be a starting point for the people’s mobilisation around the bid, even if they don’t spend more than €5 each. Such an initiative would also be a strong indicator of the public’s support to the bid.”
Speaking at the CNOSF’s headquarters, where the results of 12 workshops on a possible bid were discussed, Masseglia admitted he was unsure about the amount of money a telethon could raise and said the rest of the budget would come from private subsidies.

Paris famously lost out to London for the right to stage the 2012 Olympics, having also been beaten by Beijing in 2008.
The final straw for the government was the humiliation of Annecy in the race for the 2018 Winter Games, when it received only seven votes in an election won by Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Bernard Lapasset, the chairman of the International Rugby Board who also heads the French Committee for International Sport, said no decision on whether Paris might bid for the 2024 summer Games would be taken before January.
That is because the International Olympic Committee is expected to ratify changes to its bidding processes at its annual session in Monaco next month, something that could make it easier and cheaper for interested cities.
“After the IOC session, we’ll have a look at all our new opportunities,” Lapasset said. “Only then, we’ll start writing our final report. We’ll make sure our final document will fit with the new arrangements.”
Lapasset revealed that a Paris bid would be based on “five to nine” main venues.
Lapasset insisted that the project was enjoying state support despite the lack of enthusiasm shown by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
“But the Games would help Paris to develop, and this is what Anne Hidalgo wants for the city, too,” he said.
The next step in the organisers’ schedule will be in January, when the results of a feasibility study focusing on financial and technical issues will be submitted to state officials.
“We need to stop chewing over our loss in the race for the 2012 Games,” said IOC member Tony Estanguet, a former three-time Olympic champion in canoe slalom. “Losing is part of the game, as long as you are able to bounce back.”
By 2024, it will have been 100 years since the summer Olympics was last staged in Paris.
France decided not to bid for the 2016 or 2020 Games, which were awarded to Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, respectively.
The 2022 Winter Games will be held in either Beijing or Almaty after several other potential bidders pulled out.
