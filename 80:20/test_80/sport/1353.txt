Agassi described the Davis Cup as a "wonderful format," adding that the United States could not afford to get ahead of itself.
"When it comes to Andy, I think he's proved to everybody – certainly to me – that when he has that pressure, say, of playing at the championships at Wimbledon or in front of his home crowd, honestly it makes him a better competitor," he said.

"He doesn't get as distracted, he doesn't get as disappointed out there on the court, he doesn't let his bad moments carry into more.
"He really takes care of business in a way that I kind of wish he did all the time," he added.
But, he said, the Americans also have some very powerful players in their team, such as John Isner for example.

"Isner always throws a curve to anybody he's playing against," he said.
"But Murray is Murray and if he shows up, it's going to be hard to beat him."
