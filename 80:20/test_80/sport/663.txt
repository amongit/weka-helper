Tottenham are too predictable and we have lost our confidence, says Hugo Lloris

Hugo Lloris has admitted that Tottenham Hotspur are suffering from a severe lack of confidence because opponents have worked out how to stop them.
The French goalkeeper’s frank words come as Spurs prepare to face Everton at home on Sunday desperate to break a damaging cycle of defeats at White Hart Lane following their Thursday evening Europa League excursions.
Spurs have lost four league games at home this season – more than any other Premier League club – and all four have followed on from a European fixture.
Indeed all six of their matches following a fixture in Europe have been at home with Everton the seventh.
“We need to find the confidence again in our game,” Lloris, who is expected to retain the captaincy in the continuing absence of the injured Younes Kaboul, said.

“Everton is a big game for us. We have a lot of motivation for this. We want to make a great performance for us and the fans. We want to improve in the table and look ahead.”
However, Spurs are continuing to struggle to adjust to the team changes and tactics of new manager Mauricio Pochettino who has worked his squad hard in training and has tried to rotate as much as possible to maximise his resources and also give all the players – who are, according to sources, effectively on trial – an opportunity to impress.
Even so Spurs need to finesse their way of playing, their goalkeeper claims, as they have become too predictable and easy to defend against.
“All the teams who come here know how to play against us,” Lloris said. “They all stay behind and play on the counter-attack. We know that we have a style that is a lot of short passing and sometimes that can bring one or two opportunities for our opponents.
“We need to resolve this problem and be more firm on the pitch and try to find confidence again. You can lose games but you need to show on the pitch from the beginning to the end that you have no regrets. The last few games at home we left the pitch with a lot of regrets.”
Defeats by Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion, Newcastle United and Stoke City certainly led to those regrets, embarrassment and bitter recriminations and even suggestions that Pochettino’s position might be under threat – although the continuing signs from the Spurs hierarchy are that they are planning to move on some of the under-performing players.
That, however, is often easier said than done and Pochettino, despite his five-year deal, needs to achieve some results.
Lloris certainly does not fall into that category of under-performer. The 27-year-old has undoubtedly been Spurs’ outstanding player so far this season, and rivals Thibaut Courtois and David de Gea as the Premier League’s best goalkeeper, and it was even a surprise within the club that Kaboul rather than Lloris, was named captain by Pochettino.
Kaboul’s injury record suggested he would not be a regular while Lloris is the captain of his country and an increasingly influential figure.
Neither does Lloris stray into the suspect territory Emmanuel Adebayor entered when the controversial striker questioned whether Spurs’ supporters were sufficiently backing the team at home. “No, I am sure they will be behind us from the beginning,” Lloris says. “But after we will get what we deserve. That is football. We need to focus on our game and not think about all those other things. We just to concentrate from the dressing room.”
Spurs are languishing in mid-table and Lloris admits that ambitions to finish in the Champions League places – failure to do so would be a crushing disappointment for chairman Daniel Levy – are far from being realised at present.
“We don’t think about the top four at the moment,” Lloris said. “We have to find solutions first collectively for the team. We need to improve as a team first and then in the second part of the season will be better. We need to have a humility and to keep believing in ourselves and the club. It is our responsibility. We just need to work and try to improve and get a run of wins. That is important for our confidence.”
Of Spurs’ form, Lloris said: “It is frustrating for everyone. We are trying to find a solution and it is the same for all the players and the coach. We are all in the same situation and we will try to resolve this problem.”
It may help Spurs that they are facing Everton who also, of course, are in the Europa League with both clubs having already negotiated their way into the final 32 of the competition.
Spurs narrowly beat Partizan Belgrade at home while Everton recorded an impressive victory away over Wolfsburg. However, Roberto Martínez’s side, who are also taking the Europa League seriously, regarding it as a winnable trophy with a Champions League place as an added incentive, have won just one of their four league matches after playing in Europe this season.
Still, Lloris accepts there are no excuses – Spurs need to win. “We know we have a lot of talented players in the squad and we also know we have a lot of young players as well. We need time and we need to improve. There is a lot of expectation here and we have ambition, but we don’t have the time. We need results as quick as possible.”
