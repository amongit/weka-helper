Chris Froome says he is looking forward to getting back to winning ways next year, but has not rowed back on his threat not to race the Tour de France .
The 2013 Tour champion caused a bit of a stir last month when he revealed that his participation in next year's edition was far from guaranteed given the parcours, which features just 14km of individual time trialling.
Team Sky's leader said that he might instead target a Giro d'Italia-Vuelta a España double.
"I see myself as quite a balanced general classification rider and the Giro with its inclusion of a long TT of 60km [37 miles] and tough uphill finishes will make it a well-balanced race which suits me well," Froome said. "If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back to top shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance of aiming for the win."
Speaking to Team Sky's website on Tuesday, the 29 year-old did not seek to allay concerns that he might skip the biggest race in the world. He said that his focus was simply on returning in top physical condition after a frustrating season which saw him suffer a number of niggling injuries and illnesses as well as crash out of this year's Tour with a broken wrist and hand.

"Looking to next year, my key goal is just returning to good condition and being at the front of a race again," he said. "That's a really big motivation for me. Whether it's the Tour or any other race, it's what I love doing.
"I love racing and being able to compete at the front - to be with a team of guys who you enjoy being with, and who you work together well with. That's what gets me through the winter when I'm riding those long hours on my own."
The Kenyan-born Briton, who recently married his long-term partner Michelle Cound, said he would again be splitting his training between Europe and Africa in search of good weather.
"As usual I'll be based between Europe and Africa over the winter. I'll see how it's going and how the conditions are as that will dictate where I train."
"I think there will always be ups and down in everyone's career," he added of the season just gone. "That's sport, and especially our sport. It's full of unpredictable hurdles.
"I'm really happy to have got through the season in good stead. The Tour was a disappointment but I've still got a few victories I can be happy about this year. Also finishing the Vuelta off in such a decent way, after having all the setbacks - that for me was probably more important than anything else. It means I'll be able to go forward into next year without starting from a negative position. I can go in with a clean slate and give it my best shot."
Stephen Roche, the 1987 Tour de France champion, told Telegraph Sport last month that he could not envisage Froome skipping the Tour.
"A Giro d'Italia-Vuelta a España double is all well and good," Roche said. "It would be an incredible feat. But in terms of sponsors and visibility, it is all about the Tour. I'm sure when they all sit down, they will decide that they simply cannot miss out."
