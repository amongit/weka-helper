Robert Harting Goes 'HULK,' Flexes, Jumps Hurdles After Winning Olympic Discus Gold (PHOTOS)
-- Discus gold medalist Robert Harting of Germany put on two shows Tuesday night, one during his event and another after. His second was quite possibly the victory celebration of the London Games.
Harting ripped his shirt to shreds following his win - much like the Incredible Hulk - flexed his muscles and then took to the track to make a pass on the women's 100-meter hurdles.
"If you see me coming out of the stadium without a shirt, you know it was good," Harting said.
Entertaining, too.
With a German flag tied around his waist and flapping in the breeze, Harting sprinted down the track's outside lane. He cleared nearly every hurdle - fairly impressive for a guy his size - and then headed toward the famed Olympic cauldron. He reached into the bottom of the cauldron and tried to pull out one of the fiery metal prongs.
It didn't work, of course.
Nonetheless, the crowd at Olympic Stadium seemed impressed with his antics.
