It took just a few minutes for the scale of the challenge facing Graeme Swann to become clear. Faced with treacherous, slippery conditions on Gartheiniog, Wales Rally GB’s first stage, early on Friday morning, the former England cricketer did something he was not able to do an awful lot of towards the end of his playing days. He turned it.
Actually, Swann did more than turn it. He flipped his Ford Fiesta R2 right over on a hairpin, destroying the windscreen and denting the roof. Talk about a baptism of fire.
Driving the next two stages with what amounted to zero visibility – Swann and his co-driver Stuart Loudon elected to kick out what remained of the windshield – the 35-year-old admitted last night that he thought he was going to “kill himself”. He was only half-joking.
While his former England team-mates head off to Sri Lanka tomorrow for a one-day series, Swann, who retired midway through last winter’s
5-0 Ashes hammering in Australia, has set his sights on completing Wales Rally GB, the final round of this year’s World Rally Championship.

If that sounds simple, it is not. Swann may be a self-confessed petrolhead who grew up a stone’s throw from Silverstone; he may be the owner of an ARDS [race] licence; and he may ‘only’ be doing the national rally rather than the international version alongside the likes of two-time world champion Sebastien Ogier and former F1 star Robert Kubica. But in effect there is little difference. Swann, who had just a few weeks to prepare and met his co-driver only last week, covers the same stages as the professionals, he just does them once rather than twice. And these are monster stages.
Even the pros were finding things tricky in the forests of mid-Wales yesterday. After heavy rain over the preceding 24 hours, Northern Irishman Kris Meeke declared conditions “very, very slippery; like Rallye Monte-Carlo on gravel”.
Swann was nevertheless disappointed with himself at having flipped his car. “We were going great guns on the first run and just messed up a hairpin. We just rolled slowly on the roof but people [spectators] got us quickly back on [the road]. The conditions were hard but I wasn’t nervous at the start, I was excited.
“I was disappointed to mess up as it was a slow corner. It was a hairpin so we were barely moving. It wasn’t even like it was one of the tricky parts of the course.”

The race organisers, at least, will be delighted. Swann’s slow-speed roll – he managed to complete the day’s four stages wearing goggles to protect himself from the elements before limping back to the Service Park in Deeside, north Wales – was ideal. His progress this week is being filmed by BT Sport for a documentary and the truth of the matter is the sport could do with all the publicity it can get.
Rallying, certainly in this country, has been in the doldrums since the heady days of Colin McRae and Richard Burns. Disastrous leadership, infighting, the lack of a British star to rally behind, the hegemony of a series of Sebastiens (first Loeb and then Ogier), not to mention the lamentable television coverage in the country, which for years was confined to minor stations, have all combined to turn off British fans. There are tentative signs of recovery.
Ambitious newcomer BT Sport has picked up the baton and both it and ITV4 are showing highlights, along with Motors TV and the Welsh station S4C. Elfyn Evans, Ford’s 25-year-old Welshman, is rising through the ranks and lay seventh overnight, while the WRC’s promoters insist the global audience is growing year on year. The presence of celebrities such as Swann, they feel, can only help generate interest. It is a tactic which has been used many times before – Swann is not the only celebrity taking part this weekend, Peta Cavendish, the former glamour model who is married to Mark Cavendish is co-driving for motorsport presenter Tony Jardine – and will be used again.
Swann is certainly delighted to have been given the opportunity. Having survived yesterday, he said he was hopeful of making the finish in Llandudno on Sunday. “I thought we were going to kill ourselves,” he laughed of the two stages following the crash. “But we kicked the window out and that was fun. The fourth stage was great. We got right back on it.
“The cockpit was freezing,” he added. “It was the coldest day of my life. But it was all about finishing the stage today and getting to the service area. Now we can get the car fixed and hopefully go again in the morning.”
