I'm Kinda Sorry: Hillary's Plays on Her Emailing Ways
Let's face it, if the House of Cards character Frank Underwood was found to have used personal email to conduct his business, he'd be in big trouble. To escape his detractors, he'd run the high-risk Crazy Ivan, Little Round Top style, to stun his enemy with guts and guile.
But the plays of real politicos are decidedly less dramatic as we we saw this week with Hillary Clinton. Instead of running at the revelations of her private email service, she preferred to finesse the foment with signature testing, freezing and diverting strategies as defined in The Standard Table of Influence. To wit, these quotes...

Hillary Clinton's not as crazy as Frank Underwood (or Claire), but while in this round of political play action she was at times bold and presidential she was mostly cautious and unconvincing. A few less Red Herrings and more of her clever Pings might have kept us guessing. As it is, she lost the week and crucial momentum toward an announced candidacy.
