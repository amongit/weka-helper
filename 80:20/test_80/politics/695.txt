Wealth Inequality Has Widened Along Racial Lines
The financial crisis of 2007-2009 was the worst downturn since the Great Recession and took a toll on the pocketbooks of all American families, regardless of background. As the economy has mended, however, the distribution of wealth has deteriorated along racial and ethnic lines, a new report finds.

White households had a median net worth 13 times greater than black households in 2013, compared with eight times greater in 2010, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Federal Reserve data.
Similarly, the wealth of white households was 10 times larger than that of Hispanic households in 2013, compared with nine times in 2010.
“The current gap between blacks and whites has reached its highest point since 1989, when whites had 17 times the wealth of black households,” wrote the report’s authors, Rakesh Kochhar and Richard Fry. “The current white-to-Hispanic wealth ratio has reached a level not seen since 2001.”
The median net worth of all American families atrophied during the Great Recession, falling 39.4 percent -- from $135,700 to $82,300 -- from 2007 to 2010. But throughout the recovery, white households were the only group to increase their wealth, while the others kept seeing declines.

From 2010 to 2013, white wealth increased 2.4 percent, from $138,600 to $141,900. But non-Hispanic black households experienced a wealth decline of 33.7 percent, from $16,600 to $11,000, over that period. And among Hispanic families, wealth fell 14.3 percent, from $16,000 to $13,700.
The report notes that minority households seem not to have replenished their savings since the crisis, or perhaps they had to draw down their savings even more during the recovery. Further, white households are more likely than non-whites to own stock and to have benefitted from the rebound in equity markets.
What’s more, all American households have scaled back ownership in key wealth-building assets like homes, stocks and business equity. But the drop in ownership was more pronounced among non-white families.
For example, the homeownership rate of white households fell from 75.3 percent in 2010 to 73.9 percent in 2013. But the homeownership rate of minority households, according to Pew, declined more steeply, from 50.6 percent in 2010 to 47.4 percent in 2013.
