Hillary Clinton Needs a Reverse Sister Souljah Moment
As the 2016 presidential primary season approaches, two narratives have begun to emerge around Hillary Clinton. One is that she is almost certain to her party's nomination for president.
In the the New York Times, Nate Cohn argues that Ms. Clinton is in a much stronger position now than she was eight years ago, when she was also the early frontrunner:
No candidate, excluding incumbent presidents, has ever fared so well in the early primary polls as Mrs. Clinton. She holds about 60 percent of the vote of Democratic voters, a tally dwarfing the 40 percent she held this time in the last election cycle.
As Cohn adds, further evidence of Ms. Clinton's strength is that "not a single sitting senator, governor or vice president has declared a run."
