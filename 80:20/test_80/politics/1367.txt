We Don't Know If The Internet Can Handle This Much Girl Power In One Photo
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted a photo Thursday containing so much girl power it could "break the Internet."

Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden and panelist Rhiannon Broschat at a Center for American Progress event focusing on challenges facing women in the workplace and economic security for women and working families:
