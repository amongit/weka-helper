Here's How Much More You'll Pay for ACA Health Plans
The second open enrollment for plans on the health insurance marketplace mandated under the Affordable Care Act began in November. Americans have until Dec. 15 to sign up for plans that would begin on Jan. 1 and open enrollment ends on Feb. 15, 2015.
Those who signed up last year were satisfied overall with their coverage, according to a recent Gallup poll. Three-fourths said they were satisfied with the cost of coverage, but will they be as happy this year?
Prices for plans changed from last year. While some decreased significantly, others increased. A map from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows how premiums for the second-lowest silver plan changed this year in each county.
The average change for counties in the United States was a 2 percent increase for the second-lowest silver plans and a 4 percent increase for the lowest-cost bronze plans. See the full list of counties and plans on the KFF website.
