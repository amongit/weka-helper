Mother

Of all the words there could ever be titles and fashions of the lady I love, Mother shines way above the beauty of all tragedy.
Of all the mountains climbed, the bumpity bump of life's humps A mother of mine rings her chime with a ding and dong, a ding with her ling! She knows her worth, she knows her thing. She tells of hers, ours, all those births she's seen for whatever it is worth, she rides the ride of her life.
When all is lost and gone, and friends dwindle on, Mother is the one who basks in your love her love grown from the mourning dove and shows you what's up- way above the night and day cover her up yes, she was your first lover.
Go on, mother dear, move on, sweet and clear, you catch me deep in my sleep dreaming your touch over me draped in the night light- an incredible sight of a moon sliced bright, slivered gems of crystal delight.
I love you so ever much as stars a'shining with the humming wheels of a cosmos so real that turn inside, that say you're alive, you know the deal- as stardust, i trust, is a bite of the earth's crust- that tell me you are the dancer, alive and well, as you dance and dally, you must, you swell- I'm well!
Rolling hills of curves, and places that live inside the minds of the intelligent kind you sputter and speak, the words that leak brilliant bright beams of bombastic fantastic elastic monastic time.
Mother is mine.
