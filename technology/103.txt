Indosat facing tough task pushing BES 10 in Indonesia
Indonesian telco Indosat has been trying to find ways to persuade its corporate clients to undergo the migration to BES 10. It was reported it is first targeting about 10 of its 40-50 existing customers, with intensive talks underway with top-tier customers.
Despite the new features in BES 10 , such as increasing the number of users from 2,000 to 10,000 devices per server, customers are still not biting yet.Considering the fact that 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies and 19,000 businesses have adopted BES 10 upon its launch a few months ago, the number Indosat booked may appear to be small. Only one company so far, retailer Alfamart, has given the nod and moved forward to the platform.
The road to BlackBerry 10: The evolution of RIM's OS and BES
BlackBerry is a veteran player in this particular segment ever since they were founded. The enterprise market has long been its cash cow thanks to its focus on security. Company CIOs, IT directors and other technology executives put their faith in its security and the latest version offers BlackBerry Balance for separating work and personal data. This also helps support many BYOD adoption efforts.
However, while BYOD may be trending in the last two years especially in the U.S, from my observation the growth in Indonesia is relatively slow. It's very likely be the preferred choice but is facing strong competition from other similar software.
Indosat accounts of 50 percent of the BES marketshare in Indonesia. The enterprise business overall accounts for 20 percent of the company's total revenue.
