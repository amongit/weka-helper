CDW enhances Microsoft Office 365 migration services with SkyKick
Aside from reprogramming user habits, the biggest headache of moving to a new platform or application is the time it takes moving files and historical data. To help remove that obstacle, CDW is teaming up with SkyKick to automate and simplify conversions to Microsoft Office 365.
The joint offering centers on SkyKick's three products:
SkyKick's service is scaled for both small companies and (more recently) enterprise accounts supporting 250 to 10,000 users. "New Signature has helped hundreds of customers successfully migrate to Office 365. We are excited about SkyKickâ€™s new Enterprise Suite because its innovative technology gives us more flexibility in designing the optimal migration experience for our customers and helps us simplify the management of migration projects," said Chris Hertz, CEO of IT consulting and managed service provider New Signature, in a statement.
The enterprise solution continues the same components listed above, but the planner and project management applications are more robust and are meant to accommodate multi-domain or mixed-environment migrations.
