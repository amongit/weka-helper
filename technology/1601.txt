Southern Cal Edison IT workers laid off and unhappy. Join the club | ZDNet
I feel bad for the Southern California Edison (SCE) IT workers laid off in favor of the decision to use H-1B workers. Your fellow IT workers have felt your pain for more than ten years. It's kind of ironic that this is getting so much air time, because unfortunately for many hundreds of thousands of American workers, this is nothing new. I'm sorry for your plight, but I have to say, "Welcome to the club."It sucks having to train your replacements doesn't it? It sucks that you're threatened that you'll be separated from the company with no severance package if you don't train your replacement. It sucks knowing that the American company that you work for, and have been faithful to, can just displace you without a thought because they believe that their plan is going to have a positive impact on the bottom line. It sucks that the brilliant decision-makers believe that what they're doing is right for the company and that they're really saving money. And it sucks that it's happening to you.But, don't worry, my friends, what seems cheaper now will soon be very expensive.Cloud, automation to alter offshore outsourcing equationYeah, well, reality isn't so rosy, is it?Believe it or not, I've taken my share of criticism over the years for my stance on offshore outsourcing (offshoring) and H-1B visas for IT workers. I stand firm--firm in the opinion that it's a really bad thing to do to American workers. The reasons behind doing it are flimsy at best. Proponents state that it's less expensive and the workers are just as good. Two fallacies, I'm afraid that are like week-old pie--sure, it tastes sweet at first, but the stomach ache you get from it later isn't worth the fleeting goodness you experience in those first few bites.Offshoring rationale goes something like this:"There aren't enough US-based IT workers."Wrong. There always have been. The problem is that now, after more than ten years of progressively aggressive offshoring by American companies, fewer Americans are entering the field, hence the self-fulfilling prophecy of "not enough US-based IT workers." There actually aren't enough anywhere to fill the growing void. In the early days of offshoring, Indian companies were literally hiring people off the street using handbills to recruit workers and then providing up to six months of training to "get them up to speed." So American companies invested billions of US dollars in India and other cheap labor locations to educate and train workers to become call center employees. That was the first wave.In recent years, there has been attempts to offshore higher level architect, engineer, and more senior-level administrator positions with a low rate of success."We're moving jobs to lower cost locations."That's a clear fallacy because, it's true that you can pay lower salaries for a particular job, you have to replace your American worker with two, three, or more foreign ones. And you have to deal with high turnover rates, interesting bus schedules, time zone differences, cultural oddities, and the fact that foreign governments protect their workers from working too much.The working visa: A tricky subject for technology companiesThe enterprise must go global to remain competitive in modern-day business -- but how do visa restrictions impact growth?"My shift is over," are the famous last words of your offshore worker as he or she drops the headset and heads out the door to board the bus.The whole offshoring thing is really kind of funny, in a way, in that once a company is into it, they have to keep doing it to try to balance the work that's now displaced from the US. In other words, it's like a gambler who loses his money, but keeps gambling because now he's in too deep to stop. And neither the gambler nor the offshoring company ever wins.It's very sad, really.And still company execs wonder why they're stock is still not performing up to their lofty predictions. Some ivy league genius, in a closed-door meeting pops up with, "We need to be more aggressive in our efforts to offshore."The problem is that it never works because your customers know that you're doing it. And they, in turn, want a cheaper price. You get more business, but it's at a lower price, and you never see an increase in the bottom line. The offshoring companies never figure it out. Customers also don't like it."It's our new 24x7x365 model."Yeah, that's a good one. Ask IT worker who works in a company that offshores if they get more sleep now that the company is offshoring. The answer will be an unexpected, but ubiquitous, "No."Why? Because, as I've written, it comes down to responsibility or the lack thereof.
