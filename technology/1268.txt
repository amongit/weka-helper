Handy code-free mobile app development resources for small businesses
This post was updated Aug. 7, to add two additional resources for do-it-yourself mobile applications development: Apptive and MobileX Labs.
Many small businesses still shrug off the idea of creating a mobile app but the case for doing so continues to become stronger, not just when it comes to engaging more effectively with customers but for empowering employees.
I wrote about one example of the latter scenario last month: Ski and board shop Mount Everest in Westwood, N.J., created a mobile app to extend its LightSpeed point-of-sale (POS) solution so that the sales team is alerted when priority orders arrive. Its app helps the retailer boost credibility with certain search engines by responding more quickly. "This was essentially the only way to play. We wouldn't be able to do what we are doing without it," said Ryan McGarry, manager of e-commerce operations for the retailer.
I mentioned two similar examples involving FileMaker late last year. One is eco-friendly pet manufacturing company West Paw Design, which created an iPad app for its warehouse and inventory workers to eliminate paperwork and speed processes based on real-time information. "They can make autonomous decisions about what to produce for the customer," said Spencer William, founder of the company.
As more people become familiar with mobile apps, this trend will only continue, and it's a pretty good bet that this will accelerate dramatically over the next three years, if you consider ongoing data collected by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project.

According to one of its findings, as of mid-to-late 2013, more than 50 percent of those surveyed by Pew Research had downloaded at least one mobile app. Yes, that's only half of the respondent base, but it's double the percent of smartphone and tablet users who were doing so just a few years ago. The percentage is very generationally dependent: It was a whopping 77 percent with those younger than 30 years old, slipping to 59 percent among those from 30 to 49, and 33 percent of those 50 to 64 years old.
Still, it's not all that hard to envision a scenario just five years from now in which mobile applications represent a dominant way in which to "transact" with their customers -- whether that transaction means an actual purchase or whether a mobile application is a conduit for an appointment, an order, customer service, whatever.
Should your small business use some sort of mobile application to reach out to customers or rethink certain business processes internally? My past blogs about mobile application development resources for those interested in taking on that challenge still generate credible readership traffic, so it seemed like a reasonable juncture to update the list that I first started assembling in April 2012.
Those of you who HAVE looked at that resource in the past will know that I'm keeping my eye out ONLY for those sites, services or solutions that can be used quickly by members of your own team who aren't necessarily tech-savvy. This list DOES NOT include professional toolkit or enterprise mobile development platforms that require someone with a programming degree. Nor does it include service bureaus that provide custom design or development. The focus is on do-it-yourself (DIY) resources that allow mobile apps to be assembled quickly.
Here's my original list, plus a few additional resources, circa April 2014. As before, these resources are listed alphabetically.
