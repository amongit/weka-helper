Microsoft Office on your Android tablet? Not yet - if Intel's inside
Microsoft is doing a good job getting its flagship products on Android and iOS. Office for Android was released a few weeks ago, and in our testing is a sterling implementation. Those planning on using Office on an Android tablet need to be aware that it doesn't yet run on devices with an Intel processor.

Most Android tablets have an ARM processor and will run Office well, but more tablets are appearing with Intel inside and need to be avoided. Microsoft plans on producing a version of Office that will work on Intel-based tablets, but until that happens it's advisable to wait for the release.

When looking at Android tablets, it's not always obvious which have ARM processors and which have Intel. We checked into it and compiled a list of tablets with an Intel processor from the major OEMs. The results are listed below, sorted by brand.

There are other lesser known brands with Intel inside but these represent the major brands. Note that the Dell Venue 8 7000 that we liked so much when reviewed has Intel and thus won't currently run Microsoft Office apps.
As fast as Microsoft is producing updates, it won't be very long before Office will be available for Android tablets with Intel processors. According to ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley, Microsoft officials plan to have a version of Office for Intel-equipped tablets within a quarter. If running Office is important to you it is probably best to wait for that release before buying one of the tablets on this list.
Note that most Android tablets have ARM processors and all Samsung Galaxy tablets do so if you're shopping for a tablet and need to run Office out of the box tablets not on our list should be fine.
