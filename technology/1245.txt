Is Steve Ballmer the best Microsoft CEO candidate?
While there was nary a tear shed when Ballmer announced his impending retirement, after three months hearing about proposed CEO candidates, it begs the question, what if Ballmer actually was the best choice?
Aside from his in-depth knowledge of the Microsoft machine, with a record quarter just reported, is Steve's strategy finally paying off? He's shown tenacity, pouring money into Xbox, Bing, and hardware; grown the enterprise business, made some gutsy (and/or insane) acquisitions, and put Microsoft into the fight on many fronts.
Certainly he has his detractors--Microsoft executed poorly on mobile, has a cutthroat internal political culture (stack rank), and has been slow to get its talented technical teams to work together. Perhaps a rebuked and humbled Ballmer would modify his ways.
Microsoft announced their shortlist for candidates; others have summarized the candidates' shortcomings . Here's my take:
But what if they just kept Steve Ballmer? He's grown his executive team to include the above-mentioned talent; he has a reorganization in motion which furthered his strategy and, based on the last quarter's results, seems to be paying off. He also has the distinct experience of having run Microsoft to year after year of strong growth.
