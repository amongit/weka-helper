Integrator leverages ServiceNow to automate healthcare apps management
Fruition Partners, one of ServiceNow's elite Master Partners and cloud integration partners, has leveraged its expertise in the cloud-based service management platform to create an "App Factory" that helps healthcare organizations approach mandated updates to legacy applications more methodically.
Its new Healthcare Management Suite is targeted at healthcare payors and providers, and is specifically focused on helping them cope with ICD-10 compliance regulations for international coding standards. The suite includes a testing module to help these organizations determine which workflows and applications are ready for the conversion or whether they will have to deal with this manually.
"This application could save as much as 30 percent of the staff time that would otherwise be dedicated to serving patients and customers, and save millions of dollars within large healthcare organizations as they maneuver through the conversion to ICD-10 and other healthcare regulations," said Dominic Saroni, founder of Vosso, which teamed with Fruition Partners to create the suite.

Fruition Partners has completed more than 1,000 implementations using ServiceNow, the cloud-based platform for IT service management. It employs a team of more than 200 cloud integration experts.
