Golsie claims to be the "social network of achievement." The app offers a social platform for helping ambitious users set goals, track progress and successfully complete objectives.
The app is based around a three-stage process of Define, Track and Share, and Achieve. Define helps users create initial goals and allows for detailed descriptions, and target dates. Track and Share brings a social aspect to the app that gives users a chance to add steps, questions and notes to the goal. Achieve is the final stage wherein goal setters can mark goals as completed.
The journey to goal completion involves engagement and interaction, and rewards users with points, badges and levels as they make progress. Friendly rivalry is encouraged, allowing users to compete with friends and fellow goal setters for extra motivation.
Usefulness for business: Useful for people who want to document their objectives and share their goals with their network. In small organizations, self-set goals could be monitored by the internal HR team.
