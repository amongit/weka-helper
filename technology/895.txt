Fujitsu adds Intel Broadwell processors to new enterprise tablets, laptops

With this month's arrival of Intel's fifth-generation Core processors, a.k.a. Broadwell, system manufacturers have been furiously working to get the new CPUs into their devices. Many have already previewed those new configurations, with Fujitsu being the latest to join the Broadwell party.
The company has slowly been building up its enterprise lineup of laptops and tablets, and it's just announced a handful of new Lifebook systems along with an additional Stylistic tablet. The new offerings include a pair of Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 designs that are becoming increasingly popular. All can be equipped with Broadwell Core processors with vPro technology and will be offered with either Windows 7 Professional or Windows 8.1.
The Lifebook T935 and T725 are the new convertible tablets, with the T935 able to qualify for Ultrabook status per Intel's platform requirements. Despite having a bigger screen than the T725 (13.3 inches versus 12.5 inches), the T935 weighs a mere 3.51 pounds. Both models have durable features such as chemically strengthened glass and anti-microbial, spill-resistant keyboards -- Fujitsu, in fact, specifically calls the T935 "semi-rugged," though it's unclear what that label entails exactly.
Also described as semi-rugged is the Stylistic Q775 (pictured above), a 13.3-inch hybrid tablet with detachable screen. Businesses looking for a more traditional laptop form factor have the option of the Lifebook U745 Ultrabook. A mere 0.75 inches thick, the U745 comes with a 14-inch display and even an old-school VGA port to connect it to a projector.
Fujitsu is emphasizing security with the new systems, thanks in part to Intel's vPro technology. Fingerprint sensors, SmartCard readers, and drive encryption are all options, with the U745 and the Q775 able to be outfitted with palm sensors for further biometric protection.
No pricing information has been disclosed yet for any of the new systems, but Fujitsu is estimating a February time frame for the release of the Lifebooks and March for the Stylistic Q775.
