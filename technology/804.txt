We hear about crowdfunding projects, community-based investment into businesses and crowdsourced traffic apps, but what about dragging the community into basic, daily tasks — such as waking up? This free app acts as an alarm clock with a difference — community members sign up to wake each other up, and can set alarms in turn. In my own experience I've so far had a serenade, a military shriek to make me get up, and a quiet voice asking if I'm still asleep — from different countries around the world.

If you find yourself constantly interrupted while trying to complete tasks, ( OFFTIME ) Life Unplugged is worth a look. You can create profiles in which to disconnect for different time periods — blocking calls, texts and notifications, as well as sending out custom auto-replies. When you're ready to reconnect, you can check out an "activity log" that shows you anything you've missed.

Google Fit, joining the ranks of Samsung Health & Fitness as well as Apple's iOS 8 Health apps, seems a little unfinished at present, but has potential as a good activity tracker.

The Hunt Style & Shopping, useful in the Christmas season, is a community-based shopping application. You post a picture of something you're looking for — for example, a pair of boots you saw someone wear on the street — and other app users assist you in finding out where to buy the items, or can recommend to you similar styles.
