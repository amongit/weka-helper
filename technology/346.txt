Xiaomi creates online stir about Brazil launch
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has been creating some online buzz around a possible Brazil launch after getting the green light to sell one of its smartphones in the country.
Since last Friday (6) the company has been posting images about a supposed Brazil arrival on its official Facebook page Mi Brasil.
Xiaomi already has an office in SÃ£o Paulo and got government clearance to sell its Redmi Note 4G device by telecommunications regulator Anatel in December.
The company's Brazil-born VP Hugo Barra visited his native state of Minas Gerais last April to talk to senior government officials about his plans of "taking Xiaomi to Latin America starting from Brazil."
The Chinese company, the largest smartphone maker in its home country and the fifth largest in the world, announced its international expansion last year.
Barra told press yesterday that obstacles to delivering its smartphones to Western markets included manufacturing, packaging, regulations, and the software hurdles with a language gap, ZDNet's sister site CNET reported on Thursday as the firm prepares to launch an online store in the US.
