UK Election: Candidates Make Final Push For Votes
Britain is heading to the polls Thursday to vote in what at least one writer for the Times of London is calling "the most exciting election in a generation."
An election that was initially greeted with general disinterest has since been transformed into one that has gripped the nation, due in no small part to the jolt of energy provided by the unexpected, and game changing, emergence of Nick Clegg and the 'Cleggmania' he inspired. What once seemed a likely election victory for the Conservatives and their leader David Cameron all of a sudden became one of the most unpredictable campaigns in years.
As the Independent newspaper wrote in an editorial today entitled "This historic opportunity must not be missed":
The surge in support for the Liberal Democrats has unlocked something precious: a feeling among the public that, for the first time in a generation, a radical overhaul of our political settlement could be possible.
That feeling - combined with the enduring uncertainty over the result of the election - is a tonic for our democracy. The public sense that their vote matters. When one considers that this campaign began against a backdrop of rampant cynicism and apathy, stirred up by MPs' abuse of their expenses, this transformation looks all the more remarkable. And welcome.
The first UK election to feature live TV debates will also no doubt be remembered for Bigotgate, in which Prime Minister Gordon Brown got caught insulting a voter on an open microphone, doing incalculable damage to his party's chances.
So where do the candidates and their respective parties stand on the eve of the election? The latest YouGov poll shows the Conservatives taking 35% of the vote, with the Labour Party and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats each getting 28%. According to the latest Guardian/ICM poll, the Conservatives will fall short of a majority, with 43% of voters expecting a hung parliament. As for the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, they face one of their lowest votes "in modern times," the Guardian reports. Meanwhile the Times of London points to a Populus poll showing Conservatives with 37%, and the Lib Dems coming in third behind Labour.
Perhaps most importantly, as many as 40% of voters are apparently undecided, according to polls released Wednesday.
