These Cities Will Wake Up Tomorrow to a White Christmas
If you are dreaming of a white Christmas, depending on where you are, Santa could bring snow. Based on historical records for snow on the ground from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the map shows the probability of having at least one inch of snow on the ground.
It isn't a weather forecast. This year will actually have unusually low snow for Christmas, according to The Washington Post.
The map lets users select a city to see probabilities. Head over to the Climate Central site to see your city's probability for snow.
