AAP will rewrite history again, says Yogendra Yadav
New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav claimed on Monday that his party will rewrite history once again.
Soon after the Election Commission declared the election schedule for the Delhi Assembly elections, Yadav said it would be a straight battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP. "AAP will rewrite history once again," he said.
He admitted that the people were not happy with AAP for having quit government in 49 days. "For the first time, people were unhappy because we were leaving government. The people of Delhi have already punished AAP, they will not punish us a second time," he said, adding the principal job of the government is not to agitate but to govern.
Yadav said AAP would remind the people about seven weeks of AAP in power versus seven months of BJP's indirect rule in Delhi. He said the middle class was unhappy and disenchanted with AAP but in the last four to five weeks the tide has turned. "The middle class has changed its mind," he said.
Regarding the BJP's performance in states like Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir where it performed well, Yadav said in those states the BJP was against discredited governments. "But in Delhi, there is an alternative," he said and added that AAP is offering solutions to problems faced by the people of Delhi.
