A Perfect Storm of Population and Climate Change: Water Rationing and Riots have begun in cities, especially in developing countries like Pakistan, reports Michael Specter in the New Yorker. Climate change has disrupted increasingly the natural global distribution of water into floods and droughts, as human populations have increased exponentially. So will social disruption, unless we confront both imbalances soon, and fast.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK
Fossil Fuel Follies:
OO Huge Explosion Rips Through California Oil Refinery, Adding Fuel To Oil Worker Strike
Which Fire Do YOU Prefer? A serious accident - fire, explosion, toxic release - happens almost weekly in a US oil refinery. Electricity from solar power could power cars and heat homes instead.
"Take a gallon of gasoline. Close it up. Put it on a hot barbecue grill. Multiply that by a million. That's a refinery."
Oil Refinery Safety Expert Kim Nibarger testifying before Congress, 2013
YOU CAN ACT : Oil workers are 6 times more likely to die on the job than the average American. http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/17623/oil_strike Demand safe working conditions at oil refineries now.
Then resolve to personally divest from oil: get rooftop solar panels and an electric heater, for starters.

WHY WE SHOULD ACT NOW: RISING RISKS

Daily Climate Change: Global Map of Unusual Temperatures, Mar 2, 2015
How unusual has the weather been? No one event is "caused" by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.
Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, much of the US lower 48 are colder than normal, although the waters surrounding it are experiencing warmer than normal temperatures: the eastern Pacific warm spot has drifted south and north of the California coast, but little rain is reaching the state, sending it into further drought.
Much of the areas surrounding the North Pole, including Alaska, are experiencing much warmer than normal temperatures - not good news for our Arctic thermal shield of ice. Hotter than usual temperatures continue to dominate human habitats.

Every day is Earth Day, folks, as I was reminded by thesegentian I photographed one summer. Making the U.S. a global clean energy leader will ensure a heck of a lot more jobs, and a clean, safe future. If you'd like to join the increasing numbers of people who want to TELL Congress that they will vote for clean energy candidates you can do so here. It's our way of letting Congress know there's a strong clean energy voting bloc out there. For more detailed summaries of the above and other climate change items, audio podcasts and texts are freely available.
