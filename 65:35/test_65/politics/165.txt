Texas Senators discussing divisive immigration proposal
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - State senators are renewing discussion on a divisive immigration bill banning so-called “sanctuary cities,” an issue that has roiled the Texas Legislature in past sessions but failed to produce concrete legislation.
Republican Sen. Charles Perry has revived proposals to crack down on local police departments that take a hands-off approach on immigration laws during routine patrols.
Former Gov. Rick Perry declared the measures a priority in 2011, seeking to ban locales where police don’t ask detainees about their immigration status. But the proposals never passed.
A Senate committee is hearing Perry’s proposal Monday and may eventually approve it to the full Senate.
That comes a week after committee Democrats delayed previous discussion on the measure, arguing that the public did not have enough advance notice it was being taken up.
