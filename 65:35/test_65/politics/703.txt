Workers Are Spending More of Their Income on Employer Health Insurance
Obamacare may have contributed to a slowed rate of increase in health insurance costs, but that does not result in savings for individual workers, who in the last decade have been contributing significantly more to the cost of premiums, a new report shows.
The report, published Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund, found that the rate of growth for premium costs for employer-sponsored health insurance was higher before the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care reform law. Premiums increased 4.1 percent each year between 2010 and 2013, compared to 5.1 percent each year from 2003 to 2010.
“These recent slowdowns in health care cost growth are encouraging because they are happening even as the Affordable Care Act has given workers better health insurance coverage,” Sara Collins, Commonwealth Fund Vice President for Health Care Coverage and Access and the study’s lead author, said in a statement.
But during the last decade workers’ monthly contributions to employer-provided health insurance increased by 93 percent. Their high share of spending occurs because premiums are exceeding income growth. While income rose 11 percent, premiums rose 60 percent from 2003 to 2013.

The same was true for families over the same period. Premiums for family coverage increased 73 percent while the median family income rose 16 percent. Because of the recession, real median income for families is still said to be 8 percent lower than it was in 2007, the year before the financial downturn began.
“As employers struggle to keep health insurance premium costs manageable, they are asking their workers to pay a larger share of their insurance costs,” Dr. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement. “The recent slowdowns in overall health care costs are promising, but clearly they have not translated into relief for workers, who are spending more of their incomes on health coverage.”
The report also found that deductibles – the amount of out-of-pocket costs someone has to pay before a health insurance company kicks in to cover them – rose more slowly after Obamacare was implemented. From 2010 to 2013, the cost of deductibles rose each year by 7.5 percent, compared to more than 10 percent each year from 2003 to 2010.
In 2013, 81 percent of workers had deductibles, compared to 52 percent in 2003. Workers are therefore paying more but getting less protective benefits, the report concludes.

Among other key findings:
Most Americans have employer-sponsored insurance. While much of the focus of Obamacare has been on health insurance marketplaces – the state and federal websites that allow low- and middle-income Americans to buy health insurance plans often subsidized by the government – the participation in them is at 2 percent of the population, while employer-sponsored insurance comprises 57 percent of the population.
