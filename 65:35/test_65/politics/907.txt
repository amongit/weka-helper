Obama Addresses Ebola Critics
President Barack Obama is pushing back against critics who say his plans to fight the deadly Ebola virus have been weak and inept.
Obama indirectly criticized governors who have required the quarantine of public health workers returning to the United States from West African countries where Ebola is prevalent if these workers have been in contact with Ebola patients. Those governors include Chris Christie of New Jersey, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2016.

In remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House Tuesday, Obama called this requirement excessive and said, "We don't want to do things that aren't based on science and best practices because if we do we're just putting another barrier on somebody who's already doing important work on our behalf."
Obama also said, "America in the end is not defined by fear. That's not who we are. America is defined by possibility, and when we see a problem and we see a challenge, we fix it.....So we don't want to discourage our health care workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way."
Two nurses contracted Ebola in recent weeks after they treated a man from Liberia who had the disease and was visiting his family in Texas. The Liberian patient died but the two nurses are now recovering, U.S. officials said.
However, one factor that has Americans on edge is the reality that Ebola has killed 5,000 people in Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and victims can be very contagious.

On the political front, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, criticized the administration's response to Ebola. Bush said at Vanderbilt University, "It looked very incompetent to begin with--and that fueled fears that may be not be justified." Other Republicans who have criticized Obama's response to Ebola have included Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Questions are also being raised about how Obama's comments square with the U.S. military's imposing more stringent Ebola monitoring requirements than the ones the president and civilian health officials are advocating for civilians. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said "it's simply easier" to severely restrict the movements of thousands of military personnel coming back from their Ebola-fighting humanitarian mission in West Africa until it's clear they don't have the disease.
