Favorability of Democratic, Republican parties now both under 40 percent
Both the Democratic and Republican parties are below 40 percent favorability for the first time since Gallup started measuring the two parties’ images that way in 1992, a new survey said.
Favorability of the Republican party has dipped 5 points since just after the midterm elections last year to 37 percent, and the 39 percent favorability rating for the Democratic party is near a record low of 36 percent recorded just after the 2014 midterms.
Fifty-three percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of the Republican party, and 51 percent had an unfavorable view of the Democratic party.
“For some time, numerous Gallup trends have been showing Americans largely displeased with government’s performance and leadership,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad wrote. “Through it all, at least one political party was reviewed well, but now — perhaps because of the constant brinksmanship going on between Obama and the Republican Congress, but maybe for other reasons — both parties are floundering.”
Results for the poll were based on a survey of 1,025 adults conducted March 5-8 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
