Democracy in Decline Around the World
There has been “a growing disdain for democratic standards” around the world in the last year, according to a report released Wednesday by Freedom House. The democracy and human rights nonprofit declared only 46 percent of 195 countries surveyed free in its annual ranking of political rights and civil liberties.

Freedom House’s “Freedom in the World 2015” saw an overall decline in the freedom of governments around the world. Fifty-five countries were found to be partly free and 51 were ranked Not Free. The report ranks countries on a scale from one to seven, with one being the most free and 7 being the least. Forty-eight countries received the highest ranking for both political rights and civil liberties, while 12 received the worst ranking for both.
Many major world events from 2014 coincided with a tightening of civil liberties. Freedom House noted that antidemocratic policies fuel instability by enabling civil wars and terrorist movements, and governmental corruption causes economic insecurity.
The report found that terrorism had a palpable impact on the erosion of freedom in the Middle East as well as in Africa and South Asia. Syria and Iraq continue to be affected by the Islamic State Group, which has pushed citizens trying to escape the violence into neighboring countries. This, along with the Syrian civil war, has created a massive refugee crisis in the Middle East that is further straining neighboring governments and contributing to instability in the region.
Syria, which has been mired in civil war since 2011, received the lowest rating of any country in over a decade. That conflict has created an estimated 12 million refugees that have no visible hope of returning to their homes. Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad has refused to step down despite calls from the West, and although the war in his country has killed over 200,000 people, he recently told Foreign Affairs he doesn’t regret the actions his government has taken.
“Until recently, most authoritarian regimes claimed to respect international agreements and paid lip service to the norms of competitive elections and human rights,” said Arch Puddington, vice president for research at Freedom House. “Today they argue for the superiority of what amounts to one-party rule, and seek to throw off the constraints of fundamental diplomatic principles.”

Syria received the lowest possible rating for both political rights and civil liberties, placing it on the report’s “Worst of the Worst” list. Other countries on that list include North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Tibet.
Outside the Middle East, Nigeria and Pakistan have also experienced instability from terrorist activity. Boko Haram militants killed an estimated 2,000 people in Nigeria earlier in January, and an attack at a school in Pakistan in December killed more than 100 children. Both countries were ranked partly free.
The report ranked the Russian-annexed region of Crimea separately from both Ukraine and Russia, and found it to be not free. Freedom House also ranked Russia not free and found the country to have “intensified domestic controls on dissent, tightening its grip on the media sector and nongovernmental organizations.” Ukraine, however, was ranked partly free, in part due to the ouster of corrupt former president Viktor Yanukovych.
