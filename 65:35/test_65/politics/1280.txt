Last Call: Viet- What? GOP Pays Big Respect to Henry Kissinger
Three Things You Should Know (and a Music Video)
And Then There Was None: Another sign the end is near: White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, the last of President Barack Obama’s loyalists from the 2008 presidential campaign, is calling it quits in early March. A communications aide known for his work ethic and hard-charging demeanor, Pfeiffer was part of Obama's first team when he decided to run for president, and rose through the White House ranks to become one of his confidantes and longest serving staffer; rumors had circulated for months that he had intended to step down.

Kissing(er) the RIng: From the “How Is This A Thing” file, Politico’s Michael Crowley writes about the latest subplot in the Republican Party’s Invisible 2016 Presidential Primary: a parade of presidential wanna-bes lining up to pay respects to Henry Kissinger, who was secretary of state under Richard Nixon.

Breaking Bread, Breaking Bad: The first of what lawmakers hope will be regular bipartisan lunches happened Wednesday on Capitol Hill, a gesture towards bridging the partisan divide. Getting to know your political adversary, the theory goes, can lessen conflict, and there was actual bonhomie at the luncheon. But then, reality set in: For the second day in a row, Republicans brought a bill to the floor that tied funding for the Department of Homeland Security to a bill stripping away Obama’s executive-action protections for undocumented immigrants, and Democrats blocked it.
