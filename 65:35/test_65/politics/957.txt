Hacking Our Economy
A lot of people are giggling and guffawing over the information made public by the recent hack of the computers at Sony Pictures. The view of Hollywood “beneath the tinsel” has exposed some remarkably un-politically correct sentiments emanating from some of the rich and power inhabitants of the nation’s PC capital.
It’s all well and good to poke fun at studio executives who may now be in fear for their jobs because of private thoughts they shared about the president of the United States, bankable box office stars and other aspects of life in “Washington on the West Coast.” Except that what happened at Sony goes much farther than that.

In April 2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce released a report, "Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy: Industries in Focus," validating the value of intellectual property-intensive industries to the U.S. economy. According to that report, IP-related activities support more than 40 million jobs and generate more than $5 trillion in economic activity, which works out to slightly less than 35 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. This, from among 75 different industries out of more than 300 surveyed when taking into account the dynamic effect they have on the entire economy. “Every job in some way, produces, supplies, consumes, or relies on innovation, creativity, and commercial distinctiveness,” said Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and USPTO Director David Kappos when the report was released. “America needs to continue investing in a high quality and appropriately balanced intellectual property system that will promote innovative, open, and competitive markets while helping to ensure that the U.S. private sector remains America’s innovation engine.”

The Sony hack underscores both the truth and the danger inherent in what Kappos said. Initial reports that the infiltration of the company’s computers may have caused as much as $100 million in damages may be inflated, but we will only really know the scope of harm weeks or months from now. Even if the box office receipts of one potential blockbuster are compromised – and the Internet was full of rumors Monday that one of the items soon to appear was the shooting script for the next offering in the uber-successful James Bond franchise – losses resulting from the hack could easily exceed the initial estimate.
For some time now the industry has been trying to get Congress to focus on the problem that international intellectual property piracy presents. Two previous attempts at crafting legislation ran aground thanks to the specious notion they would have allowed patent trolls to tie up Internet commerce and put a “kill switch” in the hands of the Obama administration's Justice Department. Opposition coming from those whose business model depends on infringement of the property rights of others in the IP industry – for example helping to surface links where pirated movies can be viewed or downloaded – also may have helped blur the discussion.

Just because the House and Senate have failed to agree on an approach to the IP piracy problems before does not mean they should give up now. Nor should anyone be allowed to say the problem is not real; the hack of Sony demonstrates clearly this is a problem that will only grow bigger over time the longer it goes unaddressed. House Speaker John Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should make this issue a priority for the new Congress; it doesn’t need to be the first order of business, but it also should not be delegated to the “save for later – if we have time” box. If, as the Commerce Department report suggests, more than one-third of U.S. GDP depends on IP and IP-related activity, the threats coming to that sector of the economy from hackers and pirates, both foreign and domestic, deserve attention under regular order.
