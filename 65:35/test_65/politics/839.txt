Polls Find Deep Partisan Divide Over Obama
President Barack Obama won't ever rise very high in his job approval ratings for a simple reason: Republicans hate his policies and detest what they think he stands for, and it looks like they will never be persuaded to approve what he's doing.
The latest Gallup poll shows the huge disparity. Eighty-six percent of Democrats give Obama a favorable rating, compared with only 16 percent of Republicans (and 47 percent of independents).
A chart produced by vox.com shows in detail that partisanship has been increasing in recent years, and it has reached a new level of intensity under Obama.

During his six years in office, President Obama has averaged 81 percent support among Democrats and 14 percent among Republicans, many of whom consider him far too liberal. That's a 67 percentage point partisan gap, the largest in polling history.
President Dwight Eisenhower, who served from 1953-61, enjoyed an average of 88 percent support from fellow Republicans and 49 percent support from opposition Democrats during two terms in office, according to vox.com. John F. Kennedy, who served from 1961-63, had the support of 84 percent of fellow Democrats and 49 percent of opposition Republicans, about the same partisan gap as Eisenhower's.
During Ronald Reagan's tenure, from 1981-89, the ratings were more partisan. Reagan had the backing of 83 percent of fellow Republicans and only 31 percent of Democrats.

George W. Bush had the support of 84 percent of fellow Republicans but only 23 percent of opposition Democrats.
The latest CNN/ORC poll finds that the major parties are deeply divided even on national security issues, which have sometimes united Americans in the past. Sixty-one percent of Democrats oppose the deployment of U.S. ground troops to fight Islamic terrorists, and 61 percent of Republicans are in support. Independents are split, with 48 percent in favor and 50 percent opposed.
