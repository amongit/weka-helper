The Best of Data Mine 2014
We know what you are thinking: You'd really like to start your New Year's celebration early but desperately want some data to kick off your goodbye to 2014. Uncork the champagne (or go ahead and set tonight's kid-friendly fake Netflix countdown) because we're here to help.
It was a great year for data at Data Mine. Here are some of the posts you loved the most:
1. The U.S. Isn't Done With Ebola: In October, Texas nurse Nina Pham became the first person to contract Ebola in the United States. We predicted the incident wouldn't be the last, and it wasn't. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced two other cases in October: another Texas health worker and a New York man who had served with Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. We brought you updates about flight patterns and probability for future cases in the U.S. We also wrote about how you can help fight Ebola through humanitarian mapping, the misinformation circulating on Ebola, Americans growing anxious about Ebola (and then more anxious), the virus arriving in the U.S., how hospitals are supposed to treat Ebola patients and how it spread to the U.S.
2. World Cup Coverage: The United States men's soccer team kicked their way to victory over Ghana, tied Portugal and, after losing to Germany, proceeded to the knockout stage on goal difference. The team eventually lost to Belgium, but not before igniting an increased love for soccer in the U.S. and turning goalkeeper Tim Howard into a celebrity. We wrote about the cards, the cost of winning, what shoes the players wore, players' ages, penalty shootouts, tiebreakers, game mileage and international relations.
3. Midterm Turnout Down in 2014 and Voter Turnout Varies Widely By State: Republicans made gains in the 2014 midterm election. Despite celebrity-led vote turnout campaigns, midterm elections have a long history of drawing less voters than presidential elections. We also looked at the possibility of Internet voting.

5. What America Pays for a Haircut:
6. Coverage of the Affordable Care Act: The first round of open enrollment for one of President Obama's greatest election goals ended in April, leading to the lowest rates of uninsured Americans on record. Enrollment for 2015 started at the end of this year. We wrote about a possible loophole for pre-existing conditions, increases in health costs, signups for the second enrollment period, opinions on the website's shopping experience, the cost of ACA plans and the program's popularity.

7. 55 Colleges Under Investigation for Possible Title IX Sexual Violence Violations: The White House cracked down on sexual assault on college campuses in 2014, opening dozens of investigations for the handling of sexual violence. President Obama launched the "It's On Us" awareness campaign. Meanwhile, a student at Columbia University carried all over campus the mattress on which she said she was raped and Rolling Stone released a contested article that prompted changes to how University of Virginia handles rape allegations. We found out that 1 in 5 women are raped over the course of their lives and that student victims are less likely to report rape. We wrote about rates for domestic violence and the global effort of violence prevention.

8. Puerto Rico's Population Continues Rapid Decline: After the Census released new numbers showing a slowly growing population, we zeroed in on one area experiencing an exodus. Puerto Rico lost people more than seven times as fast as the next-closest state, West Virginia. We don't often write about Puerto Rico, but we also discussed population changes for U.S. prisons, the world (people) and the world (wildlife).

9. Obama's Minimum Wage Hike, Put Into Perspective: In early 2014, President Obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers. Several states followed by raising the minimum wage via ballot referendum in the midterm election. We also examined who America's minimum wage workers were: white, young and Southern, probably because everything is worse in the South. Later, we wrote about how often Obama used the executive order and looked at the data behind the president's speech announcing his plan to use executive actions to spare some immigrants from deportation.

10. Ranking Universities, By the Number of Billionaire Alumni: With the rising cost of colleges and uncertain employment opportunities for college graduates, you might want to consider becoming a billionaire instead of going the usual path (waiting for a surprise rich aunt). These colleges would be a good place to start.

11. Deficit Hits New Low Under Obama: In October, the federal government announced the budget deficit was the smallest since Obama took office in 2008. The primary reason: The government took in about 9 percent more money in 2014 than in 2013 and spent only about 1 percent more this year compared with last. The bulk of the revenues came from individual income and payroll taxes, corporate income taxes and receipts from the Federal Reserve. We also delved into the cost of outsourcing jobs to China and the global cost of doing business.

12. FCC Proposed Net Neutrality Change Sparks Internet Rage: The Federal Communications Commission sought comments on proposed changes to its Open Internet proceeding. After John Oliver of the HBO political satire show "Last Week Tonight" encouraged "monsters" (aka Internet commenters) to post comments on the site, the portal was flooded. The FCC received 1.1 million comments in the first period, with a peak of rage — measured by use of the f-bomb — after the show aired. We also wrote about the FCC finding inconsistent Internet speeds, FCC comments referencing Netflix and the second round of comments, which were mainly from one source.

14. Energy's Toll on Birds: After the AP reported that a California solar farm was killing 29,000 birds a year, we followed up with comparisons on the number of birds killed by different sources of energy. Turns out our love of coal kills millions and millions of little birdies. In another popular post, we wrote about the $9 million fight over another bird — the Gunnison sage grouse.

15. Think We're All Getting Married Too Late? Think Again: Despite all the talk about the rising age of marriage, if you look past the 1950s, the changes in average age for first marriages aren't all that extreme. The curve turns into a U-shape that paints the 1950s and 1960s as the exception rather than the rule. We also wrote about how marriage boosts economic inequality, the effect of marriage rates on the housing market and increasing remarriage rates.
