Republicans Look Good in 2016 Senate Race Too - US News
Sometimes political coverage at the national level is unsurprisingly predictable. Take the battle for control of the United States Senate. After months of denying and then downplaying the GOP’s chances to muster a majority in the 2014 election, a consensus now exists in the media that it is likely the Republicans will come out of it with 51 seats or more.
GOP jubilation is likely to be short-lived, however. The reporters who now concede a GOP majority in the United States Senate over the next two years are also taking pains to point out, as Politico and other publications are now doing, that with 26 Republican seats and just 10 held by Democrats up in 2016, the odds already favor the Democrats’ return to leadership in the chamber.
It’s a classic case of analysts putting the cart before a horse that hasn’t even been born yet. By and large, the class of GOP senators up for retention in 2016 has established itself as competent and effective. There are a few weak spots – a potential open seat in Illinois for example – but in the main there are few who look to be in real jeopardy.

Not so the Democrats, including several in states Mitt Romney carried in 2012 and who by rights should have been beaten in 2010, but were saved because the GOP-nominated candidates fell into a narrative that had them as too extreme to be elected. To put it another way, the Democrats are off to a fresh start in most places while the GOP just has to wind up some old business that should have been settled six years ago.
Another critical factor is the presence of a competitive presidential race at the top of the ticket. Hillary Rodham Clinton, right now the Democrat’s presumptive nominee, faces the difficult task of differentiating herself from an incumbent from her own party who is shaping up to be an unpopular chief executive who led an administration that failed to deliver on most of its promises. And the one area where Barack Obama and company have carried the day – health care reform – deprives Clinton of the ability to campaign on what had been her signature issue.
If Clinton doesn’t run, the Democrats face the prospect of nominating one from among a series of nationally unknown candidates who have been eclipsed by the attention and accolades given both Obama and Clinton over the last six years.
The Republicans meanwhile are hungry to win. The crop of potential GOP candidates is the finest in some time, with half a dozen governors and former governors and a few United States senators from different regions of the country who can all point to their records as tax cutters and government downsizers who are strong on personal freedom, reform and national defense. This only helps members of the party who are seeking election or re-election to the Senate in all but the bluest of states.
The other unknown is just how a Republican-controlled Congress will play against Obama over his last two years in office. Without Nevada Democrat Harry Reid keeping things from getting to his desk, the president is going to have to be a lot more involved in the legislative process than he has been to date.
If recent history is any guide, it’s not an arena in which he will perform well. If the GOP moves forward with an agenda for job creation and government reform, as all indications say it will, the party of Lincoln has the chance to address the concerns of the American electorate in a way it has not been able to since George W. Bush was president.

A survey released Monday of 800 likely voters nationwide conducted by Public Opinion Strategies shows the country is ready for change, and in ways that play to the Republicans’ strengths:
• By 86 percent to 6, respondents said the favored simplifying the tax code.
• By 74 percent to 23 they said they favored cutting federal spending.
• By 63 percent to 25, they support making new trade agreements with Europe and Asia.
• By 95 percent to 4, voters want to see both parties “work together to update the U.S. tax code and get America back working at its full potential.”
• By 93 percent to 4, “the next Congress needs to update the tax code so that it works better for today’s families and businesses.”
• And they agreed, 76 percent to 18 percent, that “Making the U.S. tax code simpler and more fair will spur economic growth and opportunity faster than any other action the government could take.”
As much as the Democrats and their allies in the echo chamber may believe GOP control of the U.S. Senate is a temporary matter, the fact is the indicators are pointing the other way.
