Press Upset Over White House Travel Costs
There's more trouble brewing for the White House press corps.
This time, the issue is travel costs--namely, the estimated pricetag for journalists to accompany President Barack Obama on his trip to China, Burma and Australia next month. News organizations estimate that the cost of the chartered press aircraft will be $60,000 per person, possibly the most expensive in history. And that doesn't include the costs for hotels, ground transportation, press filing centers, meals and other expenses associated with globe-trotting with the president. These could raise the total pricetag of the nine-day Asia-Pacific trip to $70,000 per person, according to the Washington Post.

The White House Correspondents' Association negotiates travel costs for the news media but there are limits to what the WHCA can do. Only two airplane charter companies bid on the Asia trip, leaving the WHCA few options. And the media pay the cost for the press charters on a pro-rated basis, so the fewer journalists who travel, the more it costs for those who do. The Post reported that only 51 journalists had signed up as of Thursday, a low number.
It's a vicious cycle. High costs cause more journalists to stay home or avoid the press charter by traveling on commercial flights, a means of travel that makes it very difficult to keep up with the president. This in turn increases the charter costs for the media travelers, which causes more journalists to avoid the charters.
Some news organizations don't think presidential travel is worth the money in many cases because access to the president and his senior staff is so limited.

This is a problem the press corps has had before. As a former president of the White House Correspondents' Association and a long-time member of the WHCA governing board, I dealt with these issues of cost and access many times.
And chances are that the travel problems will get worse. During the last two years of a president's second term, interest in the incumbent fades and attention shifts to possible successors. (Presidents are constitutionally limited to being elected to only two terms.) This declining interest will reduce media travel with Obama even more.
Similarly, tension over media access also is likely to worsen. Obama and his aides seem to be increasingly insular, which deepens resentment among reporters and photographers who feel shut out of the information flow and who object more strenuously to being denied access to the president and his senior advisers. All this tends to discourage the media from traveling with the commander in chief and intensifies friction between the White House and the press corps.
