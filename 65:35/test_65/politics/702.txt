Breast Cancer Treatment Takes Longer Than Needed
More than two-thirds of women who are treated for early stage breast cancer in the U.S. are getting radiation therapy for longer than they need to, instead of a less time-consuming version of the treatment that is considered by oncologists to be just as effective, a new study shows.
The American Society for Radiation Oncology approved a shorter course of radiation treatment in 2011 – higher doses of radiation over three weeks instead of a lower dose over five to seven weeks. The shorter term is just as effective for women who haven't had chemotherapy before and who are over age 50, research shows.
Breast cancer affects one in eight women, and is the second most deadly cancer in the U.S. behind lung cancer. Being treated with radiation five days a week is standard for women who have early stage breast cancer and have had a lumpectomy, or surgery that removes a tumor and some surrounding tissue. Radiation eliminates any cancer cells that may have been missed in the remaining breast tissue.

But the study, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that the majority of women who have lumpectomy are receiving the longer radiation course.
“It ... has similar side effects, is more convenient for patients, and allows patients to return to work or home sooner,” Dr. Justin Bekelman, an assistant professor of radiation oncology, medical ethics and health policy at Penn Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center, said in a statement.
To collect data, the researchers analyzed insurance claims data provided by Anthem, Inc., a health benefits company, and its health outcomes subsidiary, HealthCore, from 14 commercial health care plans covering 9 million women, or 7.4 percent of the female population in the U.S. The research spanned from 2008 through 2013, before and after the endorsement of shorter-term treatment by the American Society for Radiation Oncology.

More women are receiving the shorter course now than in the past: Researchers found that in 2013, 34.5 percent of women 50 years of age and older received a shorter, higher dose of radiation, up from 10.6 percent in 2008.
Among younger women and those with more advanced cancers, 21.1 percent of women received a shorter, higher dose of radiation in 2013, up from 8.1 percent in 2008.
The approach also lowers health costs – good news for health insurance companies, but not so much for providers. A shorter, higher dose of radiation has been shown to lower total health care costs by 10 percent in the first year after diagnosis. Breast cancer accounts for the largest portion of national expenditures on cancer care, and is projected to reach $158 billion in 2020, according to the study.
“[This] radiation is high-value care and high-quality breast cancer treatment that saves the health care system money," Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chairman of Penn’s Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy and a breast oncologist. "It’s a win-win."
Out-of-pocket costs for patients, however, were about the same. This may be because patients had reached their deductible and co-payment maximums. Costs are saved in other ways, the authors point out – a shorter treatment reduces time away from work and home, resulting in direct economic and quality-of-life benefits.

The current pay-for-service structure for doctors, he says, is the biggest hurtle to changing radiation approaches. "There is no financial incentive to recommend shorter duration treatment. We need to properly align payment with health care quality in order to reduce low-value cancer care," he said in a statement.
Dr. Jennifer Malin, Anthem’s oncology medical director, agrees. “This is solid, actionable information for health plans to have because it helps in collaborating with providers to develop different approaches to payment, such as flat fee schedules or bundled payments, that can improve patient experience while potentially reducing costs and maintaining the same or better health outcomes,” she said in a statement.
The findings also highlight differences in international care for patients with early stage breast cancer. In Canada in 2008, more than 70 percent of women received shorter radiation therapy.
“Everything out there says we ought to be treating more women with [a shorter treatment], and it’s only a matter of how we make that happen,” said Bekelman.
