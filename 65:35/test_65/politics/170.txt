Republicans demand voice on Iran deal
Republicans will try to find their footing anew on national security this week, looking to try to overcome last week’s ill-received letter to Iran’s leaders and instead focus on President Obama’s negotiations, and on Congress‘ role in approving whatever deal he strikes with Tehran.
Senate Republicans vehemently denied Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s claim that Congress won’t — and shouldn’t — have a role in a final agreement. A legal report last week said any lasting deal that includes the permanent lifting of sanctions will have to go through Congress.
The author of the letter, Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican, accused Mr. Obama of mishandling the letter by attacking Republicans rather than using it to drive a harder bargain with Iran. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, insisted that Congress will find a way to speak.
“We will either be voting on a bill that would require the deal to come to Congress — the president said he would veto that. Or if there is no deal, we’ll be voting on a bill that says the sanctions need to be ratcheted up,” Mr. McConnell told CNN’s “State of the Union” program as he and fellow Republicans tried to shift focus away from the letter and back toward the details of the deal Mr. Obama is negotiating.
The letter, signed by Mr. Cotton and 46 of his fellow Republicans, has proved to be a major headache for Republicans.
A week earlier, Congress heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pleaded with lawmakers to take a firmer line in their negotiations and criticized the outlines of the deal he said Mr. Obama is negotiating.
