Give the Presidential Kids a Break
The spokeswoman for a Republican congressman is under fire for making derogatory remarks about Malia and Sasha Obama, the president's teenage daughters, in the latest example of how personal and negative the political environment in Washington has become.

The flashpoint was a Facebook post from Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn. She wrote Friday that the Obama daughters behaved poorly during an event at which their father pardoned two turkeys for Thanksgiving, a tradition for presidents at this time of year.
Lauten scolded Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, for seeming bored and dismissive, and for wearing inappropriate clothing. "Try showing a little class," Lauten wrote. " ...Rise to the occasion. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at the bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events."
The Obama daughters' demeanor was criticized by others, such as writers for USA Today and Gawker, but not in the harsh terms used by Lauten. Addressing her post to Sasha and Malia, she wrote, "your mother and father don't respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so I'm guessing you're coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department."

Amid a firestorm of negative reaction during the weekend, Lauten apologized in another Facebook post. "I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager," she wrote.
"After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and rereading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were....I pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience."
White House officials declined comment.
Presidents and first ladies generally shield their children from media attention, which the Obamas have tried to do. But sometimes presidential children get in the spotlight anyway. Presidential daughters Jenna and Barbara Bush made headlines when they got a bit carried away partying while their father George W. Bush was in the White House.
Yet, the news media and political figures generally leave presidential children alone. Those who take this stance say it's best to aim criticism at the person who was elected to the White House and give the kids a break, or at least spare them from harsh ridicule.
