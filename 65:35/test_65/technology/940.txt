Dell pushes Fluid File System with updated NAS boxes
Dell has updated its storage portfolio to include support for its Fluid File System.
By bringing the Fluid File System to the Dell Compellent FS8600 NAS on Tuesday, the company has given enterprise users the ability to manage block and file storage via the same system across all three of its key storage lines — Compellent, EqualLogic and PowerVault.
"The Dell Fluid Data architecture is designed to manage the growth of our customers' data, so they can manage the growth of their business," Darren Thomas, general manager of Dell Storage, said in a statement. "We are delivering a new customer experience across a tightly integrated set of products and solutions with shared capabilities across our portfolio — driving up optimisation, driving out the cost of forced end of life, and driving forward the speed and flexibility required by IT."
Dell launched its Fluid Data Architecture in June 2011 to unify its three storage product families.
Along with the Compellent NAS, the company updated its EqualLogic and PowerVault NAS boxes to their second generation — the FS7600 family the Powervault NX3600 NAS families.
Each box comes in either 1GbE or 10GbE. The EqualLogics can scale to 509TB within a single namespace, while a paired PowerVault set can support over 1PB.
The NAS equipment will be available in the second half of 2012, Dell said.
