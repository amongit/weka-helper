Intuit integrates with Bigcommerce, Shopify in ecommerce push

Financial services and accounting software giant Intuit is looking to increase its ecommerce presence amongst small merchants.
The company announced that it has integrated QuickBooks Online with the ecommerce platforms of Shopify and Bigcommerce.
In similar fashion to previous Intuit partner integrations, the connections to Shopify and Bigcommerce focus on automating expense tracking and bookkeeping, while at the same time creating a data-driven picture of business performance.

"Delivering seamless integrations between QuickBooks Online and Shopify and Bigcommerce is all about removing a major pain point for businesses by automatically reconciling sales data," said Avi Golan, VP and GM of Intuit's developer group.
As for Shopify and Bigcommerce, both companies have built an impressive user base of small to medium-sized merchants transitioning from solely brick-and-mortar shops to the world of omnichannel. They provide access to customizable store templates, marketing tools, sales analytics and inventory management, and with just a few clicks and no expertise, merchants can successfully jump from physical to online retail.
For Intuit customers that have not yet set up online retail shops, the company said it plans to promote Shopfiy and Bigcommerce as preferred ecommerce providers. However, neither company is necessarily loyal with these types of integrations.
On Wednesday, Intuit's New Zealand-based rival Xero revealed that it too would integrate with Shopfiy, offering customers similar bookkeeping benefits such as expense tracking. Bigcommerce has a bevy of its own partner integrations, and Intuit has an arsenal of partners as well.
But opening up their platforms to each other's is an important move for each player -- and it's a recurring theme across the tech industry. When companies band together to co-market complimentary services, they expand both their use base and their product ecosystems as a whole.
