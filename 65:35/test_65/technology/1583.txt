Logitech Type+ for the iPad Air 2 hands on: Getting down to business | ZDNet
| Image 1 of 6 Pair a keyboard with the iPad Air 2 and you have a mobile work system that is a good tool for getting things done. The best cases do double duty as a good case for the expensive tablet and also a good keyboard. The Logitech Type+ is such a case, with a portfolio that is spill resistant and a keyboard that should please many iPad Air 2 owners.I have used quite a few keyboard cases for iPads predating the iPad Air 2. Over the last few years I've probably written over a million words using them. See related: ZDNet review of the Type+ for iPad AirThat heavy usage has demonstrated that for a keyboard case to work well for me it must excel in four key areas. Candidates must have a good keyboard, work well as a laptop, provide a decent tablet experience when a keyboard is not needed, and be a protective, versatile case for the tablet.Type+ caseThe Logitech Type+ is a solution that meets my requirements very well. The portfolio case is fairly thin and provides a modest amount of protection for the expensive iPad Air 2. The material on the outside of the Type+ is a durable, spill-resistant fabric that is textured so it provides a secure grip.Opening the case exposes the tablet on one side and the keyboard on the other. To use as a keyboard it's a simple process to slide the iPad forward and set it on the magnetic strip behind the keyboard. The tablet is propped up comfortably and securely.Logitech has designed the portfolio to extend slightly beyond the edges of the iPad Air 2. This permits having a keyboard that is wider than those found in most cases. This allows spreading the keys out a bit, making the keyboard closer to the size of a standard laptop.The keyboardThe Logitech Type+ keyboard is very good and facilitates rapid touch typing. The spacing between keys minimizes typos, and the key travel yields good tactile feedback.The layout of the keys mimics that of MacBooks, and that makes it possible to move between the iPad and the laptop without pause. Heavily used keys (eg Shift, Enter) are oversized as they should be.The Type+ has the standard top row of iPad control keys found on most keyboards. These include a key to invoke Siri and another to take a screen shot.Pseudo laptopWith the iPad in place above the keyboard, the Logitech Type+ provides a decent laptop experience. The magnetic strip holds the iPad in place so that it is stable, and it's possible to use the device in the lap.Unlike other cases that employ a hinge instead of a magnetic strip, it isn't possible to adjust the viewing angle of the screen depending on the environment. That costs the Type+ some points in laptop use.Using the tabletThe iPad Air 2 is not detachable from the Logitech Type+ case, so to use it without the keyboard (tablet mode), the iPad Air 2 is folded down flat over the keyboard. This works well enough, but is a bit heavy for extended tablet use. The skinnyThe Logitech Type+ is a good all around keyboard case for the iPad Air 2. I find it works as well as the previous model for the iPad Air. It is very portable while offering a decent level of protection against minor accidents.The keyboard on the Type+ is better than those found on many cases. It has long battery life and the automatic powering on and off when the iPad Air 2 is placed or removed from the typing position is a nice touch.Pros:Cons:Reviewer's rating: 9 out of 10The Logitech Type+ keyboard case is in my top three for the iPad Air 2.ZDNet reviews of top keyboard cases for the iPad Air:(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)(Image: James Kendrick/ZDNet)Pair a keyboard with the iPad Air 2 and you have a mobile work system that is a good tool for getting things done.
