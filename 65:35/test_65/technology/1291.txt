T-Mobile's Next Big Thing promo site shows off Six Appeal, likely Samsung Galaxy S6

In one week HTC and Samsung will announce new smartphones in Barcelona. T-Mobile's new Next Big Thing website has a fairly clear image of the right side of the rumored Samsung Galaxy S6, showing an edge display similar to the Galaxy Note Edge.
Speculation is that the Galaxy S6 will have dual edge displays, but that's not clear from the image shown on the T-Mobile site. There are no specifications or other details with the website designed to collect your information for notification when the device is revealed.
The back does look to be of metal construction with the typical physical home button present as well. The edge display doesn't look like it goes as deep as the Note Edge so it will be interesting to see what Samsung does with the curved display.
Other rumored specs include a 1440 x 2560 Super AMOLED display, water resistance, 3GB RAM, Samsung Exynos processor, 20 megapixel camera, and microSD card slot. We will all find out for sure on 1 March at the Samsung Unpacked event.
