The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge features a fast charge function that gives you 4 hours of usage from a 10-minute charge.The Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge also feature wireless charging, supporting WPC and PMA standards, as well as offering support for Qi-enabled chargers.One downside is that you'll have to purchase the wireless charging pad separately, which is a bit of a rub.As well has having a larger f1.9 aperture front and rear camera – which should dramatically help low-light performance – Samsung has worked on making the camera faster to access. Samsung claims that you can launch the camera in 0.7 seconds no matter whether you are using the smartphone or it is locked.Both the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge are equipped with a 5.1-inch 2,560×1,440 (QHD resolution) Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 577 ppi.With the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung has moved away from plastic to adopt a seamless, full metal and glass construction. The glass comes in the form of the highly durable Gorilla Glass 4, and the glass has been treated with a special reflective material on the inside to give it a highly jeweled finish.The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will be offered in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum options, along with a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald for the Galaxy S6 Edge.The upsides:The downsides:Samsung, which saw profits tumble by 60 percent last year, is seeing an uptick in its fortunes thanks to stronger than anticipated Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge preorders.Before they were stars: Smartwatches in pop cultureFrom the stone ages of the Flintstones to the futuristic sky cities of the Jetsons, the smartwatch has been a surprising yet underlying constant in pop culture."To be honest, pre-orders of the two Galaxy variants from our major clients are really huge," Samsung's Chief of Mobile, Shin Jong-Kyun, told reporters at MWC last week. And now analysts are pitching in with string estimates.Henry H Kim, analyst for Citibank, has revised his estimate for Galaxy S6 shipments this year. He is now expecting Samsung to ship 46 million Galaxy S6 handsets this year, up from his previous estimate of 38 million.Kim also believes that interest in the S6 will also pull in sales for lower-priced handsets. On top of that, he sees the S6 as being good for the supply chain as a whole."Success of GS6 will have positive chain impacts on the mid- to low-end market leadership and in-house component businesses (overall DRAM/NAND memory with content growth, mobile AP LSI and AMOLED display panel)."Despite this, Kin still believes that Samsung will report a 1 percent quarterly decline in operating profits for the first quarter due to "overall slow seasonality" over the Chinese New Year, but that the second quarter will be much more fruitful, with the company expected to post a 39 percent increase in quarterly profit.According to an unnamed executive, preorders for the Galaxy S6 stand at around 20 million, with the higher-priced (and presumably, higher-margin) Galaxy S6 Edge making up 5 million of that.See also:
