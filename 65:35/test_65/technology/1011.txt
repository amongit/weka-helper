Bad news for Windows Phone and BlackBerry, as the latest numbers from IDC show that Android and iOS own 96.3 percent of the global smartphone market. This has been the case for a while, as it's less than a percent higher than in 2013.
Android had the lion's share of that dominant market share, with 81.5 percent of the market. Samsung's growth in market share was flat last year, meaning smaller OEMs are becoming more important to Android.
