Perficient shores up healthcare expertise with another acquisition
Barely one month after it bought financial services consulting company ForwardThink Group , systems integrator Perficient is shoring up its healthcare industry expertise by acquiring BioPharm Sciences.
The transaction includes $11.4 million in cash and $6.2 million in Perficient common stock.
The new addition to Perficient's portfolio—it has been on an acquisition spree —is an $15 million IT consulting firm focused on life sciences that has a strong Oracle technology partnership. With this transaction, Perficient's annualized revenue is now approaching $450 million. It also adds another 50 consulting, technology, sales and support employees to the company's workforce.
"The healthcare and life sciences industries are highly regulated and complex," writes Perficient CEO Jeff Davis in a blog post about the aquisition. "Perficient believes there is substantial opportunity to better help our life sciences clients with their information technology challenges and requirements, including offering products and services designed to help accelerate the development of new drugs, devices and therapies, and improve the productivity, safety and effectiveness of clinical trials."
Perficient already offers IT systems that help with client trial management, clinical data management and safety, and phramocovigilance solutions.
Aside from solidifying Perficient's Oracle relationship, the deal brings client accounts including Bayer, CR Bard, Halozyme Therapeutics, Ikaria, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer, St. Jude Medical, Styker and Sunovion, according to the press release about the acquisition.
The CEO of BioPharm Systems, Alex Sefanov, is staying with the combined company in a Perficient leadership role.
