England do not have to play sexy rugby to win

Steve Hansen does have a point. The offside line does need to be policed more strictly. These days the line speed of some sides in defence is truly too good to be true.
But as for the accusation from the New Zealand coach, who was in Paris and Dublin last weekend to take in two of the RBS Six Nations matches, that rugby is becoming “very boring” and a lack of tries is “turning fans away”, well, there did not seem to be too many complaints from Irish fans last Sunday evening.
Winning rugby is pretty rugby. Tries are not everything.
The Aviva Premiership is probably more exciting than it has ever been, but at the next level the game changes, as claustrophobia descends in the whirl of increased ferocity and intensity (and maybe the odd offside).
The big games are tense and tight. It might be that Ireland and England meet again (after a Rugby World Cup warm-up on September 5 first) in a World Cup semi-final next autumn. I’m sure either side and their fans will take no tries for a victory. And regardless it will be a tumultuously memorable occasion.

Why Wales can stop Ireland juggernaut
Have a check of the seven finals of that competition. New Zealand scored three tries to France’s one in the first final in 1987 but they were a side way ahead of the rest at the time. Thereafter there have been two finals with no tries, one with just one try and three more with two tries in them.

Last Sunday Ireland’s utterly simple game plan, using a kicking game from which they regain so much possession that it can nearly be termed a third set piece, with a concomitant intensity and accuracy, worked quite marvellously. They scored just one try, from a kick of course, but who cared? It was still a wholly absorbing and compelling spectacle.
Hopefully, amid the disappointment of defeat, what it has done for England, despite all the wrong-end-of-the-stick-no-Danny-Cipriani brouhaha, is to confirm the line of thinking that began with victory over Australia last autumn. Namely, that there is no need to play sexy, exciting rugby.
Even next weekend against Scotland when points difference could begin to come into play should Wales beat Ireland, England must not be sucked into frivolous inaccuracies, as they were against Italy.
They must play their tight game first, as Italy showed is the most effective way of stifling Scotland, and then maybe take advantage later. But, given three awful starts so far, precision and power must come first.
Of course, some will argue that Dublin was confirmation instead that England cannot afford to play such a narrow game against the very best teams, but it was not the game plan that failed, rather the reaction of the players under pressure. They panicked, and performances shrank under duress. Discipline disappeared.

In two key areas they were overwhelmed: the kicking game and the breakdown. And Ireland’s one try emphasised their dominance in those areas.
You could argue that many of Ireland’s kicks did not actually lead to much, apart from alarm, but even before Conor Murray’s kick to nothing, with a penalty to be awarded anyway, for Robbie Henshaw’s score, England failed to deal with two other kicks in that passage of play.
It began with a Murray box kick that Jack Nowell knocked on. When Devin Toner takes the ball up there is a moment where it looks as if Billy Vunipola might effect a turnover, but he is smashed off the ball by two Irish forwards, another example of Ireland’s breakdown supremacy all afternoon.
From there, Jonathan Sexton (below) kicks across field behind Anthony Watson. The England wing retrieves the ball, running into Alex Goode in the process, but is thrown to the ground by Simon Zebo and then Ireland counter-ruck to win the ball. Yet more breakdown efficiency.
Seven times Ireland then recycled the ball swiftly, with one Chris Robshaw counter-ruck not deterring them, before Sexton makes a loop to feed Rob Kearney who is tackled high. From there Murray makes his kick.
And from there England were doomed. But where does this defeat now leave them?
Conclusions have been polarised, as you might expect. In truth England are where we thought they were before victory in Wales raised expectations, including mine, unexpectedly and probably unreasonably. They are ranked fourth in the world and this season have lost only to the three teams above them, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland. It is fair enough. What is frustrating is how maddeningly inconsistent so many individuals are. But why is this?
Is it that the English system asks its players to peak too often? Do they just play too much so that it is impossible to sustain high standards regularly? There may be something in that.
Or is it actually that the players are not quite at the level desired or perceived and that some of the performances wrung out of them have been above and beyond what might be expected given their talent and that the whole really is greater and all that?

Sadly I suspect it may be the latter. Inexperience explains some of it, but not all. I genuinely thought that some of these England players were beginning to stand up and influence matches, to start to become
world-class players, but then that belief was shattered in Dublin as too many of them were outclassed and overpowered.
Sadly the captain Robshaw led the way in that respect. It was his worst match for some time after two of his best. He is a fine international player but ratcheting up that one small notch is clearly difficult.
Players such as Dave Attwood, James Haskell and Ben Youngs were magnificent against Wales, average against Italy and then very poor against Ireland. So too Billy Twelvetrees off the bench. Dublin was also where George Ford struggled physically as much as tactically for the first time in Test rugby. Maybe given that game again Stuart Lancaster might have introduced Cipriani in his stead, but the days of an individual suddenly altering the course of a Test match for the good are mostly gone.
Rather it was the injured Owen Farrell’s best match for some time. A fit and in-form Farrell would have relished the snarling intensity and stood toe-to-toe with Sexton, a player very much in the same mould.
Matches like that do tend to avert your gaze to those proven individuals who can come back into the frame. So it was also a good match for Courtney Lawes and Mike Brown, who will now return for next weekend. And even for centre Brad Barritt, whose abrasive edge England clearly missed. He is also set to return.
England will doubtless win comfortably. So too against France in the final round. So they will probably finish second in the championship for the fourth time in four years.
It eloquently tells the story of this England side as individuals and as a collective at the moment. Good, but not quite good enough.
