World Cup Final 2014: Football came home!

The sitting room lies silent as a shellshocked Argentina fan. The sofa echoes emptier than the Maracana stadium. There are no more takers (or snatchers or grabbers) for my fleecy throws and spicy snacks.
After four weeks of family togetherness, the World Cup is over and there’s a vacuum at the heart of my home that used to be filled with Suarez and Klose and Pogba and – very briefly – that cameo appearance by England for a couple of excruciating showcase displays of Can’t-Keepie-Uppy.
Mine, I must hasten to say, is not the most sporty of households. My husband is an arts junkie rather than a football addict. His favourite side, I would hazard, is the Berlin Philharmonic.
My 12-year-old daughter is into diving. The five-year-old enjoys trampolining. I went to such an athletically challenged girls’ school that I represented it at county level in shot-putting, the 800 metres and the sprint, purely on the grounds I was marginally less rubbish than the rest.
But Brazil 2014 was a moment of genuine collective emotion as our 12-year-old daughter invariably stayed up too late and my spouse and I actually sat down in the same place at the same time. And it wasn’t even to argue.
Paul Hayward: Germany are the new rulers of world football
Germany v Argentina: as it happened
Messi award was bizarre
In truth it was blissfully, spookily attuned and chillaxed. Why? Because there were rules, off pitch as well as on, so we all knew what we were doing.
Mummy: stop making ambiguous remarks about a Gary Lineker and Thierry Henry sandwich. Daddy: just because you are being a real man atavistically watching the footie and grunting a bit doesn’t mean I am going to fetch you a beer. Daughter: stop asking about the players’ hair care regimes.
This tournament was genuine appointment television (we even had to defer our weekly subdural haematoma gratification and watch Holby City on download) and all the better for it.
Like the winning team, our moves were choreographed and fluid as a Beethoven symphony: fleecy throw, even though it’s not really chilly enough (check!), pistachios in a nibbly bowl (check!), orange squash for the bairn(check!), wine glass large enough to hold a medium sized kitten for Mummy (check!).
Daddy, just wheel in the whole crate and use it as a coffee table. Now Shhhhhhhh!
We discussed the silky (or otherwise) skills, marvelled like civilians as the professional passes, hooted and hollered at the goals and having begun by supporting teams on a game-by-game basis, last night we were as one.
United as Germany, we were just as jubilant when the little work experience fella with the heroic attempt at a beard, Mario Götze, only went and won the dang thing for them.
I think only Angela Merkel jumped higher, her Federalist fists up in the air as crazy, passionate South America was brought down by a bunch of fastidiously organised Europeans.
Being a lark rather than an owl, I rarely stay up to see the denouement of anything, but I watched the tears and the cheers and the kissing of the trophy and the fireworks.
They think it’s all over. It is now. For me more than most. Football's not coming home for another four years. Lionel Messi, I share your desolation.
