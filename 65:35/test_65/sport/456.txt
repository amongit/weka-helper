Sebastien Ogier clinched his second successive World Rally Championship title after victory in Spain yesterday.
The Frenchman’s seventh win of the season ensured he retained his title with one race to spare as he stretched his lead to 31 points over his Volkswagen Polo R team-mate Jari-Matti Latvala.
Ogier, 30, was even more delighted to claim his second crown, which he said proved that his maiden win last year was not a fluke.
“It’s a great achievement to win one title but even better to take a second,” said Ogier, who embraced his parents at the finish of the final stage, on the WRC official website. “It’s a confirmation and proves the first title was not a one-off.”
Latvala, the only man who could have stopped Ogier taking the title, finished 11.3sec behind his team-mate and was left to rue a poor opening day on the mixed-surface event.

While Latvala had a strong finish on the asphalt, Ogier timed his weekend to perfection, opening up a strong lead on day one on the gravel leg and holding off the Finn this weekend.
“It’s been a fantastic weekend, but it was tough. I pushed so hard on leg one and it was a long two days on tarmac where I had to watch Jari-Matti flying. I had to be clever and keep watching him all the time,” Ogier said after wrapping up the 23rd win of his career.
It was Volkswagen’s 11th victory of the season, which equals the record set by Citroen in 2005 and 2008.
Mikko Hirvonen claimed the last podium place in Spain, the second time the Ford Fiesta RS driver has been in the top three this season after his runner-up finish in Portugal. The Finn held off the challenge of Norway’s Mads Ostberg and Dani Sordo, who settled for fourth and fifth respectively.
