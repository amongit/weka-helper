Timekeeping need not be an issue at this venue, given that the Royal Observatory, the home of Greenwich Mean Time at Longitude 0, is located within the park.
The south-east London park is London’s oldest, dating back to 1433 and has been a World Heritage site since 1997, making it an ideal venue for visitors seeking a slice of history to go with their sporting action.
Tourists attending the equestrian events at the park can also visit the Old Royal Naval College and the National Maritime Museum, which are located within the grounds.
A temporary main arena for 23,000 spectators will be added to allow spectators to take in the equestrian and modern pentathlon events.
For the running element of the pentathlon a short-term cross country course is being designed, with a completion date set for 2012.
