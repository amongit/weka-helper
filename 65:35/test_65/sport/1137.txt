The fault with Lleyton Hewitt’s ‘Fast4’ tennis is the same as Twenty20 cricket – give me the long form of the game

Molière was never so astute as when he asserted that trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. A bottle of 1811 Chateau D’Yquem would not fetch £75,000 were it not for that vineyard’s susceptibility to “noble rot”, a fungus intensifying the final flavour. The closing crescendo of Ravel’s Boléro would have nothing like the same resonance without its atmospheric prelude. And in the same vein, the stunning climax of Roger Federer’s 2008 Wimbledon final against Rafael Nadal would be a mere footnote unless prefigured by two rain delays and almost five hours of the finest tennis ever played.
This does not stop even Federer, though, from buying into sport’s fetish for instant gratification. Hitting balls from a speedboat in Sydney Harbour, he has been proselytising the message of his friend Lleyton Hewitt’s ‘Fast4’ tennis idea, a format where the first to four wins the set, where deuce games are resolved not by an advantage system but by sudden-death points, and where players are banned from sitting down at a change of ends. The innovation rather suits Hewitt, who has always competed in a blur of fist-pumping, visor-fiddling hyperactivity, but one wonders if it is a concession too far to the attention‑deficit generation.
Rafael Nadal appeared to be relishing the quicker pace in Melbourne on Wednesday night, needing under two hours for a five-set vanquishing of Fernando Verdasco, the same adversary who had detained him long past midnight during their epic Australian Open semi-final in 2009. But whether this ‘tennis on speed’ concept represents a legitimate substitute for the original is a vexed question. The fact remains that the matches remembered the longest – say, the endless saga of Nadal versus Novak Djokovic at Rod Laver Arena (5hr 53min) or the Majorcan’s Centre Court classic with Federer in ’08 (4hr 48min) – tended to take the longest to unfold. Abbreviating such contests would be akin to distilling a seven-course tasting menu into a prescription pill.
The justification for yet another concertinaed version of sport is that time has never been so precious. The average club tennis player, or so the logic goes, is far too time-deprived to bother with extravagant indulgences as tie-breaks or first-to-six sets. It is all a fallacy, of course. We all pretend we are busier than ever, when the reality is that we are just more distracted. Shakespeare managed to compose 38 plays and 154 sonnets before his death aged 52. How much less prolific does one imagine he would have been if, say, we had replaced his quill with a MacBook Pro? What if he had foregone his immersion in the works of Ovid and Plutarch to set up five social media accounts?
It is for this reason that the United States author Jonathan Franzen claims he can only write effectively if he turns off his internet connection. The same principle applies to sport: we simply need to ring‑fence the time to pursue and enjoy it properly, not bastardise the thing itself. Forget the glib quality‑over‑quantity argument for a second. Sport, as with all the finest entertainment, is often at its best when a product of plenty, affording the freedom to luxuriate.

The best play I ever saw sounded at first like a nightmare: a verbatim reading of The Great Gatsby, lasting eight hours, with a 45-minute break for dinner. And yet from the moment the curtain came up, time seemed suspended.
The one sport that would clearly benefit from abridgement is golf. But this is less because of any intrinsic fault of the game than the ludicrous over-elaboration by players content to let their rounds last until the dawn of a third Ice Age.
Today, the spectacle is disfigured by fusspots like Kevin Na, a man so glacially slow on the course that he is described by his own PGA Tour colleague Ángel Cabrera as “painful”. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida — and the figure who could, by some horrific twist of dynastic fate, be America’s next president — waded into the debate this week after a swift 18 holes at Coral Gables that took just 2½ hours (including a 19th-hole shoot-out to settle matters).
“Golf would not be dying if more people played the way we do,” he said. “It’s not that hard, to be honest.”
Just as in tennis, golf does not automatically become more marketable through crude adulteration. I recall attending the launch in 2011 of ‘PowerPlay Golf’, designed to capture a mass audience through the flashy risk‑reward ruse of two flags on a green – one more difficult than the other, with different points to match – and the whole project has since virtually vanished without trace. It is an object lesson in the reality that no sport can be improved by warping its very essence. Perhaps Hewitt’s ‘Fast4 Tennis’ will take off as spectacularly as Twenty20 cricket, but on the initial evidence I have my doubts. It has the look of a gimmick, a peculiar amuse-bouche, rather like the snail porridge that Heston Blumenthal is preparing to serve at his new Melbourne restaurant. Give me the full meal any day.
Mayweather and Pacquiao fight is long past its prime
Forgive me if I am impervious to the romance of this ‘fight of the century’ between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, an exercise that has been longer in gestation than Finnegan’s Wake. For a start, it is uncertain whether any amount of money could be enough to tempt the mercurial Mayweather – a fighter who likes to tweet pictures from his bed of what a million dollars’ hard cash looks like – to the ring. Then comes the gnawing feeling that the bout has been scheduled too late to carry the meaning it should.
The time to have had this fight was 2009: Mayweather had just dispatched Juan Manuel Márquez and Pacquiao had poleaxed Ricky Hatton with one of the most devastating knockouts ever. A defining bout to establish the best pound-for-pound fighter was there to be made. But the opportunity passed, and five years of tiresome braggadocio on Mayweather’s part have served to strip the matchup of its proper context.
Pacquiao’s ambitions are now focused more on the political scene in his native Philippines, while Mayweather’s last win conveyed little of the strut of old. It is a grim reflection of the greed dictating boxing negotiations that the only power struggle we have so far witnessed between these two has been in terms of who possesses the most dogged lawyers. The loser is the fan who will be seduced into paying an obscene price to see a fight of diminished validity.
Ronaldo’s golden gaffe
When Cristiano Ronaldo was asked during Fifa’s Ballon d’Or ceremony to name the most emotional achievement of his stellar 2014, he had an embarrassment of riches from which to choose.
How about that giddy Lisbon night when he grasped Real Madrid’s hallowed Décima, or the four goals against Elche that brought a 25th hat-trick in the all-white strip? Instead, he said with a remarkably straight face that what had moved him most was the team’s triumph at the Club World Cup in Morocco, which just so happened to be the one tournament he had won with Fifa branding.
Sometimes, one senses that even football’s most precious moments are commercially rigged.
