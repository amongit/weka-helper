Manchester City return 912 unsold tickets as fans make a stand over Arsenal's £62 away prices

It means, despite possessing one of the most devoted away followings in the country, City will not have their full allocation of 3,000 fans in the away end this weekend.
The move follows a pricing of £62 for away supporters, equivalent to the cheapest adult home seats elsewhere in the stadium. City have returned the unsold tickets, nearly a third of their allocation, to the London club.
Arsenal ticket pricing has come under mounting criticism, with their own supporters vocal in their opposition to the rising costs of watching Arsène Wenger’s side.
A match against the Premier League champions is ranked as a Category A fixture by Arsenal, meaning it costs more to watch. Arsenal now intend to sell the returned tickets to their own supporters.
A recent study showed that Arsenal charge more than any other club in England for a season ticket – £1,955. City are not alone in being asked to fork out such a price.

Liverpool supporters will be asked to pay the same amount if they wish to attend their club’s fixture with Arsenal on Jan 30.
That is £18 more than the cheapest away ticket available for the Manchester United v Liverpool game at Old Trafford this weekend.
Meanwhile, City have recalled defender Dedryck Boyata from his loan at Eredivisie side FC Twente.
