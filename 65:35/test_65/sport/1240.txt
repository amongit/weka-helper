Liverpool vs Manchester United: as it happened
By Alan Tyers
4:00PM GMT 22 Mar 2015
FULL TIME: A crazy and highly enjoyable match. The bald facts are that Man United are now firmly installed in fourth place, five points ahead of Liverpool in fifth. Juan Mata scored twice, one a neatly placed finished and the other one a bit of a screamer. Steven Gerrard came on at half time and was off again by the 46th minute, but Liverpool fought back gamely with ten men. The football was of mixed quality, but for pantomime drama, you cannot ask for more. Thanks for reading, enjoy the rest of the weekend.
15.59 Why not have a look at our live blog of Hull vs Chelsea, which is just starting.
15.57 Here's the story about Gerrard's incredible red card.
15.56 Here are the Five Things We Learned (sorry, Steven Gerrard)
15.55 Well, what a match. All very silly, but highly enjoyable. Here is the match report from Anfield
15.50 Laughed at this tweet.
<noframe>Twitter: Vithushan - "People won't remember Steven Gerrard for one mistake in this game."Says the French bloke who cheated against Ireland.</noframe>
15.45 Here is Chris Bascombe with his match report from Anfield:
Steven Gerrard was determined to leave a final mark on English football prior to his summer farewell, but this was not what he had in mind.
Manchester United left Anfield with a 2-1 victory to put them in command of the pursuit for fourth, but assistance came from an unlikely source as Gerrard was sent off less than a minute seconds after his half-time introduction.
The Liverpool captain could have no complaints. He stamped on Ander Herrera’s ankle - a mental aberration after he’d been given the call to salvage the game.
Maybe he was too pumped up awaiting his opportunity having sat on the bench for 45 minutes, but already a goal down to Juan Mata, the Spanish midfielder inflicted further punishment on the 10 men with a superb volley before Daniel Sturridge briefly offered hope.
<noframe>Twitter: Michael Cox - English football has a bizarre obsession with player "fronting up", so weirdly Gerrard will probably come out of this quite well now</noframe>
15.43 And here is Steven Gerrard himself speaking to Sky Sports.
I have let my team-mates down and I have let the manager down. I have reacted wrongly. I take full responsibility. I don't know what caused it, maybe I reacted to the tackle coming in but I don't really want to say any more. I apologise to everyone in the dressing room and all the supporters. I take full responsibility for the defeat today.
<noframe>Twitter: Football365 - Did we miss the bit where he apologised to the man he, you know, stamped on?</noframe>
15.40 Excellent quotes from Jamie Carragher on his friend Steven Gerrard:
You think of some of Steven Gerrard's best games for Liverpool - the Cup Final against West Ham, Istanbul, that is not him playing with his head, being calculated and calm. That is him playing with his heart. He is an emotional player. I think the frustration of not playing, of being on the bench, and that tackle flying in, has made him do it. It was a moment of madness.
15.35 Here is Luke Edwards with the Five things he learned from Liverpool 1 Man United 2. Some of them don't make very happy reading for Liverpool fans.
This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season against their biggest rivals and their celebrated captain, icon and heartbeat could only make the bench. He is fit and available, but surplus to Brendan Rodgers’ requirements. The frustration felt might help explain why he stamped on Ander Herrera just 30 seconds after coming on at the start of the second half.
There is a good reason Liverpool delayed offering him a new contract and it is why Gerrard will leave for a new adventure with LA Galaxy at the end of the season. Gerrard is a true Liverpool great, a legend even if he returns to manage the club and makes a mess out of it one day, but he is not the player he was and he knows it. It’s the right time for Gerrard to say goodbye because, as a business, Liverpool simply could not justify satisfying the high wage demands of a squad player, no matter how important he has been
15.30 Juan Mata agrees "this was my best game for Man United."
"End to end, mistakes, and a sending off makes things even more chaotic," says Phil Jones.
FULL TIME: LIVERPOOL 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 2 What a thoroughly enjoyable match that was. So much top-level foolishness. Where to begin? We'll pick over the incidents for a few minutes here on the blog so stay with us if you can.
First, and obviously making a strong case to have been the most idiotic person on display, is Steven Gerrard, who managed to stay on the pitch for less than a minute.
90+ mins: In the dying minutes, Rojo comes on. Martin Skrtel, for it is he, suddenly finds himself haring forward in the inside left position. He's never going to get on the ball but, as De Gea comes out, he leaves his foot in and deals De Gea a really nasty blow on the shin. De Gea is livid. They have to be seperated but, fortunately (by which I mean, unfortunately) they both calm down before any real fisticuffs can start, and soon after that, the referee blows the final whistle!
90+ mins: Mignolet saves the penalty! Hit to his right, quite well struck but not far enough away from the keeper, and the cliched "nice height" as well. Mignolet pushes it away
90+ mins: Danny Blind gets down the left, Can has been caught out, he tries to recover but Blind is free and clear... Can brings him down. A clear penalty. Rooney steps up.
90 mins: We'll have four minutes added on. Who will be the next person to so something absolutely stupid?
89 mins: A deep cross into the United area sees De Gea make a commanding grab under pressure from Mario Balotelli.
87 mins: Rooney, who has been busy rather than actually any good, gives away a foul on Coutinho. Liverpool cannot make much of the freekick. Fellaini tidies up.
<noframe>Twitter: Michael Cox - Some of the pure stupidity in this game has been incredibly enjoyable</noframe>
84 mins: Liverpool go up the other end and cause problems with a corner.
83 mins: This game's got the lot. Under the very mildest pressure from Di Maria - more a polite enquiry than actaul pressure - Can and Mignolet somehow contrive to get in a huge muddle. They nearly hand it to the Argentine.
81 mins: Ander Herrera's day is done, Falcao comes on in his place. Rooney over to the bench to receive some instructions.
80 mins: Liverpool, improbably still bang in this match, have a corner that is well gathered by David D.
79 mins: Just vastly enjoyable, this. You can keep your Messis and your Ronaldos. For good old fashioned pantomime ding dong, you have to go Premier League.
78 mins: Amazing. Balotelli gets into it with Smalling down the wing and IS HELD BACK BY FANS OF LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB! Couple of blokes in the front row grab him and, I think probably just as well, because he looked like he was on tilt for a second there.

73 mins: Liverpool are not going gently into that god night. Excellent forward play by Raheem and Daniel, and they've got the United defence on the rope here. Smalling has just fouled Sturridge. Mignolet, by the way, is okay. Mario's freekick hits the wall.
72 mins: Rooney goes up for a high ball with keeper Mignolet, and ends up dealing him a nasty kick on the ankle with his trailing leg. I don't think Rooney meant any harm by it, but you could make the case either way.
GOAL! Coutinho surges forward, he slides it to Daniel Sturridge, who sprints into the area down the inside right channel and hits it hard at goal. The ball takes a deflection off a United defender and beats De Gea at the near post. LIVERPOOL 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 2 (Sturridge 69)
65 mins: Mignolet putting himself under needless pressure as he tries to get cute under pressure from Rooney. Stupidity from Balotelli, as he rakes his studs down the shin of Jones from behind with absolutely no prospect of getting the ball. Just needless spite and idiocy, rightly booked.
64 mins: Moreno, who was sucked out of position for the second goal, is taken off. "He's had a poor day, he's getting the handshakes but it won't make him feel any better," says Gary Neville. Mario B comes on to replace him. Well, that's what this game needs - the calming influence of Balotelli. Andrew writes:
On, pass, pass, pass, tackle, stamp, off. Took me longer to type that than Stevie G to act it out.
61 mins: To their credit, Liverpool are not lying down. Here's Sturridge powering down the middle and giving the United defenders a hard time.
60 mins: Di Maria running riot down the left, crosses hard and low and that was just a foot or two away from Rooney. Mata was also well placed.
GOAL! What a goal! This is sooopoib. Mata with a darting run towards goal, he slips it to Angel Di Maria who playes a lovely little chip forward (grubber kick?!) and then here's the boy Mata with a magnificent acrobatic volley to make it two! Brilliant play. LIVERPOOL 0 MANCHESTER UNITED 2 (Mata 58)
56 mins: Now the ball is launched long and Di Maria runs onto it... steadies himself underneath it and catches it inside the touchline! He's gone Six Nations barmy! He tries to take a throw in but the referee has to gently remind him that you're not allowed to catch the ball with your hands.
<noframe>Twitter: Paul Hayward - That Phil Jones hack at Henderson happened right in front of us in the press box. And it was a red, not given.</noframe>
55 mins: Jones has gone in hard on Henderson, a gallumphing thunderbison of a tackle that earns him a yellow and could well, in this day and age, have been worse.
53 mins: Ashley Young, who seemed to be limping, has been withdrawn in favour of Angel Di Maria.
52 mins: Well, if nothing else, the Gerrard red has stung Coutinho into actio. Strong run and shot from him. Over.
50 mins: All that experience, and Gerrard has made an absolutely crazy decision.
48 mins: Turning, reluctantly, back to the football, Mata has made a strong run down the right but Liverpool clear their lines.
<noframe>Twitter: Dapper Laughs - Gerrard lasted nearly as long as me TV show.</noframe>
46 mins: Looks like Gerrard is going to play at the back of midfield. His first action is to go into a tackle with Juan Mata that gets everyone pumped up. Now he's made another tackle, this one on Ander Herrera AND THEN STAMPED ON HIM! STRAIGHT RED CARD! They're saying 25 seconds on the telly. Gerrard's cross. He's bloody fuming. Incredible scenes. How brilliant. Herrera is also getting a yellow, not too sure why.
14.31 Liverpool will kick us off.
14.30 One S Gerrard is coming on for Liverpool. Lallana comes off.
14.28 A typical bit of Scottish refereeing has handed Rangers a second goal on a plate and it looks very much like a) Rangers are going to win at Easter Road and b) Hearts are going to win the League.
14.24 What can Liverpool do? Between this and the Spurs performance, it feels that United have stumbled upon a really formidable set-up.
45 mins: Carrick, who has been impressive, tries a shot from distance that gives Mignolet momentary cause for alarm. We're having two mins of added time, which are largely taken up with Lallana fiddling down by the corner flag. That's the half.
44 mins: Coutinho battles for the ball with Jones and goes down. I think Jones probably pushed him. It was just outside the box, but the ref gives nothing. I think they sort of pushed each other, if you see what I mean, but the superior bulk of Jones meant that it was the Brazilian who hit the deck.
43 mins: Chris Smalling, no less, powering down the right wing but failing to get a cross in.
41 mins: A strong few minutes for Liverpool. A strong few minutes for Football Cliches on one of today's linesmen.
<noframe>Twitter: Football ClichÃ©s - Hope Mike Mullarkey gets his own chat show when he retires.</noframe>
38 mins: Liverpool - and the crowd - warming to their work. Here's Sterling down the right, play switches across to the right. Lallana cannot find the right ball in. But Liverpool still have it, camped down by the corner flag. Two, now three throw ins to the Liverpool team down there.
36 mins: Fellaini clambering all over Allen. Here's Coutinho getting into things more though, linking up play and asking questions of United in their third. Henderson has a chance to open United up, Lallana's free down the middle but the ball's overhit.
34 mins: Chance! By far Liverpool's best move. A bit of midfield scrapping sees the ball break to Henderson, he looks up and spots Sturridge, picks him out with a top-class long ball. Sturridge coolly plays it into the path of Lallana who has time and space to place a shot... wide. Bad miss.
33 mins: Anyone seen Coutinho?
30 mins: Rooney picks it up and runs at the defence, his shot from distance is blocked by Martin S. Liverpool counter but Lallana's cross is too close to De Gea.
27 mins: Couple of neat bits of play from Sterling, pacy and dangerous down that right. Firm intervention from Smalling puts paid to a promising situation to which Jordan Henderson had also made contributions.
25 mins: Herera nearly wriggles through the Liverpool area but the high-bouncing ball won't quite come down for him. Nevertheless, United have a corner. Comes to nothing.
24 mins: Moreno is having a torrid time of it, Mata is giving him the run aboot.
22 mins: Gerrard thought he was getting on there for a minute but Lallana has dusted himself down and is carrying on.
20 mins: Phil Jones goes up for a header with Lallana and absolutely smashes him. I don't think Jones meant any harm, but he's cleaned out poor Adam and no mistake.
18 mins: Joe Allen goes into the book for tugging at the shirt of Herrera, who is dominating the midfield.
16 mins: First appearance by Sturridge, at least as far as I have noticed, as he gets onto a Henderson ball and attempts a techincally highly difficult volley that goes well over.
GOAL! And United now have the goal that their dominance deserves. A slick, impressive move. Fellaini carries it forward, slips it to Herrera, a raking pass forward from the centre of the park by Herrera, Mata latches onto it down the right, nice touch with the left and drills home a hard shot with his right across the keeper that goes in off the far post. Close to being offside - but I think Srktl was playing him on. LIVERPOOL 0 MANCHESTER UNITED 1 (Mata 14) Very good finish with his weaker foot.

12 mins: United controlling this match thus far.
9 mins: Herera pings it into big Marouane, he knocks it down well but Mata doesn't read the knockdown. I guess that's not really the way they teach them to play football in Spain. A Kevin Phillips would have been all over that. YOUR LOSS, PEDRO.
7 mins: United have a freekick in a useful position when Moreno gives the ball and away and fould Mata in his efforts to make amends. But Mata's curled delivery is headed clear with authority.
6 mins: An email arrives from Andrew Holgate:
It's 5 minutes in and Young hasn't dived. Is this a record?
4 mins: Visitors have made the brighter start but here is Sterling with Liverpool's best move so far, finds himself some space to run into down the right from a neat Lallana ball and the United defence seem unclear whether to go out to him or not. In the end they just do nothing and he surges into the area, stopped with some conviction by De Gea as he slides out.
3 mins: Apologies, Liverpool fans, for the hated logo obscuring the face of your centre forward - I failed to grab the screen in time.
2 mins: United able to get some balls into the Liverpool area early on, and the home defence don't deal with them especially confidently.
1 mins: Fellaini with a good powerful header early on, putting Can under pressure.
13.28 And it is United who will kick off.
13.26 Here are the visitors.

13.24 "I tended not to listen to fans, what was happening in the stands. But when you come to Anfield and they sing 'You'll Never Walk Alone', you cannot help but listen" - Thierry Henry.
13.23 Just a few minutes until kick off. The world awaits.
<noframe>Twitter: Gary Lineker - Tough to beat the atmosphere at Anfield when Liverpool play Manchester United. These games matter.</noframe>
13.18 "Steven Gerrard has been brilliant supporting the players who are in the team this week. He is a top player but he understands the needs of the team as well," B-Rodge on leaving out the leg-end.
13.15 Sensational from Pele.
<noframe>Twitter: Ken Early - did pele just crowbar a subway slogan into his first answer to geoff shreeves? you get your money's worth when you hire pele</noframe>
13.12 He likes Anfield. "When I have played against Feyenoord, I got more abuse. It was very nice coming here. The level of abuse is different in England. I like the atmosphere."
13.10 And that man Louis has issued a terrfiying warning: he wants four more years at Man United.
13.00 Here's that man Mario. God love him.

12.55 And V Valdes was on the bench in the 2010 World Cup Final wasn't he?

12.50 Two World Cup finalists on the United bench. No way past Chris 'Smartie' Smalling and Marouane 'Elbows' Fellaini though.
Actually, I am a big admirer of the boy Fellaini. This article about him by Jonathan Liew was very good.
What sort of player, exactly, is Marouane Fellaini? Deep-lying destroyer? Box-to-box lung-buster? Bony target man? Scarecrow-like decoy?
12.45 I appreciate that it's not quite the global even that this Anfield affair is, but a big game in Scotland today involving my team, Hibs, who 'welcome' Rangers to Easter Road. If Hibs fail to win, Hearts will win the title. Of the Scottish second tier. WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO SOME OF US ALRIGHT?
12.44 So two big players fail to make their respective starting XIs.: Steven Gerrard and Angel Di Maria.

12.43 Sir in the house.
<noframe>Twitter: Paul Hayward - Liverpool cabbie to Utd fan: "Where've you come from?" Fan: "Kuwait." Cabbie: "No, I mean today." Fan: "Kuwait."</noframe>
12.33 And here are those teams.
Liverpool: Mignolet, Can, Skrtel, Sakho, Henderson, Allen, Moreno, Sterling, Lallana, Coutinho, Sturridge. Subs: Jones, Johnson, Toure, Gerrard, Lambert, Lucas, Balotelli
Man United: De Gea, Valencia, Jones, Smalling, Blind, Carrick, Herrera, Mata, Fellaini, Young, Rooney. Subs: Valdes, Rafael, Rojo, Di Maria, Januzaj, A Pereira, Falcao.
12.30 Right then. Shall we find the teams?
11.45 Good morning one and all. It says something about the current status of these two great clubs when this match is essentially a battle for fourth place.
Not that the fans will care. The rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United runs deep.
Brendan Rodgers's side are the only unbeaten team left in the Premier League in 2015. Indeed their last league defeat was against Manchester United back in December. You know what they say about derbies though: formbook, window etc.
Alan Tyers will be here from around 12.30pm with all of the pre-match build-up, team news and action from Anfield.
Do join him and have a read of all our preview content on the links above, including an exclusive Henry Winter interview with Liverpool captain-in-waiting Jordan Henderson. Back soon.
