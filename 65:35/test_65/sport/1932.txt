PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” The Portland Trail Blazers selected 7-foot-1 center Meyers Leonard out of Illinois with the 11th overall pick in the NBA draft on Thursday night.

Leonard averaged 13.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as a sophomore last season before declaring early for the draft. He led the Big Ten with an average of 1.9 blocks per game.

The Blazers also selected point guard Damian Lillard out of Weber State with the sixth overall pick earlier in the night.
