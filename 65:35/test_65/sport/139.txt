Oregon State's Rasmussen throws school's 1st perfect game
CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- Drew Rasmussen tossed the first perfect game in Oregon State history, striking out 10 in a 3-0 victory over Washington State on Saturday.
It was the fourth perfect game in Pac-12 history, and first since Washington State's Joe McIntosh hurled one in 1973. The performance also marked the sixth no-hitter for Oregon State (17-5), and first since Jace Fry shut down Northern Illinois last season.
Rasmussen (3-0) needed just 103 pitches to shut down the Cougars (12-10). The freshman right-hander from Spokane, Washington, recorded six flyball outs and 11 groundball outs.
''It's been an unreal day,'' said Rasmussen, a 39th-round draft pick of Arizona last June. ''It's been awesome. It's been so much fun. Not much more I can say. Pretty surreal right now.''
KJ Harrison had an RBI single in the first inning against Joe Pistorese (1-3), and Michael Gretler and Trever Morrison drove in runs in the seventh.
