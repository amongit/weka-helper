1 Damian Traille

At the start of the Top 14 season in 2013, Damian Traille got Julien Bardy sent to the sin bin with an outrageous bit of play-of acting during Biarritz's defeat by Clermont in August 2013.
2 Simaika Mikaele

Hooper is Bathâ€™s rock
During the Marist American Samoa 7s Cup semi-final between villages Vaiala and Vailele, Simaika Mikaele makes a mockery of the image of Samoan rugby players as hard men after a pathetic fight ends him with rolling around on the floor.
3 Bryan Habana

The Toulon winger was forced into a public apology after a dive on the biggest stage in European club rugby. A chip and chase resulted in a bit of contact from Owen Farrell, and Habana collapsed like a deck of cards.
4 Yoann Huget

A cracking game between Toulouse and Bath as the Champions Cup group stages reaches fever pitch, until a touch from Horacio Agulla takes Huget down and farcical scenes ensue.
