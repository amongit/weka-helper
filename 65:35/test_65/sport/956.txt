Shane Sutton questions hunger as Britain fail to win a single gold medal at Track Cycling World Championships

Perhaps it was the proximity of France’s new national velodrome to the Palace of Versailles, but there was a whiff of revolution in the air at the Track Cycling World Championships in Paris last week. It certainly felt like the end of another Ancien Régime.
Track cycling’s aristocrats for much of the past decade, it is now abundantly clear that Great Britain’s reign is over.
The warning signs were there in Colombia last year when the men returned without a medal. This time there were only eyebrows raised.
The eight Olympic cycling gold medals that Team GB took in Beijing, and seven in London four tears later, were extraordinary, never-to-be-repeated feats. British fans must learn henceforth to adjust their expectations. Not too much, though.
The smaller nations may have risen up but Great Britain are still one of the best-funded squads in the world, if not the best, with £30 million in Lottery funding for the four-year cycle up to 2017. So it is entirely right that they should face probing questions after their least successful Track Cycling World Championships for 14 years.

Shane Sutton, British Cycling’s technical director, made it abundantly clear beforehand that his riders were in Paris “to be judged”; that there would be no hiding behind excuses should they fail to perform. Frankly, three silver medals was nowhere near good enough for a squad of Great Britain’s resources and ambition.
Yes there were positives. Great Britain were edged into silver in both the men’s and the women’s team pursuit squads but there is no cause for undue alarm there; the men improved hugely on their showing the previous year while the women set a personal best (at sea level) in the final despite Joanna Rowsell being off colour. Both teams are right in the hunt for gold medals in Rio.
Laura Trott also continues to look a good bet for gold in the omnium next summer, although she is having to shoulder a heavy load and the worry is that it may start to wear too heavily on her.
However, it was not just the lack of medals. Medal tallies can be deceptive. The problem is the fact that Great Britain got nowhere near the podium in the sprint events on either the men’s or the women’s side. It was the fact that Jason Kenny – a triple Olympic champion – exited both the sprint and keirin in the first round. Our sprinters are now in danger of having to travel to far-flung corners of the globe this winter to have to qualify.
“I think there are certain riders who probably just need to look at their 'hunger’ a little bit,” Sutton said. “If anything’s going to make them hungry it’s the way they performed here. Just one or two riders in the group – who need to [ask] has the journey come to an end for them or are they still hungry for it?”

No prizes for guessing that Kenny was one of the riders to whom Sutton was referring, although publicly the Australian defended his star sprinter.
“My belief in Jason won’t go away,” said Sutton, adding that he believed the 26-year-old was suffering from a lack of competition in training.
“In the old days, every day he was coming in and he was competing against [Chris Hoy] and they were beating each other up on a daily basis. He doesn’t have that any more. I personally believe Jason needs to race a bit more.”
The other person to whom Sutton was referring was probably Jess Varnish, Britain’s senior female sprinter in Paris. Although Varnish set a personal best in sprint qualifying during the week, she never really threatened the medals. The return of Becky James, Great Britain’s double world champion in Minsk in 2013, cannot come soon enough but may never happen at all.
James is only just getting back on her bike following a lengthy knee injury. Sutton did not mention her name when looking at potential medals next year.
“Listen, if we can go to Rio and bring five medals away in the track programme, we’d be over the moon,” Sutton said. “We won three medals in Paris, three Olympic medals.
“If Mark Cavendish wants to line up in the omnium, or Ben Swift, or Ed Clancy, then that is a fourth medal [potentially]. The fifth one I think we will be very competitive in – and you guys might sit here and say 'no chance’ – is the men’s team sprint. I don’t care what anybody says. I know we are at the races.”
Sutton, who had the thankless task of taking over from Sir Dave Brailsford last April, believes he has earned himself a bit of time given his key role as head coach during the golden years. And he has.
It would be unfair to judge him before he or his team have had time to properly bed in.
He has made some big appointments on the coaching side, bringing in Heiko Salzwedel (men’s endurance) and Justin Grace (sprint), bringing back Paul Manning (women’s endurance), moving Chris Newton back to the academy, promoting Iain Dyer to head coach.
He still has a number of things on his to-do list: finding a psychologist, a Laura Trott-esque gem in the academy and a couple of French sprinters with British passports would not be a bad start.
“We’re not looking at anyone’s passports,” Sutton said with a laugh. “We have total confidence in the group that we’ve got and we will turn this around.”
Eight things technical director must do to get Britain back on track
1. Develop a 'man three’ in the men’s team sprint Great Britain already have two thirds of a gold-medal winning team sprint. Unfortunately Callum Skinner was unable to keep pace with London 2012 champions Philip Hindes and Jason Kenny in Paris – and that was despite them trying to ride slower. Sutton needs either Skinner or Kian Emadi to fill Sir Chris Hoy’s cleats or this is one gold he can kiss goodbye.
2. Find a 'bolter’ Laura Trott only appeared on our radars at the 2011 track worlds, one year before London 2012, while Hindes left it even later, until the 2012 track worlds in Melbourne, to nail his place in the men’s team sprint. Could there be another ’bolter’ out there? Sutton seems to think not, naming young sprinter Dani Khan as “a nugget” but saying that it Rio may come too soon for her.
3. Get Becky James fit If Khan cannot step up, then it is doubly important to get Becky James fit. For all the wailing and gnashing of teeth at our sprint failures in Paris, we have a double world champion out there in her prime age-wise. James has only just restarted training after a long spell out with a knee injury. Neither her return, nor the level she might return at, is at all certain.
4. Bring on young talent such as Marchant and Gibson Whether James makes it or not, Great Britain must develop the young talent that they do have. Katy Marchant has switched from training with Jessica Ennis-Hill in the heptathlon and apparently her raw numbers are impressive. Matt Gibson broke through in Paris with a fine sixth place in the scratch. Both need to be pushing the established seniors.
5. Convince Cavendish (and/or Swift or Kennaugh) to return Cavendish may have poured cold water on his chances of a track return in Rio, but Sutton is still secretly hoping the lure of Olympic gold will prove too great to resist. Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh are also considering returns. The more the merrier as far as Sutton is concerned. They would all help to increase Britain’s medal potential.
6. Find a team psychologist The departure of Steve Peters [of Chimp Paradox fame] last year may have been even more significant than that of Sir Dave Brailsford. ’Psychology’ is an area that Sutton remains keen to exploit. He says he wants to toughen up his riders. He has even been to see the SAS. But he has not yet announced the right person to head up this area. This could be a key apppointment.
7. Give Kenny a kick up backside – his country needs him now Kenny has won three golds from two Olympics, yet he has won only two world titles despite having competed in eight track worlds. It is all very well saying “Kenny will come good in Rio” but in the meantime, his inconsistency is a source of huge frustration and dents the confidence of the squad as a whole. Sutton needs his star sprinter to man up.
8. Get Wiggins back and setting the tone Sir Bradley Wiggins has announced his intention to try to make the team pursuit squad in Rio and end his career with one last gold. It may be frustrating for GB coaches that he is waiting until after June to join the group, but wait they will. Why? Because it is Wiggins. A fit and firing Wiggo would be the standard bearer, the inspiration, a rallying point.
