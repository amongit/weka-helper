Carmelo Anthony Takes Cheap Shot To Groin From Facundo Campazzo Of Argentina
The U.S. men's basketball team throttled its opponents from Argentina on Monday night in London but it may have been one of the Americans who felt the sharpest pain during the Group A game.
After letting loose a three-point shot during a U.S. outburst in the third quarter, Carmelo Anthony was the victim of what looked a lot like an intentional cheap shot from Facundo Campazzo, the Argentine player defending him on the play.
A replay of the action reveals Campazzo sticking his arm out as Anthony comes down after the shot. He jabs Anthony in the groin, causing him to fall to the ground. The reaction to the play on Twitter came before Anthony could even get back to his feet.
Several on the U.S. bench started barking about the play but no one was more furious by the foul than coach Mike Krzyzewski, who was arguing with Argentina forward Luis Scola near the scorer's table until referees intervened.

According to Ian Begley of ESPNNewYork.com, the cheap shot may have been in retaliation to a hit Campazzo suffered earlier in the game at the hands of Chris Paul. Frank Isola of the New York Daily News tweeted that Campazzo accused Paul of punching him and apologized to Kobe Bryant after the game, but didn't apologize to Anthony because "Chris Paul didn't apologize to me."
After the U.S. won 126-97, Tyson Chandler didn't mince words when asked about the incident.
This post has been updated to include additional information about Chris Paul's role in the incident.
