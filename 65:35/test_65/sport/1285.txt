Samir Nasri has claimed Luis Suarez must accept playing a secondary role to Lionel Messi at Barcelona after describing the Argentine forward as "from another galaxy".
Suarez is set to play in England on Tuesday for the first time since completing a £75-million transfer from Liverpool to Barcelona last summer with the Spanish giants facing Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 first-leg tie at the Etihad.
The Uruguayan striker has scored just seven goals for Barca in 22 appearances since returning from a worldwide ban in October for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup.
But with Messi already in situ at the Nou Camp, City midfielder Nasri insists that even a player of Suarez’s calibre cannot expect to be the "main man" alongside the Barcelona captain.
“I think it is different,” former French international Nasri said. “At Liverpool, he [Suarez] was the main striker, but you are not going to score 70 goals playing for Barcelona because he makes a lot of assists and opens up space for Messi and Neymar.

“He is good, he just doesn’t score as much for Barcelona.
“At Liverpool, the team was built around him, but at Barcelona you cannot do that when you have Messi in his prime.
“When you arrive at a big club, you have to deal with things like that.”
Despite being perceived to have endured a difficult season at Barcelona, Messi has scored 37 goals in 34 appearances for Luis Enrique’s team.
And Nasri admits that the 27-year-old is on another level to all but Cristiano Ronaldo, the Real Madrid forward, in terms of his ability.

“I think Messi and Ronaldo play in their own galaxy,” Nasri said. “They compete with each other.
“The rest, Suarez and Neymar, are the same level as Sergio [Aguero]. Sergio, when he is fit, can lift the team and score goals.
“I just think that Messi is on another galaxy.”
