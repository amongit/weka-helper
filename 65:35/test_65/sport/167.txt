Earthquakes open new home with 2-1 win over Fire
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Fatai Alashe and Ty Harden scored goals in the first half and the San Jose Earthquakes opened their new stadium with a 2-1 win over the Chicago Fire on Sunday night.
Goalie David Bingham made three saves for the Earthquakes (2-1). San Jose has won back-to-back games after going winless in its previous 16.
The setting was perfect, too - a sellout crowd on hand for the official opening of Avaya Stadium, the $100 million gem financed by Earthquakes owners John Fisher and Lew Wolff.
Harrison Shipp scored the lone goal for Chicago (0-3). The Fire had been shut out in their first two games and trailed the entire game.
