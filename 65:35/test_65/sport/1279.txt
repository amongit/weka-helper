Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool (1-1 on aggregate) Besiktas win 5-4 on penalties
I think Besiktas probably deserved that given the second half and most of extra-time. Whether it was tiredness that caught up with Liverpool or whether Brendan Rodgers was too slow to adjust will be a matter of some debate. But let's not overlook how well Arslan did when he came on and Slaven Bilic's positive instructions after the break. Thanks for your company tonight. Good night We'll have a match report from Luke Edwards in Istanbul and all the reaction on the site imminently at www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/

Besiktas are going first - Demba Ba.
20.32 We're back, mercifully.
ITV4 has just gone to a blank screen. Perfect timing.
120 min The whistles are ear-splitting now. Twenty seconds left and Liverpool have a throw 10 yards from the goalline but take it short and play for the only whistle they're waiting for. And there it is. Penalties it shall be.
119 min More territory from Liverpool, pinning Besiktas back up the left with Lambert's houndingand Lallana's running.
117 min Liverpool have never lost a penalty shootout in European competition says The Matterface. 1984, 2005. Any more?
115 min Karim links up well with Ba through the middle, taking a pass from Tore and turning it into Ba's stride. He's 18 yards out and spoons his shot over the bar. Karim, or Karim Frei as he was at Tott-ing-ham, is unimpressed by Ba's decision and execution.
114 min Besiktas corner won by Tore whose cross aimed for Ba was blocked but Liverpool stay calm from the set-piece despite the piercing volume as the ball came in.
113 min Opare goes on a foal-like mazy run up the right, never wholly in control but making masses of ground until Allen gets across to slide in and stop his progress with a good interception.
111 min Kurtulus makes a break up the right but is dogged relentlessly by Sterling so he has to stop and tap it infield for Arslan instead of storming up the touchline. It allows Liverpool to regroup. Excellent responsibilty there from Sterling in terms of doing his duty.
109 min Lallana takes a weird one, a very lofted chip to the back stick where Ba gets up to beat Lovren to it. More pace less height required.
107 min Kerim is caught offside after an inadvertent touch by Kavlak. It allows Liverpool to stem the tide by launching a free-kick 60 yards upfield for Sterling who is felled and wins a free-kick on the right 20-odd yards out.
106 min Lambert replaces Sturridge at the break and Kerim Koyunlu comes on for Olcay Sahan.
105+1 min Better end of the first half of extra time from Liverpool in terms of territory, keeping a higher line, but there is much work to be done to make it to penalties. Half-time, the sequel.
105 min Liverpool look knackered - Sterling made a promising dart to link up with Sturridge but when he needed help there was no one coming.
103 min Outrageous dive from Can trying to win a breather via a free-kick when his heavy touchknocked it too far past Necip. Yellow card ensues.
101 min Can drops with cramp after overstretching in a footrace with Olcay Sahan who again finds Ba in spac to the right of the box. He cuts it back fot Tore who scuffs a low shot at Mignolet. It seems like they can't hold out for the next 19 minutes like this.
99 min Hutchinson lengthens his stride and rolls a pass to the left of the D Sahan who lays it off into Ba who had just strayed offside then 20 seconds later Ba's back in behind the defence and Mignolet blocks his shot angled across goal and Skrtel boots it clear.
97 min Liverpool continue to live dangerously as the time takes its toll on their legs. The signs of improvement that Lallana's introduction brought haven't survived since the end of the first ninety minutes.
95 min Opare gets an opportunity to shoot that his midfielders were gorging on in the second half, scudding a right-foot shot from 20 yards past Mignolet's left post. The keeper nonchalantly watched it rip ... a foot ... past.
92 min Arslan wins a foul off Can who shoves him in the back. He has made a huge difference since coming on, the cross between the Arsenal manager and CS Lewis's God figure.
91 min Spurs and Celtic are out. Can Liverpool survive?
Extra time
90+3 min That's it. We'll have extra time. A game of two halves indeed. Liverpool grew into the first half and played with a certain assuredness that Besiktas didn't allow them to have after the break. Thirty more minutes are coming.
90+2 min The corner is headed on at the near post on to Skrtel's thigh and it drops to Ba five yards out and he blisters his shot straight on to the bar with such force that you can still hear it twanging like a bass tuning fork. What power ... but what a miss, too.
90 min Three minutes of stoppage time are coming. Arslan does brilliantly with a 20-yard dribble, doing a 360 as well as benefitting from a fortunate flick off Toure to win a corner.
89 min Besiktas throw on the right, parallel with the 18-yard line. Hutchinson and Kurtulus can't work it betweem them and Liverpool shovel the ball away from danger.
87 min Besiktas now break in numbers and camp out 30 yards from Liverpool's goal, Kurtulus shoots straight into Lovren's face and Ba then shanks his shot wide.
85 min At last Liverpool manage a spell of possession and it provokes the most intense whistling of the half. Lallana gives and goes but he can't properly control Moreno's return over the heads of the defence and has to knock it out for a throw rather than ove away a goalkick.
83 min Sturridge, who hasn't played well, ruins a move when his throughball for Manquillo's peel up the right is underhit. That was a rare glimpse of goal this half.
81 min Lallana comes on for Balotelli. Obviously not planning on penalties.*
(*Au contraire Nostradamus)
80 min Another mistake by Manquillo gives the ball to Tore but the right back races back to win a tackle and take the ball back.
79 min Manquillo's first touch is a header that bumbles off his forhead and out for a corner. He was untroubled but didn't hear the call. Liverpool cope with it well, though, and Sterling powers out of defence and wins a free-kick when he's held up.
77 min Now he is - Manquillo replaces Ibe.
75 min Liverpool look like wilting despite going 5-3-2. They need some possession but Brendan Rodgers is uncharacteristically not doing anything to redress the imbalance.
GOAL! Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool (Arslan) It's been coming and coming. They've been allowed to shoot at will but this was special, a left-foot curler from the edge of the D when Ba's inadvertent flick fell just infront of Skrtel. They needed a defensive midfielder on after an hour. But Rodgers has hesitated.
72 min There's no pressing in central midfield or by the back three which is allowing Besiktas to get several shots off this half. This time Arslan comes closest of all with a fizzer from 22 yards that scuds past the diving Mignolet's left post.
70 min Moreno has to be on guard and is , taking responsibility to track back into the box and make a vital intervention when the ball fell for Arslan after first Ba and then Tore were only an inch or so away from a perfect shooting opportunity as the ball ran across them.
67 min Now it's Skrtel who stops Besiktas getting an effort on goal with a towering header out for a corner. The momentum is running so strongly against them now that Rodgers is going to have to make a change.
65 min But then he slides in to stop a crossfield pass arrive at Tore's feet 20 yards out after Lovren dillies, dallies and loses the ball. Toure gives him an earful. Liverpool have to get back on the front foot.
63 min I nearly jinxed Toure then because he sat back when Tore, his kinsman but for a 'u', ran at him and wasn't closed down. Hence he had an opportunity to shoot from 20 yards which he did, spearing a shot a foot over the bar.
62 min Toure is doing OK, looking after Tore, stopping him making any progress behind Ibe. Liverpool generally though, just haven't clicked this half.
61 min Besiktas make the first change, bringing Arslan on to play behind Ba and replacing Sosa.
60 min Both Sterling and Balotelli require treatment, the latter after Opare stands on his achilles. Sterling stopped when there was no one near him but he is jogging around now.
59 min Over in Firenze, Fiorentina have taken a 1-0 lead. Spurs need to score twice now.
57 min Corner for Liverpool taken by Allen deep. Lovren gets up but is 15 yards out and floats a header that Gonen pouches without disturbance.
55 min Kavlak rolls around on the floor after Balotelli throws out an arm to hold him off and pushes his shoulder before his finger rebounds accidentally into thye Besiktas midfielder's face. It wasn't deliberate or malicious though and the referee kneels to coak Kavlak back up to his feet.
53 min Besiktas have tweaked their tactics with more emphasis on using the space in front of the three central defenders because Joe Allen can't deal with more than one attacker at a time. First Olcay floats in a deep cross from the right that Ibe has to backpedal to head clear then Tore fires a shot from 20 yards that Mignolet deals with easily again.
50 min A high aerial shot shows Liverpool's system perfectly - when they haven't got the ball they are lining up 5-3-2 with Sterling dropping into midfield. Over on the left Kurtulus finds some space and lashes a shot from 25 yards that Mignolet dives to claim fairly comfortably even though he hit it well.
49 min Slaven Bilic is deeply unhappy, gesticulating on the touchline.
46 min Besiktas have come out with more intent and attempt a raid up the right but Liverpool see it out. It prompts Kavlak to claim Joe Allen's high boot caught him on the forehead but Ronnie Whelan says it was the ball that hit him.

Scarfers eh? (Getty)
18.56 Pundits are predictably worried that Balotelli might overstep the mark in the second half. Bah. He's playing well and being subjected to seem real rough-housing. Liverpool have been impressive so far apart from Sterling's first touch once or twice and Sturridge's reluctance to shoo with his right foot.

Mario Balotelli tells Necip not to dish it out if he can't take it ... or words to that effect (Getty)
Half time A second after Can won the throw he was walking off. The ref whistled for half-time before anything good could come of it.
44 min Good spell of possession from Liverpool, switching it across field three times as they looked to probe behind the full-backs. Can finally takes the initiative to burst past Opare down the left to win a throw. He's got an impressively long stride and decent acceleration.
41 min Excellent work from Ibe clearing up after Mignolet got down low to his right to save from Olcay's firm shot. Ibe takes it up the other end and feeds Balotelli 35 yards out and he cannot resist the temptation to shoot, getting underneath it and sending it into orbit.
40 min Balotelli takes the last of the three free-kicks himself and it's a belter, a viciously whipped cross through the six-yard box but no Liverpool player had made the most obvious run.
37 min Operation Wind-up Mario is in full effect, Franco slapping him across the head, then slides across him to catch him on the ankle and concede a free-kick 20 yards out, to the right of the box. Those two assaults came withing 30 seconds and only a minute after Necip had gone through him.
35 min Moreno receives the last pass of a one-two to open up a narrow shooting channel on the angle of the area towards the near post as Kurtulus scrambled back. The left wing-back drew his foot back and managed to poke it on target but with not enough power to drill it under Gonen who blocked it with his legs.
32 min Good partnership play from Balotelli to draw his defender and roll it across the 18-yard line for Sturridge to shoot ... but he took a touch that forced him out to the right and then he had to take another touch to try to open a shooting opportunity on his left. Three touches with the outside of his left boot rather than whack it with his right took him into a crowd of retreating defenders and the chance was gone.
30 min Another quarter-chance for Sterling through a thicket of legs in the Besiktas box, hit not very crisply with his left. Out it goes for a corner which is stuck right on Skrtel's Mount Rushmore-scale brow. He leapt to meet it almost perfectly and completely nawsed it up, booming it over the bar.
27 min Neither side can keep the ball for sustained attacks - Can gives it away and forces Sterling into a fould to stop Besiktas breaking up the right seconds after Opare let in Sturridge in the box. The quality of the bounce though for Sturridge was dreadfully difficult to control, making him scamper after it as it veered away from him.
25 min Sterling has an opportunity after a pass from Can opens up the defence and finds him on the right of the box. His first touch is heavy though and forces him to stop and turn his right shoulder infield to control it. By the time he's done this Kurtulus and Sosa have flooded back into the box to close him down and he has to offload it instead across the six-yard area where no Liverpool player had ventured.
23 min Scratch that comment about Lovren finding some form - he has just made a hospital pass that, had Ba controlled it better, would and should have been punished.
21 min Moreno makes a dart up the left and fortuitously beats Kutulus in the tackle, the ball bobbling off his hip into the stride of Sterling lurking in the D. He shoots first time at about knee height for Cenk Gonen. the keeper dives to his left to parry away with firm forearms.
19 min Besiktas corner after diligent defensive work from Skrtel which comes to nothing as Franco flashes a Hollywood shot over the bar from a distance commentators are contractually bound to call 'range'.
17 min Hutchinson plays a long diagonal over the top of the Liverpool defence with Ba nipping in behind them. Skrtel and Lovren are wise to it, though - it's the third time they've tried to catch them out so far - and both retreat to smother the space infront of Mignolet.
15 min Sterling and Ibe link up on the right and the former wellies in a cross towards Sturridge who is cutting into the box from the left about 15 yards from goal. Out come Kurtulus and Necip to challenge him and clear.
13 min Ronnie Whelan, the co-commentator, poses the usual criticism of Balotelli - can you trust him not to do anything daft. I think that's unfair. There are a lot of iffy tackles flying in tonight so far, from both sides. The atmosphere, the noise and the smoke, virtually demands it.
11 min Yellow card for Balotelli who lunged in on Kavlak who was trying to outsprint him up the right touchline. Instead Balotelli took him out at shin-height.
10 min Jordon Ibe again in the action, tracking all the way back to get between Ba and Sahan to make an interception.
8 min Good tackle from Lovren mirrors a dinked pass he made to Can a minute earlier. He looks to be finding some form. Ibe loses the ball on the right after being crowded out by Oparea and Hutchinson. Positive start from Liverpool, though, zipping passes around.
7 min Nice turn from Can, plays it out to Ibe on the right for Sahan to foul.
5 min Just to avoid misunderstanding, the whistling is provoked by the colour of shirts - red - rather than skin. They are howling at every Liverpool touch.
3 min Quick offload from Allen in the centre-circle to Can who chips a 30-yard diagonal over to the left where Balotelli chases it with Kurtulus who he shoves in the back, very gently, as they get to the edge of the box. The crowd goes all Roger Whitaker again.
2 min A huge amount of booing and whistling as Balotelli goes down when studded down the calfs by Uysal as he launched himself through the centre-forward.
1 min Tore has it in the centee of the park for Besiktas and helps the ball back to Gonen who belts it long up the middle.
17.58 There are some people on the pitch ... it's the teams. Time to big up some bookmakers on the box.
17.48 Good evening again properly. Well Liverpool's 3-4-3 looks pretty enticing and with Can restored to midfield. This must be the first time that Balotelli and Sturridge have linked up from the start since that Spurs game. I wonder how Atiba Hutchinson will cope with Can in a more advanced position. Sam Allardyce was reportedly after the Canada midfielder back in January but at 32 I would have thought his Premier League ambition hace very little chance of fulfilment.
17.08 We have some team news for you. And Mario Balotelli starts:
Besiktas Gonen; Kurtulus, Necip Uysal, Franco, Opare; Veli Kavlak, Hutchinson; Tore, Sosa, Sahan; Ba. Subs Fidayeo, Pektemek, Ozyakup, Arslan, Frei, Boral, Nukan.
Liverpool Mignolet; Toure, Lovren, Skrtel; Ibe, Can, Allen, Moreno; Sterling, Balotelli, Sturridge. Subs Ward, Lambert, Manquillo, Lallana, Borini, Brannagan, Williams.
Referee Damir Skomina (Slovenia)
16.30 Liverpool, quite understandably, are proud of their pre-eminence among English clubs in the European Cup. Those five 'big-eared b-------' from 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005 are truly something worth boasting about. Good grief, some people make such a fuss about one and I speak as someone who has seen their club play in a final and semi-final and is now, because of what has happened to the finances of the game, further away from winning it than at any point over the past seven decades. And yet, the one downside of celebrating those five stars, is that it utterly overshadows Liverpool's fine record in this competition. Victories in 1973 and 1976 were extremely hard-fought battles and the third in 2001 a barmy, compelling occasion that rounded off a historic season in style.

Of course, the integrity of the cup has been compromised since 1999 when Uefa took the decision to parachute eight Champions League failures into the round of 32 (Liverpool being a beneficiary this season). No amount of rebranding or rescheduling of the fixture list to give the teams a fair chance of coverage in the unfamiliar territory of Thursday nights has redressed that anomaly. But too many teams over the years have slaved to get into this competition then promptly treated it as an encumbrance. Competition snobbery is ill-becoming. Cups are better than cash. Yes, I know getting into the top four is Liverpool's only priority but I hope they give tonight and the rest of the tournament thir best shot, if only to emphasise again that there is more to the long, rich history of European football than one overblown competition. And then they could have four, what, embroidered vase motifs, to go with their proudly cherished five stars.
