Cricket World Cup 2015: Martin Guptill leads New Zealand to semis
Guptill's score was the second best in one-day international history behind Rohit Sharma's 264 and propelled the Black Caps to the highest total in a World Cup knockout match.
Having ended a run of 21 innings without a century in New Zealand's previous match against Bangladesh, he became the fifth player to make an ODI double hundred.
He joined Indians Sharma, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, and Gayle in the exclusive club.
His effort was also the fourth highest score in all List A cricket - limited-overs games that are not Twenty20s.

Opener Guptill, who was dropped on four by Marlon Samuels, already held the record for the best ODI score by a New Zealander, having made an unbeaten 189 against England in 2013.
But this effort, played out in front of a raucous Wellington crowd in a home quarter-final, ensured his place in World Cup and New Zealand cricket history.
It was a performance befitting the excitement in a country where the World Cup feels like a bigger deal than across the Tasman Sea in Australia. Whereas Australia has struggled to fill its vast grounds, New Zealand has matched size of venue to magnitude of match to be rewarded with capacity crowds and lively atmospheres.

The right-hander, who began by driving the first ball of the innings for four, heaved six after six over the leg-side boundary after reaching his century.
The 10th of his sixes went out of the ground and landed on the roof of the "Cake Tin" stadium.
He shared a partnership of 143 with Ross Taylor, whose patient 42 was the second highest score in the Kiwi innings.
Guptill, who made his second hundred from only 41 balls, beat the previous best World Cup knockout score of 149 by Australia's Adam Gilchrist.
He also became the first New Zealander to score hundreds in consecutive World Cup innings and the first of his countrymen to bat through the full 50 overs three times in ODIs.
Gayle became the first man to make a World Cup double hundred against Zimbabwe in Canberra on 24 February.
But his record lasted only 25 days, with Gayle congratulating Guptill on the field when the New Zealander surpassed his score.
Man-of-the-match Martin Guptill: "It's a pretty cool feeling to be fair. We had a couple of good partnerships early to set us up to explode at the end.
"We were trying to take each ball as it comes and rotate the strike. We did that well and it worked out.
"After I got 100 I thought I should hit some boundaries. It was the quickest outfield I have played on here and you got value for shots.
"It was an incredible crowd. We will let this one sink in tonight and focus on the semi-finals tomorrow. We have work to do so I can't focus on it too much."

Former New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney: "Martin Guptill dazzled. He turned this stadium into a little carnival. He hit the ball so cleanly, drives that you've never seen anything like. He thoroughly deserves all the accolades he's getting."
Former India batsman Rahul Dravid: "It was incredible. Unbelievable. Some of the hitting after he reached 100â€¦ you were surprised when it didn't go for a four or six - that became an event. Everything was in the zone, no matter where West Indies bowled it. Some of the sixes were huge."
