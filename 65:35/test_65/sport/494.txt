Super Bowl commercials are big business, with companies paying a huge amount of money to advertise their products in front of the biggest television audience of the year in the US.
Brands paid up to a record $4.5 million for 30 seconds of airtime during Sunday Night's Super Bowl XLIX game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona.
But it is not just the game itself that provides and opportunity for companies to promote their goods.
In the days and weeks leading up to the event, many brands – notably snack foods and drinks – market their products as the perfect accompaniment to the biggest sporting night of the year in America.
This year, the comedy show Saturday Night Live chose to record a spoof advert, making fun of the cliché that men are interested in watching the game, while their wives and girlfriends prefer to stay in the kitchen and prepare food.

In the sketch, a woman waits on her husband and his friends as they watch the football, making sure that they have enough snacks and beer.
"When it comes to the big game, I love feeding my hungry guys," she says. "But ... now what?
"I normally just sit in the kitchen, waiting for them to ask for more delicious Totino's pizza rolls, but that can be so boring.
"Well not any more!" she adds, holding up a spoof "activity pack" for bored women.
She goes on to demonstrate the pack, which includes a dot-to-dot puzzle and word-search amongst other things.
The studio audience can be heard laughing uproariously at the sketch, which has been viewed more than half a million times since it was posted on YouTube on Sunday.
