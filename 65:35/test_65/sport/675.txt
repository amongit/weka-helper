Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri quits international football with France

Samir Nasri has made his decision. After 41 caps and a continually fractious relationship he has quit international football and is no longer available to play for France.
Only just 27 – his birthday is in June – it is an absurdly premature end for such a talented player, even if there will be an added benefit for his club, Manchester City.
“Yes I’ve made it,” Nasri says when asked whether he is certain of his decision. “I was thinking about it in 2012 after the [European] Championship and now it’s just a confirmation of what I was thinking.
“I have just turned 27 but let’s face it, let’s be honest, as long as he [coach Didier Deschamps] is going to be the manager I don’t think I have a shot after everything that has happened.
“In 2016 I will be 29 and will have a chance to play in the European Championships (in France) but the French national team doesn’t make me happy.

“Every time I go there, there is just like more trouble. I face accusations about me, and my family suffers from it and I don’t want to make them suffer, so it’s better to stop it and focus on my club career.”
That club career has been spectacularly successful, especially since his £24 million move from Arsenal to City has yielded two Premier League titles and an FA Cup success, even if it was a move that caused such friction with supporters of his former club.
Nasri, like the others who have swapped north London for east Manchester, has faced sustained abuse, and says it would be “stupid” of Arsenal supporters to continue to boo him, not least because “I am not an Arsenal fan, I am not from London” and dismisses any notion that his move amounted to “treason”.
For Nasri it was a logical professional step which has led to trophies – even if he is not in the business of pointing to his medals as means of vindication. “I don’t think it would be nice for me to do that. I am trying to be more mature and not to be involved in those things because I have had a lot of problems in the past. To say ‘Look, I have won these trophies’ is not nice towards them [the fans].”
Although he gets his argument across, Nasri does not want to fuel any feud. “I am in debt to Arsène Wenger at Arsenal,” he says. “I am this player today because of him.
But I don’t think I need to explain myself and what I did with Manchester City should be enough and I don’t have to print it all the time.”
Nasri is, nevertheless, a candid, plain-speaker and his omission from France’s World Cup squad by Deschamps sparked controversy – not least when the player’s English-born girlfriend Anara Atanes used Twitter to vent her own anger in such an aggressive, obscene way that the coach was said to be considering legal action in reply. The omission meant that instead of being in Brazil, Nasri – and Atanes – enjoyed an extended summer break, although he watched all of France’s games during the tournament.
“It wasn’t hard. I had a great break. That’s life,” he says. “He [Deschamps] said I wasn’t happy when I was on the bench. I don’t know one player who is happy when he’s on the bench, especially when you don’t understand the reason.
“I am not bitter. I watched all of France’s games in the World Cup because I love football. It’s not going to make me hate it.”
That passion for the game may be undimmed but neither will he compromise. “I love everything about football and I just want to have as much pleasure as possible and with the French national team I don’t feel like it anymore, so it’s better to be focused on Manchester City,” Nasri says.
His decision will certainly be to City’s benefit. “I think I can improve, you can always improve and I want to improve this year because we want to do better in the Champions League so everyone has to step up a little bit,” Nasri explains. “But last year if I couldn’t make the French national team, I don’t know what more could I do.”
That part of his career may be over – at least while Deschamps is in charge – but there is much to achieve still at City who stood accused of easing off two seasons ago when they failed to retain the title. And, as Nasri says, they need to do better in Europe.
The Premier League challengers this time round are gathering – with Arsenal among them although, again with typical candour, Nasri says his former club still have obvious deficiencies.
“They have a weakness at defensive midfield and centre-back,” Nasri says. “But they will be dangerous.” Not least, he says, because they have signed “a great player” in £35 million Alexis Sánchez.
The champions addressed some of their defensive problems this summer with the arrival of midfielder Fernando and French defender Eliaquim Mangala (still to be confirmed) from Porto for more than £40 million, goalkeeper Willy Cabellero to provide competition for Joe Hart and Bacary Sagna from Arsenal.
“We have improved the squad with some players at the back because last year that was our weakness,” Nasri says.
Manchester United – partly because they are not involved in European competition – Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur will also be threats but it is Chelsea whom Nasri regards as the strongest challengers to City’s crown.
“Cesc Fabregas will be the guy to replace Frank Lampard,” Nasri says of his former team-mate. “He is a great player, I know I was with him at Arsenal. They [Chelsea] had a weakness up front and signed Diego Costa who had a great season. They lost Ashley Cole and they signed Filipe Luis. They have done it really fast as well so the players have spent a lot of time together. They will be really dangerous.”
For today’s encounter neither City nor Arsenal will be at full-strength – with World Cup players still to return (Arsenal’s three German World Cup winners are due back on Monday) – although Nasri dismisses any notion that it will be “a glorified friendly”. “There is a trophy and playing Arsenal is always something special,” he says.
