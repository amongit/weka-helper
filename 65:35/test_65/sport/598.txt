FULL TIME: ENGLAND 1 DENMARK 0 Not the worst England friendly, but all pretty familiar stuff. The bigger names didn't really do anything to write home about, the defence looked short of class, several players (the wandering Wayne, Sturridge the friendly left-back) seemed a bit unsure about where they were supposed to be, or maybe that's where they had been told to play. I don't know. A strictly limited Denmark side played okay, goalie had a good game, the Danes had a couple of very decent chances. Once England got some of their exciting young players on the ball, and got a few men in the box, they managed to nick one. That upturn also coincided with Rooney coming off: make of that what you will.
Impossible to have any confidence whatsoever about England playing well against anyone any good, but nice to see some of the talented youngsters (Shaw, Lallana, Sterling) getting a crack. Those last two, especially, have certainly done their claims a lot of good, but the team's weak spots are glaring. Thanks for following it with us, we'll just grab a few more of your emails and then I'll bid you goodnight.
Here's Søren H. Assmann:
IWell, you're GOING to the World Cup, which already trumps Denmark's performance. Still, where did you find that Lallana? Man plays with heart. Seems the jersey means something to him. So, take him with ya. Can leave Rooney home for that. Three strikers are enough, and Rooney's performance this year and in the jersey as of late doesn't make him an auto-pick.
William Kalua writes:
Gerrard has been a loyal servant to England and has performed reasonably well for them and he is in the side not because of his club form.
And let's give Mike Turney the last word:
So I guess that Italy should get rid of Pirlo, Spain should get rid of Xavi? It's not Gerrards fault that England Have been useless- same as it's not his fault Liverpool have been useless. Under the score – you have “ England should follow the Liverpool way” That does allow for a mixture of youth and experience.
90+ mins: Denmark have a late freekick which Danny Olsen whips across the area. That was really close to getting touched in! Would have been a party pooper. That's the final whistle.
90 mins: Think the following is a fair sum-up of England's progress, such as it is.
<noframe>Twitter: Paul Hayward - No need to get giddy, but still fair to say several English players have come on a lot this season. Lallana, Sturridge, Sterling, Shaw etc.</noframe>
87 mins: James Milner comes on for Sturridge.
86 mins: Denmark nearly burst that bubble of optimism with a strong long shot that doesn't go far wide. I was too busy trying to keep track of England's rolling subs thing to see who hit it. Somebody-sen, I think. Danny Olsen, if I had to declare.
84 mins: Raheem Sterling, who has been England's brightest spot for my money, comes off and Andros Townsend comes on. An email from Michael Hutson:
I agree that there is a need for youth, for sure. But keeping Gerrard makes sense. He anchors the young lads psychologically, bringing experience and memories of past big games and moments of holding your nerve. He also anchors the young spokes of the wheel mechanically: with fast paced players like Lallana and Sterling joining the ranks, having someone with Gerrard's passing accuracy/sight is a different sort of play than England have been able to strive for in recent years.
Suzanne Ward, though, has had about enough of this nonsense:
The most boring game I have ever watched if this is what we have ti look forward to dont bother watching wirld cup
GOAL! ENGLAND ARE GOING TO WIN THE WORLD CUP! TAKE THAT DENMARK! It's the boy Lallana with a great run and weave down the left, he cuts inside and stands the ball up perfectly for Sturridge who is in acres of space in the area. Sturridge has time to pick his spot with the header, it's ENGLAND 1 DENMARK 0 (Sturridge 82) For those as are interested, England won their cricket match in the West Indies at the exact second that goal went in. We're going to win the cricket World Cup too! Take that, Bangladesh et al.
79 mins: Can England paper over the cracks with a win/gain a little filip from a win? They've got a freekick 35 yards out when a Danish player nobbles Wellbeck.
77 mins: Jordan Henderson gives way to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as an email arrives from the splendid Søren H. Assmann
So, I see my Danes are holding on in merry old England. Glad to see Schmeichel play. I believe he needs just a little bit more effort, and well, the name might be an issue. It has pressed down bigger men to wear a great name on the jersey. Then again, England ain't a powerhouse like Armenia - which shamed my Danes in an 0-4 victory IN Denmark. Which cost us the qualifier.
You want an English squad? Huh. Bit tough, you know. I firmly believe you need players that want to play for England more than anything else. And that seems to be hard-pressed these days.
Goal: Joe Hart. Backups: Kelvin Davis and Tom Heaton. Seriously, why no more English goalies in the Premier League? I'd try to build up Tom Heaton as the 2nd man.
Defensive Line: Phil Jagielka, Tony Hibbert, Ashley Cole, Joleon Lescott, Micah Richards, Leighton Baines, Kyle Naughton, Chris Smalling
Midfield: James Milner, Jordan Henderson, Gareth Barry, Aaron Lennon, Michael Carrick, Jack Wilshere
Strikers: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Daniel Sturridge, Theo Walcott, Wayne Rooney - should be benched, if he doesn't perform, but I believe he still wants to play for you.
75 mins: Lallana again, doing himself no harm at all with this little cameo, he feeds Wellbeck who unleashes a thunderbolt of a shot. Hit very hard but in range of Schmeichel, who tips over. Gerrard's corner comes to little. Evan Dunn writes:
Is the meaning of a friendly to just have a bit of a silly runabout and charge the public to watch? To pay for the early plane flights home Brazil maybe?
74 mins: This Lallana seems a talent. Down the left, great pace, lashes it across. No one can get on it.
72 mins: Smalling loses it in silly fashion.
69 mins: Peter's lad is having a great game in the Denmark goal. He rushes out very bravely to deny Wellbeck as the England forward, equally bravely I might add, slides in
66 mins: Good hold up play from Wellbeck, he holds off two defenders and drills it hard at Wellbeck. More from Mike. We're like having a whole thing here. Do join in:
So Gerrard is being picked on the basis of a wonderful club career? How about your thoughts on Rooney’s fantastic international performances? Name one England player who plays better in an England shirt than a club shirt? Cleverley perhaps?
My point is that maybe we should try some new players who haven't been to an international tournament and totally sucked. Seems reasonable to me to say that Cahill, Henderson, Sterling, Sturridge, Lallana, Shaw, Welbeck et al are here becauase they've done well for their clubs, and because they might yet be able to do the same for England. The older generation of Coles, Fwanks, Stevies, Big JTs etc have been tried, and they have failed. Why not try some other bunch? I have no club-based axe to grind, by the way, if that's why you're picking a Man United player as a counter example. Liverpool and Man U are all the same to me.
63 mins: Johnson caught in possession but England get back well to help. The Danes have brought on Niki Zimling, Andreas Bjelland and Steffen Rasmussen. Within a minute, the last-named has gone in the book, and then seized upon a village bit of defending from England, the ball pinging off helpless centre backs and red-faced shouty midfielders, to surge through. Good save from Joe Hart. Sorry to say it, but that was the second best chance of the game, the best remains Denmark's 38 minute effort from His Name Is Robert Poulsen.
61 mins: We're into that phase of the friendly where they bring on a sub every two minutes. Mike writes:
It doesn’t really matter what position Rooney has been asked to play. Shouldn’t he be able to get a shot within 10 yards of the goal for 300k a week?
59 mins: Rooney's run his race, he comes off and Danny Wellbeck comes on. Ooh, Lallana! Twisting and turning like a twisty turny thing down the left, fires a low cross across. Dangerous.
58 mins: Adam Lallana comes on, Jack Wilshere comes off. England hump the first freekick into the wall, but Gerrard now gets a go at it as well. Screws the shot wide, but not by a million miles.
56 mins: Sturridge and Wilshere with neat bits of skill, flicks on, and they release Rooney, who is galloping into the area. Dan Agger nobbles him.
54 mins: Good link up from Sterling, who has been at the hear of everything good. He frees the energetic Shaw.
51 mins: You can hear a pin drop at Wembley. I'm not sure what position Wayne has been told to play. Mike Turney writes:
Message received and understood- you don’t like Gerrard.
Not at all. Don't have any strong feelings about him either way, sure he is a perfectly nice chap. Just feel that he is a tried and failed performer for England who continues to be selected on the basis of his reputation and wonderful club career; and that perhaps it's time to move on. You literally cannot argue with his record as an England international.
49 mins: Denmark flap about at the back and fail to clear, it nearly drops for Henderson. Rooney comes back to centre mid to spray it out to Johnson. Good move, but he just over-runs it.
47 mins: England recover from that little shock, and are now passing it about in the safety of their own third.
46 mins: Juelsgard, a young left back playing in his second international, makes a splendid start, motoring down the left and lashing a cross in. Cahill earns his money with a sharp reaction and clearance.
21.00 Looks like Luke Shaw is on for Ashley Cole. Shaw becomes the fourth Southampton player to make a debut this season. For Denmark, Kasper Kusk and Jesper Juelsgard come on
<noframe>Twitter: Henry Winter - Laboured half from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23eng" target="_blank">#eng</a>. But Sterling good (quick, strong, doesn't get knocked off ball, technical, passing). Cole good too</noframe>
HT: ENGLAND 0 DENMARK 0 Yeah, so the usual mixture of the okay-ish and the slightly frustrating. Glenn Hoddle says that there is a shape to England's play and that the front three have been changing positions well. But there's not the support arriving from midfield in the shape of Wilshere and Henderson. [Steven Gerrard of course is exempt from any criticism by the TV pundits]. Ian Wright is worried about Rooney's position - why isn't he getting in the box? Lee Dixon thinks that Sturridge is not well suited by his role, seems to be ending up in a fullback's posish.

Let's get a few of your emails. Here's Darren Madden:
Looks like I'll be watching Mike Bassett England manager before the tournament. The film is the England team to a T for the last 30 years. Where's our Ronaldo, Ineista or Messi? Over hyped as always.
And here is Al Waters on his settee in Leicester.
Looking up from work to watch football. Thought it was 66 world cup. Red v white shirts and orange ball at wembly. However not as exciting.
45+ mins: That's the last meaningful action of the half.
<noframe>Twitter: Henry Winter - Can somebody get a petition up to have Sturridge playing more central, not wide for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23eng" target="_blank">#eng</a>. Thank you.</noframe>
45 mins: Close again from England! Nodded into the box, a Danish back is not in the wide awake club, he's playing Sturridge onside. Daniel nips in, shoots, and that needs an excellent block from Schmeichel.
44 mins: Good play from Sterling and Wilshere, the ball's stood up in the area and Keeper Kasper does very well to claw that away.
42 mins: Rooney looks up, slips it to Sturridge, and here's Cole on the overlap. A hard low cross comes in! Sterling! He's hit the post. How's he managed to miss that?! On further viewing, it was a bundle in the goalmouth and it was Ankersen who slid it against the post, Raheem never got a touch.
41 mins: Denmark aren't brilliant, but they're neat enough and are making England look nervy.
40 mins: Not sure about Smalling and Cahill as a pair. Andy Townsend say that both of them need "a more dominating player alongside them" to do their best. Terry or Vidic, are the examples he gives. Denmark try a corner from the training ground. Never really looks that dangerous.
39 mins: Rooney with another shot. This one only 20 yards over. He's gradually finding his range.
38 mins: Best chance of the night, but it's fallen to Denmark. Suddenly they've opened England up, here's Poulsen baring down on Hart, and this should have been a goal had the Dane not dithered on the ball.
37 mins: Gerrard and Rooney, veterans of a hundred nights of mediocrity, link up for Rooney to shoot 25 yards over the goal.
34 mins: A muted atmosphere at Wembley. Several England players are doing okay, but as yet no more than one player is being competent at any one time.
32 mins: England pa sss th e ball slowlllllll y and without any snap or rhythm. Sturridge crackles into life, he's been switched to the right, beats his man and lashes the ball across the goal. Either Rooney or Wilshere might have go the crucial touch there.
31 mins: Alarming moment for England when the ball is pumped forward and Joe Hart is very nearly beaten to it by Lord Bendtner.
30 mins: Gerrard drills it in, cleared easily enough. Denmark might have broken but here's Sterling tracking back well.
29 mins: England win a free down the left.
26 mins: England with plenty of the ball. Not so much with the idea of what to do with it in the middle of the park, but the Johnson-Sterling situation down the right is giving cause for optimism. Not too sure who's playing left wing. Downing? Andy Hinchcliffe? I am sure Sturridge was in the side. Anyhow, here's Sterling, apparently having switched wings, with a good run and cross down the left.
<noframe>Twitter: John Brewin - Sloth lives up to his name in being outpaced by Gerrard.</noframe>
24 mins: England enjoying a good spell, but now here's Denmark with their best move of the match. Ankersen and Krohn-Delhi open England up down the left, and it's lucky that Cahill's there to scramble a low cross away.
22 mins: Nice control from Johnson as he bursts onto the ball. Agger well back to clear. Nervy times for the Danes. Gerrard with the corner, Cahill controls and volleys but, oh, he used his hand. Writes Michael Hutson:
Apologies for the directness (none needed, feel free - AT) - I'm in Chicago so am in a work-mindset. Thanks for your thoughts - always interesting to know.
My selection would be:
GK - Butland Forster Hart
RB - Johnson Walker
LB - Baines Shaw
CB - Cahill Jagielka Jones Dawson
Midfielders and Strikers - Gerrard Henderson Lampard Wilshere Lallana Lennon Sterling Sturridge Townsend Welbeck Zaha Rooney Welbeck
Two thoughts on the World Cup squad. 1. We've got a wealth of wide players in LB, RB, midfield, and attack; so I would hope we take a squad that takes advantage of that. 2. We should get the balance right between youth and experience - we've seen what the likes of Townsend will do when their given a shot, so I would hope the manager keeps going along those lines.
20 mins: Well played Wayne Rooney! Well timed run, across the front of Daniel Agger and onto a long ball. Rooney's round the keeper, who does well not to bring him down, but Rooney's momentum takes him very wide and he cannot hook it back in.
19 mins: But Rooney sends the freekick well over.
18 mins: Denmark dither totally, Steven Gerrard pinches it off Sloth perhaps 25 yards out, central. The Danish player chops him down cyncially and is rightly booked.
17 mins: Sturridge fails to control a ten-yard pass and lets it go out for a throw.
15 mins: England are playing for offside but none comes, there's a ball in from the Denmark right and England might have paid for a slightly sloppy moment had the shot not been wild.
14 mins: The game resumes. Wilshere is okay. Cole too quick for Larsen down the left. Brings him down. Decent freekick in from Stevie G. Headed out by Agger.
13 mins: Lallana is stripped and ready to go but England choose to play with ten for a bit while Jack is examined on the touchline.
10 mins: Daniel Agger loses the ball, and goes in wildly for a 50-50 with Jack Wilshere. Oh dear, Wilshere didn't enjoy that much. Delay. He's in some pain.

9 mins: Sterling slips it through to Johnson, who has overlapped well. Krohn-Delhi slide-tack;es for a corner. But now Denmark break via the majestic Nik Bendtner. The move breaks down.
8 mins: England a bit stretched down the left because Sturridge doesn't especially do the tracking back. A corner's cleared without alarm by England.
6 mins: Wilshere takes a touch, switches it to Johnson on the right. England recycle possession when ther's no immediate ball on. Now Sterling wriggles down the byline, good pace, but not the cross to match.
5 mins: Rooney with his first nag at the referee when he thinks he was fouled. Hoofed forward from the Danes but Bendtner cannot get on the end of it.
4 mins: Decent start from England, most players have had a touch of the ball, Rooney comes deep to direct operations. But now Rooney has given it away cheaply and Krohn-Delhi can break. Crowded out by England backs before he can get a decent effort away.
2 mins: Nice link-up from Sterling and Johnson down the right, they've opened Denmark up, but Sterling's effort on goal is weak and wasteful, with players waiting in the box for a cross once he got to the byline.
1 mins: Big night for Chris Smalling and Raheem Sterling. The latter gets off to a bad start when he miscontrols a simple ball from clubmate Steven Gerrard.
20.00 The Danes, via number two Sloth, will kick off.
19.59 Minute's applause in memory of Sir Tom Finney, Richard Moller Nielsen (coach of Denmark's 1992 European Championship side) and Bert Williams, the former England goalie.
19.57 Quick rundown of the teams then
England: Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Smalling, Cole, Wilshere, Henderson, Gerrard, Sterling, Rooney, Sturridge. Subs: Shaw, Ruddy, Foster, Forster, Baines, Caulker, Carrick, Milner, Lampard, Barkley, Cleverley, Lallana, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Townsend, Lambert, Defoe, Welbeck, Rodriguez.
Denmark: Schmeichel, Sloth, Agger, Kjaer, Peter Ankersen, Kvist Jorgensen, Jacobsen, Poulsen, Krohn-Delhi, Larsen,Bendtner. Subs: Andersen, Lossl, Kahlenberg, Bjelland, Kusk, Olsen, Zimling, Rasmussen, Delaney, Jacob Ankersen, Juelsgaard, Makienok Christoffersen.
Referee: Kevin Blom (Holland)
<noframe>Twitter: Samuel Luckhurst - Tom Cleverley's name booed by some England fans.</noframe>
19.54 Sub-par booing of the Danish national anthem there. These fans will have to raise their game, there's no room for complacency at this late stage.
19.52 Last time there were seven Liverpool players in an England XI? 1977.
Here's Raheem Sterling making a ball talk.

19.48 England players. Talking about their dream of getting on that plane. Pilloried by the nation for a nil-nil with Costa Rica. Humbled in the last 16 by Germany or whoever. What Englishman wouldn't want to be at the World Cup?
<noframe>Twitter: Football ClichÃ©s - Chiles and Dixon are on the plane. Last chance for Ian Wright to impress, you feel, while Hoddle's experience could be vital.</noframe>
19.46 "I don't know why people are always in Frank's lap... I mean, on his back." Ian Wright there on veteran midfielder Lampard.
19.45 Nice bit of insight from Dixon, Wright and Hoddle about what it means to get the call from a manager telling you that you're not in a squad. Dixon jokes that he'd had it from Hoddle. Ian Wright says he used to hide from Hoddle in the hotel just in case Hoddle was going to be telling him "Sorry Ian, can I have a word..."
19.40 Roy: "This is a preview of Brazil and what we need to think about in the next few months. Important friendly, our last chance to play a friendly before I select the squad. We do not judge players purely on their 45, 60, 90 minutes in a friendly. We look to their club form, etc. Do you go with experience or youth? It is not a simple question."
19.38 They're saying 65,000 might be in at Wembley. Here's Roy.
19.33 A splendidly demanding email from Michael Hutson.
Before the match starts, what is the squad you would take to the World Cup? It would be interesting to see if/how that changes in watching/commentating on this match. Also good to know your opinion from the outset - gives some account of bias for us readers :)
Excellent question, I wish I had more time to answer it fully. I like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, John Ruddy, Gary Cahill, Kyle Walker, James Milner, Raheem Sterling, Andros Townsend, Rickie Lambert, Wayne Rooney, and Daniel Sturridge.
I think the England national side's largely been made up of frauds in my lifetime, but those ones above I do like. Oh, and Frank Lampard. I strongly expect us to stink up the joint in Brazil, but I guess you never know, right?
19.32 Glenn Hoddle. Would he be starting to worry about telling players they weren't going to the World Cup? No he would not, he says.
19.31 Montage of England fans offering their opinion about the England team. Idiots, every last one of them. "Got to be Gerrard and Lampard". Sure. Why change a winning conbo, right?
19.29 Right. We're nearly ready for TV time. Hopefully that Coronation Street lady has kicked hotel cheater man to the curb. Ready now for our ridiculous and vaguely depressing soap opera of our own. Yes, it's England.
19.24 Pretty cool for Liverpool to have so many starters.
<noframe>Twitter: Paul Hayward - 5 Liverpool starters for England. Anfield was always a good provider. Keegan, Hughes, Barnes, Beardsley, Owen, McMan etc</noframe>
19.22 An email from Evan Dunn makes a good point.
The Cleverley petition, rebuffed by Hodgson, has probably actually cemented Roy's determination to include him. Ironic huh!
19.18 England team to play Denmark at Wembley: Hart, Johnson, Cole, Smalling, Cahill, Gerrard, Wilshere, Henderson, Sterling, Rooney, Sturridge.
19.16 Little bit of news wire copy, which is in a different tense to a live blog, but what is this, grammar class or something?
Ashley Cole was given a chance to prove he deserves a place on the plane to Brazil after being named in the starting XI for England's friendly against Denmark.
With Leighton Baines now confirmed as England's first-choice, Cole and teenager Luke Shaw are vying for the only other free left-back spot in the World Cup squad.
Cole has been out of the Chelsea team of late, but he was named in the starting XI for the final match before manager Roy Hodgson names his World Cup squad.
Southampton teenager Shaw was expected to replace 33-year-old Cole at half-time.
Five Liverpool players were named in the starting XI. Captain Steven Gerrard was joined in midfield by Jordan Henderson, who made his first England start since November 2010.
Raheem Sterling was rewarded for his fine club form by being handed his second cap while Glen Johnson brought up his half century at right-back.
Daniel Sturridge was the fifth Anfield man in the starting line-up, with Wayne Rooney his partner up front. Joe Hart kept his place in goal and Jack Wilshere also began the game.
With Phil Jagielka and Phil Jones out through injury, Hodgson opted to start with Chris Smalling and Gary Cahill at centre-back.
19.15 Stat attack! Peter Schmeichel played four times against England but never finished on the winning side? Can son Kasper Schmeichel right that wrong?
19.10 Anyway I think I've had enough of that. Much more pressingly, here's news of the England football team. And it comes via Henry Winter and his twitters.
<noframe>Twitter: Henry Winter - Five <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23lfc" target="_blank">#lfc</a> players start&hellip;..<a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23eng" target="_blank">#eng</a>: Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Smalling, Cole; Henderson, Gerrard, Wilshere; Sterling, Sturridge, Rooney.</noframe>
19.00 I always enjoy an ITV football. Not because of the way ITV cover the football. Obviously. I'm not an idiot. But you get to see a bit of the sorts of shows that you would never, ever watch if they weren't a lead-in to sport. Currently it's a soap opera. A man is telling a lady some lies. I can't see why she cannot tell. He is making it very obvious. He was telling her that he had to go away for the night, business trip blah blah. He's cheating on you, pretty Northern lady with too much hair. And sure enough, his phone has rung, and it's the hotel he'd booked, phoning to tell him that he's getting an upgrade on his room for the night. That again! That always happens. Hotels are ALWAYS doing that in real life: phoning up guests and telling whatever rando answers their phone about the rooms. He's so busted! She's confronted him. Ooh, you SUCK at this, hotel cheater man. How do they come up with this stuff? Now some men in hi-vis vests are talking, I think, about setting some dogs on another man. Is this how we go on? It's Coronation Street.
18.53 News from ITV about the England World Cup song. It's going to be a cover of Take That hit 'Greatest Day'. Among those responsible involved are Gary Barlow, Gary Lineker, Sir Geoff Hurst, two Spice Girls, something called a Pixie Lott, and The Artist Formerly Known As England's Michael Owen. I for one cannot wait to avoid listening to it.
18.51 Three other nations from this part of the world have got tough-looking engagements.
Poland V Scotland
R. of Ireland V Serbia
Wales V Iceland
18.50 Half-time in Cyrpus v Northern Ireland and it's 0-0. Not really sure what to say about that. Sorry, Northern Irish fans?
18.46 Having seen their cricketers beaten in a thriller earlier, it's a bad day for South African sports fans. Bafana Bafana are currently being rinsed 0-4 by Brazil.
18.39 An email arrives from Nick Martin. I've got a friend called Nick Martin. Nick Martin, are you that Nick Martin? Or, Nick Martin, are you another Nick Martin?
Whilst the cleverley petition is in poor taste, he should be nowhere near the England squad. Roy has got the chance to take some players who might develop into something special, Tom's had his chance.
18.33 Italy manager Prandelli wants to have a look at Torino forward Ciro Immobile (his movement is poor. Probably. I have no idea, to be hoenst) and Parma's Argentinian-born defender Gabriel Paletta. Mad Mario is crocked though. Talking of Italy, I really enjoyed this piece from Jim White on the delightful Andrea Pirlo.
Analysis of Pirlo’s running statistics after a game would not insist that he exerts his influence by charging around the field. At Juve, Pirlo leaves that sort of exertion to his youthful midfield partners Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba. Instead, patrolling an area not much more extensive than the centre circle, he sits in front of his back four, firing out quarterback-type passes, occasionally ambling forward to take a free-kick or corner.
In a man-of-the-match performance against Germany last November, he rarely broke into anything more strenuous than a gentle jog. And yet the athletic, powerful German midfielders could get nowhere near him. It seemed impossible that players so much quicker than him could not catch him. The opposition grew ever more frustrated at their inability to resolve the conundrum until Sami Khedira ruptured his knee ligaments, putting himself out of the World Cup, in an attempt to dispossess the Italian. As the German fell to the turf, yelling in pain, Pirlo eased away with the ball, utterly unscathed.
18.31 As for Uruguay, they have a match against Austria, who will not be in Brazil.
18.26 What other games are on tonight, then? England's group opponents UR Gay are in action in Austria, Luis Suarez starts. Italy travel to Spain for an eye-catching fixture. Costa Rica welcome Paraguay to San Jose, hopefully the Paraguayan team know the way. They lost 0-4 to Chile recently, which is not ideal but then Chile look a pretty good side to me. Costa Rica also got turned over by South Korea, though, which sounds more concerning.

<noframe>Twitter: Manchester escorts - I'm sort of looking forward to the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23England" target="_blank">#England</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Denmark" target="_blank">#Denmark</a> game tonight but I find it hard to encourage Rooney and co lol.</noframe>
18.21 And what would that do to one of the traditional excuses that our boys were all exhausted after a gruelling season with no winter break?
18.20 Steven Gerrard, it sez ere in the Evening Standard, reckons: "It is really healthy for England and our chances of doing well that we have so many players invovled in the title raceand fighting for the European places in the League." Do you agree? Or would the national side be better off with a load of players who were less knackered by an intense end to the season?
18.10 Evening all, Alan Tyers here. Welcome to our live blog coverage of the England game.
12.15 The build-up to the World Cup officially starts today and it is crunch time for a number of England hopefuls. There are sub-plots aplenty: Luke Shaw v Ashley Cole, Andros Townsend v Raheem Sterling, Frank Lampard v Michael Carrick v Jordan Henderson, Tom Cleverley v the 10,000 England supporters who have signed an online petition calling for him to be banned from England's World Cup squad.
Alan Tyers will be here from around 6pm to bring you all the pre-match build-up from Wembley so do join him then. While you wait there are plenty of links at the top of this blog to get stuck into. Why not begin with Matt Law's piece on how Liverpool can provide the backbone for England's World Cup side:
All five Liverpool players in Hodgson’s 30-man squad are likely to play against Denmark tonight and the Anfield contingent has even extended to Dr Steve Peters joining England’s World Cup backroom team as a psychiatrist.
Manchester United’s struggles have prompted a shift in the natural order of this season’s Premier League table and it appears Liverpool are ready to challenge the Old Trafford club and Chelsea as the new dominant force within the England squad.
