Pakistan left to rue dropped catches as Australia advance to Cricket World Cup semi-final

After a month on the back-burner, this World Cup is hotting up. Australia v India in Sydney on Thursday is a semi-final fit for the gods, unlike parts of England’s World Cup campaign that were fit for the dogs.
More than hotting up, the tournament threatened to boil over at one stage of Australia’s quarter-final against Pakistan, when Wahab Riaz bowled one of the fastest spells ever delivered in limited-overs cricket. With a white ball Pakistan’s fast left-armer generated white heat.

Little more than a year ago, during the last Ashes, Australia’s batsmen had been able to sit back and enjoy Mitchell Johnson launching his rockets up England. On this occasion they were on the receiving end as Riaz did a like-for-like impersonation of Johnson at his fieriest, with one difference: Riaz had no supporting cast.

Since Pakistan had the meagre total of 213 to defend, Riaz had to bowl flat out to keep his country in the World Cup, and he gave it everything – and will give a little more, no doubt, in the form of an ICC fine for going over the top when dishing out his verbals.
Sprinting in from the River Torrens end – the opposite end from which Johnson blew England apart – he bowled more like Johnson than Johnson had done earlier in the game, now the Australian is 33 and a foot or two down in pace from his peak of a year ago.

Much of this World Cup has been a festival of hitting, with totals surpassing 400 - or 200 in England’s case - but suddenly batting became impossible as Riaz hit the speeds where a batsman reacts involuntarily, not as he rehearsed.
The speedometer showed a peak of 150 kph for Riaz, but it rates short-pitched balls slower than full-pitched ones, and Riaz bowled short alright.

In his six-over spell Riaz directed his fire at David Warner, whom he immediately had caught carving to third man, Michael Clarke and Shane Watson. At the other end Steve Smith was happy to watch, and nimble enough to scamper a couple of singles to get off strike.
Clarke was bounced out like an England tailender of a year ago (no names). "That's as good as I've faced in one-day cricket for a long time," Clarke said afterwards.
Disconcerted by the angle which is so rare – Wasim Akram was the first outright fast left-armer, and only in the last half-a-dozen years have others followed suit, like Johnson, Riaz and Mitchell Starc – Clarke was caught chest-on and spooned a catch to a very short midwicket.
Watson, tall and rather inflexible, copped a serious barrage. Once an over for the rest of Riaz’s spell he was hit on the gloves, and when he hooked, he top-edged to fine-leg – only Rahat Ali could not put his hands together. Here was Pakistani cricket in little more than a second: the extremes of brilliance and incompetence.

Riaz reacted with a scream of anguish – Watson had scored no more than four, and Australia would have been 83 for four - then with ever more histrionics. He ran down the pitch to stare at Watson, then to blow him a kiss: nothing too bad in this spell. But when he came back for his second, he over-stepped the mark by following through at the end of an over to abuse Watson face to face.
Mind you, Riaz had just seen another catch dropped, when Glenn Maxwell tried to pull out of a pull and skied to third man. This time Sohail Khan was the fielder who let him down. Pakistan’s last chance: Australia would have been 154 for five.
Thereafter Watson and Maxwell took Australia into their semi-final with some strokes of astonishing brilliance. One partnership was sufficient to win this game, after Pakistan’s batsmen had all got out to catches through poor selection or execution of shot.
It was the last scheduled one-day international for the imperturbable Misbah ul-Haq, whose captaincy has kept Pakistan together in their years of exile, and his temperamental opposite, the impetuous Shahid Afridi. But Pakistan went out of this World Cup with a bang, and a roar, not a whimper – like some.
