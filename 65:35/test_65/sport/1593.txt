How to Turn Competition Into Collaboration
College football season is almost over... hard to believe huh?! How'd your team do? The Wolverines had a pretty terrible year... but now we've got coach Harbaugh so GO BLUE! All you Buckeye fans, I'm sorry, I had to say it... For the past 8 years whenever I'm in Ohio I always hear, "You went to Michigan?! Ugh that's awful!" Or I'd be in Michigan and hear, "You're from Columbus Ohio?! I hate that place!" You see, I grew up in Buckeye land but became a Wolverine, which means I get crapped on from both sides. If I'm in Ohio everyone hates my Michigan gear, if I'm in Michigan I can never mention I'm from Ohio. Not the best! Why is any of this relevant? Well, it got me thinking about the word "competition" and how it plays out in our lives. Is it possible to be competitive and collaborative? Could Brutus ever snuggle up to a Wolverine? What if we could all compete as one? That would be pretty cool huh?! Yeah it would! And I'll show you how in this first episode of Kip TV (ahhh the first episode... sorry I got excited)! Check it out below, you'll never think about competition in the same way...
Competition has been woven into the fabric of our existence. Ed Macauley once said, "When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win." True! And so often we're taught that competiveness=strength. That we should only be looking out for own interests. That it's a win lose game and there's only one winner.
Hmmm... The problem is that's its not just friendly rivalries where we get competitive (nothing friendly about game day). Sometimes we end up pushing away the people who could be our biggest allies by trying to beat them. We create a space of separation instead of collaboration. If there is one thing I've learned it's this... we MUST rely on each other to change our lives and the lives of people around us instead of pushing them away with our competitive nature. Now don't get me wrong, competition can serve you. So where does that leave us? I want to reframe the word "competition." Think of it like this... You are your only competition. That's it, simple. The only one you're trying to make better is you, the only one you're trying to beat is you. You can't move forward by looking sideways. Take a look at the things that have been beating you up in the "locker room" and see how you can take them out. So here's my challenge for that competitor inside: 1. What three things are beating you up? 2. How can you train it out of you? Remember, you are your only competition. It's time to face that competitor and collaborate with other people to help you out! Sound good? Write your response in the comments below because I'd love to hear from you. And here's an extra challenge: if you're a Michigan fan share this with an OSU fan, if you're a OSU fan share this with a Michigan fan... let's see how that goes!
