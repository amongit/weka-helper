London Marathon: fresh cheating claims against 'miracle' runner

A London marathon runner who insisted “I’m no cheat” after securing a faster time than Mo Farah in the second half has been branded a liar by another participant who claims she saw him squeeze through the barriers to cut his race short by nine miles.
Heather Greig, who completed her first London marathon in six hours and five minutes on April 13, said she found herself running alongside Jason Scotland-Williams near the half-way mark after crossing Tower Bridge.
She claims he then peeled off and squeezed through the barriers to join the runners going the other way, who had already rounded the Isle of Dogs and were heading for the finish line, cutting out about nine miles.
The mother-of-two, from Fife, Scotland, who was running to raise money for Asthma UK, said she assumed he would be exposed as a cheat by his timing chip so was outraged when she spotted him in the Sunday Telegraph falsely claiming to have run a fair race.
She said: “I was on course for my target time of about four-and-a-half to five hours at that point.

“After I crossed Tower Bridge and turned right there was a guy on my left shoulder, we were both quite close to the centre of the road, then somewhere near the Texaco petrol station he squashed through the barrier and headed off in the other direction.
“There was another lady beside me who saw him and I turned to her and said, ‘Oh well, he will know in his own heart he didn’t do it.’
“I assumed his chip would show that he had skipped out a lot of the race.
“I didn’t think any more of it until I saw him in the paper saying he had run a fair race and I thought, ‘You bloody cheat’.
“To stand there and say, ‘I trained incredibly hard and got that time’ shows a lack of respect for all the other runners who trained hard and completed the race and stuck with their true time.”
Mr Scotland-Williams was forced to deny he had cheated after other runners questioned why he had recorded a normal first half time of two hours seven minutes then completed the second half in a ‘miraculous’ one hour one minute, which is faster than Mo Farah and only three minutes slower than the half marathon world record.
He clocked an impressive finishing time of 3:08:47, coming 2,162nd place among the elite club runners from all over the world.
This was more than twice as fast as his time of seven hours and 24 minutes for last year when he came 34,110th.
Official statistics for the 2014 race place him in the top six per cent of runners but he has been widely accused of cheating on online running forums by jumping over the barrier which separates the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point on The Highway after runners double back on themselves having circuited Canary Wharf.
But he hit back at critics last weekend insisting: “I have done nothing wrong.”
Speaking at his west London home, the part-time model said: “I’m a personal trainer. I train every day, seven days a week, for the past seven years. Nobody thinks maybe I just trained hard. No one thinks 'maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go’.”
He added: “All along the route are stewards and people watching. There’s no way you can cheat.”
When confronted over Mrs Greig’s allegations Mr Scotland-Williams refused to comment further.
He said: “I have nothing more to say, I wish to be left alone.
“Two weeks ago I was a nobody. As far as I'm concerned I'm still a nobody. I don't want to comment on anything more."
The official marathon website records Scotland-Williams time for each 5km until he reached the halfway point at 2:07:05.
But organisers were only able to give estimates for his times at 25km, 30km and 35km before he clocked in on 2:49:46 at 40km and 3:08:47 at the finish line.
In one post on a blog that drew attention to Mr Scotland-Williams’s times, Darryl Morris wrote: “I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it.”
He added: “Just noted the barrier skip… that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!”
Another comment read: “He must have jumped over the barrier where the course doubles back, only explanation.”
Mr Scotland-Williams was competing in last weekend’s race to raise money for Sense, a charity for deaf and blind people.
He was pictured during the race wearing a Sense bib and a mask from the V for Vendetta film.
London Marathon organisers confirmed they are investigating a number of runners’ times and discrepancies.
Hugh Brasher, race director, said: “We have a number of anti-cheating measures but there are a few people, a very few people, who unfortunately do take short cuts in the marathon.
“We have an investigation process which takes two to three weeks to complete and when that is finished any people who are believed to have falsified their times will be disqualified from this race and all future London marathons.
“It is only a very few people who do cheat and we do not want this to take away from the many thousands who run a fair race.”
