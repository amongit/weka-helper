Little in sport has prompted more political outrage than Fifa’s decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, the date of which was finally confirmed on Thursday, more than four years on.
The switch to November-December has caused massive disruption but Blatter sidestepped questions about whether he should apologise on behalf of Fifa, despite previously insisting the tournament would played in the summer, until eventually saying: "If you want that I apologise to you, I say sorry."
The move arguably contributed to Fifa having to pay the European Club Association $209 million (£140 million) for the release of players at both of the next two World Cups, a threefold increase on last year’s event in Brazil. But that and any potential loss of revenue from broadcasters paled in comparison to the 50 per cent surge in revenue it enjoyed last year, from $1.4 billion (£928 million) to $2.1 billion (£1.4 billion).
