Cycling doping report: 10 things we learnt

Doping has moved 'underground' but the culture remains
While the systematic doping programmes of the likes of US Postal are a thing of the past, the CIRC report claims that the increased surveillance has simply made the dopers more "sophisticated". It questions whether the "culture of doping" — pushing everything to the limit, from TUEs to as-yet-unbanned drugs — has in fact changed at all.
The riders to testify were mainly those with an axe to grind
Of the 16 riders who permitted their names to be included in the report, only Chris Froome is an active professional. Some would argue it was in the interests of those who testified to make out like everyone is still doing it.
Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid were very naughty boys
Armstrong ban backed as former UCI presidents accused
Cycling report: Doping remains widespread
Report does not show the true state of cycling
McQuaid defends presidency ahead of doping report
The CIRC report stopped short of accusing the two former UCI presidents of outright corruption but made clear that it thought their administrations had badly damaged cycling's image by indulging Lance Armstrong, breaking rules, bullying truth seekers, allowing doping to go unpunished and waging running wars with the likes of WADA.
McQuaid's 'timing' is impeccable
McQuaid was given the benefit of the doubt with regard to Armstrong's fast-tracked comeback at the Tour Down Under in 2009, which was followed'coincidentally' by the American's decision to race at that year's Tour of Ireland, an event run by McQuaid's brother Darach.
"Whilst there is no direct evidence of an agreement between Lance Armstrong and Pat McQuaid, documents in the CIRC's possession show a temporal link between the two decisions," the report notes.
TUEs are a major problem area
Cycling has to get on top of the problem of riders exploiting Therapeutic Use Exemptions. One rider told the commission he thought "90% of TUEs were used for performance-enhancing purposes."
What have riders got to hide?
Worryingly, 95 per cent of riders will not tick the box on test forms saying they allow their samples to be used anonymously for research purposes into developing new methods of drug detection. Something to hide? Or a complete lack of trust in the testers?
Doping in amateur cycling 'endemic'
One of the saddest passages in the report relates to cycling at a youth, senior and amateur level, with the last of those said to be developing an "endemic" doping culture.
Bio passport is not proof and procedures far too lengthy
The Biological Passport is praised in the report as a game-changer but the length of time it can take to prosecute is an issue, and the passport can be manipulated by micro-dosing. Needs addressing.
Night time testing needs addressing
One of the ways of manipulating the bio passport, so the report says, is to micro-dose at night when the testers cannot test, safe in the knowledge that blood levels will be back to normal.
Armstrong's lifetime ban remains controversial
The report appears to contradict itself on the subject of Armstrong's ban, initially saying that the need to incentivise whistle blowing and offer plea bargains trumped "the principle of equal treatment of athletes". It later recommended equality at all times when sanctioning riders as "disparity undermines athletes' confidence in the disciplinary system." One for USADA.
