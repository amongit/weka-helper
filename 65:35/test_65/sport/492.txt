Around the world, an estimated one billion people watched last year's Super Bowl, according to the National Football League (NFL).
Research suggests that up to half of viewers in the US tune-in specifically for the adverts, which are the most expensive in global television.
A 30 second slot during the event sells for around $4 million (£2.7m).
The average price of Super Bowl ads have risen more than 50 per cent in the last 10 years, defying economic downturns and secular industry issues.
The game could easily generate over a quarter of a billion dollars in ad sales.
