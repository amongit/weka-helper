You don't have to be a scientist to enjoy watching football, but being one certainly changes your perspective on the game.
Just ask Dr. Ainissa Ramirez, co-author of the 2013 book Newton's Football: The Science Behind America's Game.
As the materials-scientist-turned-science-evangelist makes clear in this wide-ranging interview with HuffPost Science editor David Freeman, football spotlights a series of fascinating science-themed questions--from why the ball is shaped like that (an "prolate spheroid") to why helmets don't offer much protection against concussions, to the daunting physics of on-field collisions.
