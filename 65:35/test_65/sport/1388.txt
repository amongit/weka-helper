Premier League predictions: Lawro v Jeremy Vine & the Eggheads
22 March 2015 Last updated at 19:38
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.
Lawro's opponents for this weekend's Premier League fixtures are the Eggheads - host Jeremy Vine and general knowledge experts Kevin and Dave from the daily BBC Two quiz show.
Vine is a Chelsea fan who chose the Blues when he decided to support a football club in the mid 1990s because he was "ashamed" he knew nothing about the game.
He told BBC Sport: "I know people are very down on this but I looked at the travel connections from where I lived in Maida Vale at the time and thought Chelsea was convenient on the tube.
"I was hooked from my first game. Now I have two season tickets and go with my daughter, who is 10 and has been coming for the last two years.
"Her name is Martha and the most exciting thing in my life right now is that she has suddenly decided that Chelsea matters, and it matters more than almost anything."

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.
Last weekend, Lawro got seven correct results from 10 Premier League games, with no perfect scores.
His score of seven points was beaten by TV and radio presenter Dermot O'Leary, who picked six correct results, but with one perfect score. That gave O'Leary, who raised Â£643,336 for Comic Relief with his '24-hour non-stop day of dance' last week, a total of eight points.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
