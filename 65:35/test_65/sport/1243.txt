Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, has accepted Steven Gerrard’s apology after his “frustrated” captain took full responsibility for their damaging defeat to Manchester United.
Gerrard was sent off just 38 seconds after he had come on as substitute for a nasty stamp on Ander Herrera. The apology came just minutes after a defeat that extended United’s lead over their rivals in the pursuit of a Champions League place to five points.

Rodgers knows better than to publicly criticise the club’s iconic midfielder and even offered the former England international a get out, suggesting he had only lost control of his temper because he had been forced to watch such a timid Liverpool performance in the first half from the substitute’s bench.
Gerrard, though, knows he only has himself to blame and claimed his stupidity had prevented Liverpool from taking at least a point.

Although Liverpool were forced to play the rest of the second-half with 10 men, and fell two goals behind when Juan Mata finished superbly for the second time in the game, Daniel Sturridge pulled a goal back and the home side finished strongly.
“I’ve got to accept it, the decision was right” said Gerrard, who asked to be interviewed by Sky Sports. “I’ve let my team-mates, manager and more importantly the supporters down and I take full responsibility for that.
“I think I’ve tried to avoid his tackle and I’ve reacted when I’ve seen his studs showing. But I’ve been in the game long enough to know, when you do that with 45 minutes to play and a great opportunity to get back into the game, I take full responsibility.
“I don’t know what’s caused it, I think I’ve probably reacted to the initial tackle, but I don’t want to say too much more. I wanted to apologise to the supporters and I take full responsibility for the result.”

Things could get even worse for Liverpool if the FA decide to take retrospective action against centre back Martin Skrtel after he appeared to stamp on David De Gea in stoppage time.
Rodgers said Gerrard’s willingness to apologise was a measure of the man and insisted he would not dwell on his indiscretion.

However, a three game suspension means Gerrard could only be available for six more games as a Liverpool player and his close friend Jamie Carragher suggested the sending off was due to the fact he could not handle the fact he is no longer first choice.
"I think the frustration of not playing, of being on the bench, and that tackle flying in, has made him do it,” said Carragher.
“He has always been the main man. Whenever Steven has come back from injury before, he has gone straight back into the side. I think that [starting on the bench] has played its part. It was a moment of madness.”
Gary Neville, commentating for Sky Sports, was also critical. He said: "I think he might have been stupid, Steven Gerrard - he stamps on Herrera.
"The first challenge on Mata you could say is a fair challenge but there's a stamp in the second one and the referee has spotted it.
"Gerrard will know, with the experience that he has, that it is stupidity.

"It's the emotions sometimes when you play in a fixture like this.
"He's come on with thunder in his mind: he's gone through Mata early, he's obviously tried to lift the crowd but it's got to him."
Rodgers, who said he had told his captain he would not be starting days before the game, did not betray if he agreed with that view, although he admitted Gerrard was frustrated because United dominated the first half.
“It’s big of someone when they have been sent off to apologise,” said Rodgers, who has lost twice to Louis van Gaal this season. “He was probably that frustrated watching us in the first half when we didn’t make a tackle. We will move on, I’m not going to criticise him.
“It wasn’t just that, [the sending off] we were disappointed with every area of our first half performance, particularly the failure to press them high up the pitch, when that is what the team had been set up to do. They controlled the game in the first half far too easily.
“It shows the character of these players and why we have been on the sort of run we’ve been on, that in the second half, you wouldn’t have been able to tell we were playing with ten men. We at least made a fight of it.
“We knew we’d probably lose one game between now and the end of the season, it’s shame it’s happened against our rivals, but a top four finish is still very much possible.”
Off: Steven Gerrard is shown the red card
Van Gaal was satisfied with the win and delighted with the first half performance, although he was not happy with the way his team played against 10 men.
“It was our best 45 minutes away from home this season, we were superb, scored a fantastic goal and I was full of compliments at half time” said Van Gaal. “But in the second half we were not so good.
“I don’t think this means we have ended Liverpool’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. When you have a brilliant manager, players and you are a brilliant club, which Liverpool are, you can recover from defeats.
“We have had to do it this season, we lost at home to Arsenal in the FA Cup, but we have beaten Spurs and Liverpool since then. We recovered and Liverpool can do the same.
“There are eight games remaining and 24 points still to play for. Liverpool are not out of it, although I’m very pleased to have come here and win the game. The gap between us was two points and now it is five.”
