Leon Smith targets role as Scotland coach after Davis Cup triumph against the USA

As Leon Smith's victorious Davis Cup players boarded flights for their next tournament in California, the captain himself has a different destination in mind: helping Scottish tennis take advantage of the once-in-a-lifetime champion that is Andy Murray.
The passionate support on show during the weekend's triumphant victory over the USA reveals the latent interest north of the border. The 23,000 seats at Glasgow's Emirates Arena sold out in less than 10 minutes, and yet Murray's brother Jamie has repeatedly blasted Tennis Scotland for their failure to build new courts or expand the local playing base over the past decade.
Now Smith - whose role as the Lawn Tennis Association's head of men's tennis has been quietly shelved since Bob Brett took charge of the performance department last year - believes that Scotland needs to resurrect the position of "national coach". More than that, he would prefer to fill the role himself.
Smith has made his feelings known to David Marshall, Tennis Scotland's chief executive, but the final decision may come down to the LTA's chief executive Michael Downey.
In any internal debate, Smith can expect strong support from the Murray family - who are, after all, the greatest asset British tennis has ever had. Last week, Jamie Murray stepped up his campaign against Marshall and company by saying "I think the LTA neglects Scotland...But, in saying that, if I was in charge of dishing out the money, I wouldn't give a hell of a lot of money to Tennis Scotland with the people that are there."

Bizarrely, the job of Scotland's national tennis coach hasn't even existed since Judy Murray held it between 1995 to 2004. It is particularly hard to understand why it was abolished when you look at her legacy: apart from her own sons, she also helped to guide two other Davis Cup players in Jamie Baker and Colin Fleming, as well as the late Elena Baltacha, who was Britain's top player for much of her career.
Smith's star began to rise when Judy Murray took him on as her assistant in 1997, aged 21, with particular responsibility for looking after Andy's development. He didn't drop the ball then, and he certainly hasn't since becoming a left-field choice as Davis Cup captain in April 2010.
That decision was welcomed with cynicism, and yet Smith has delivered an extraordinary record: nine wins from 11 matches, carrying Great Britain from the brink of relegation into Europe/Africa Zone Group III to successive World Group quarter-finals.
In between Davis Cup ties, Smith has recently found himself shuttling between the LTA's high-performance centres at Stirling and Nottingham. Given that both these centres already have a coaching team, it seems an ineffectual way of using his gifts, and surely a role in Scotland would make perfect sense. The national coach would not just be involved in guiding the best talents, but in trying to drive better facilities and higher participation - two areas where there is plenty of room for improvement.
