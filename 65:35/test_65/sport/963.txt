UFC 183: Anderson Silva had psychologist sessions and compares himself to Pele and Michael Jordan

Legendary former UFC world middleweight champion Anderson 'The Spider' Silva returns to the Octagon this Saturday night in Las Vegas against Nick Diaz in a five-round bout chock-full of questions and ifs, buts and maybes.
Silva, regarded as one of the greatest ever in the sport, and certainly one of the most remarkable and spectacular finishers of all time, spoke to me as he made his recovery from that horrific leg injury.

Much of the mystery surrounds Silva, of course, who 13 months ago broke his leg in an ill-fated UFC title shot against Chris Weidman in Las Vegas. The break was horrible. It sent shock waves around the world and appeared to end the Brazilian's career.
But now he's back. Now he's gearing up to kick Diaz as if no great drama ever unfolded in 2013.

"Even though I had to go through some bad times and lost the title, I was able to find things that are more important to my personal life to be able to keep moving forward. I'm more centred now," he explained.
But a better fighter? "A better fighter, I don't know, but definitely more experienced.
"When my leg was broken, I was in a lot of pain. A lot of things were going through my mind. But, in relation to the loss, not at all. It's a part of it. It's not the first time I've lost. It was more because of the pain and not knowing what was going to happen to me," Silva told me for the cover story of Fighters Only Magazine.
"It was fundamental for me to learn more about my body and to heal quicker.
"I had two sessions in LA with the sports psychologist. But after I had to go back to Brazil to go back to training, I haven't gone anymore. I'm going to get back to it when I'm back in Brazil."
"It was more about my patience and to understand the reason why it was happening to me in that moment. I think everything that happened had to happen. He's a champion, he has to be respected and I have to continue doing my work. I was talking last night about that.
"I was thinking about when I first started in the UFC – it's a long time. I think I started in 2005 and from 2015 to 2013, when we lost the title, I fought without losing once. So, professionally, I'm happy with what I've been able to do. And everything I did was with love and without any pressure. I was never thinking about the title or anything like that.
"Everything has its time and its moment. If it happens to be again, then great. If it doesn't, it's fine as well. I was able to get feats that few people will be able to do. Sometimes people might think I'm pretentious, but I can say that there's Michael Jordan, Pele, Kobe Bryant and Anderson Silva. There's only one.
"I'm very proud of what I achieved because I did it with love and pride. There's no doubt about anything I did in there, even in my losses."
Injury aside, Silva is now 39 years of age. He's long in the tooth and has lost his last two fights, albeit to Weidman, the best middleweight in the world. Silva's last win, a dazzling destruction of Stephan Bonnar, happened all the way back in October 2012.
All the signs, then, point to a great champion on the downward slope of a marvellous career, a career that saw him successfully defend the UFC world middleweight title 10 times and go unbeaten in 16 UFC fights.
Of course, if Silva truly is on the way out, it will be a sad day for the sport of mixed martial arts; no fighter has carried the same mystique and grace, nor the incredible ability to make top contenders look like rank amateurs.
Then again, Diaz, 31, isn't exactly carrying a whole heap of momentum in to Saturday's fight. He too has suffered back-to-back defeats – to Georges St-Pierre and Carlos Condit – and has been the victim of inactivity and contractual wrangles. His last fight was in March 2013.
Recent interviews suggest his passion and hunger for the sport may be waning.
For a fight like this, though, more exhibition than crunch title decider, Silva and Diaz appear made for each other. They are both tortured souls – for entirely different reasons – and they are both hugely popular in the hearts of the mixed martial arts faithful.
Better still, even though past their respective primes, they are still two of the most entertaining and watchable fighters in the sport. They stand, they fight, they look for the finish. And, for that reason, Saturday is a can't-miss spectacle.
It also might mark the last time we see Silva inside the Octagon. Scaremongering? Perhaps. But if we've learnt anything from Silva's career in recent times it's that he's very much human and that we should always expect the unexpected.
