10 things no one tells you before you take up weightlifting

1. There is no secret
Everyone thinks there’s some kind of magic answer to weightlifting. In reality it’s a perfect example of something you need to train hard in. Loads of work, loads of volume, go home tired, get some sleep and get back in the gym the next day. It’s easy to gauge if you’re doing well – you just put one more kilo on the bar and know you’re getting better.
2. You feel like an old man most of time
Things are going to be sore. If you’re going to lift really heavy weights above your head every day, you can expect your knees, wrists, and shoulders to hurt. Real injuries – the kind that need operations to fix – aren’t that common in weightlifting, but if you want to get good it’s going to hurt. Every morning when I wake up I feel like a right old man.
3. Coming back from injury can be boring
I hurt my back in 2010 and it was eight months before I could lift. I wasn’t sure if I’d ever be able to do it again. Time is the only answer – and strengthening your back and abs. I was doing three hours of back and ab work every day for two or three months before I could even pick up a bar without it hurting. Which is as boring as you can possibly get.

4. You can’t let nerves spoil your appetite
In my first competition back after injury I was useless. My lifts were well down, just because of nerves. I’d had my weigh-in and was supposed to eat after that, but I couldn’t eat because I felt sick. I couldn’t get any food in me at all. By the time I got to the competition I just had no energy to lift at all. You need to be able to eat after the weigh-ins, otherwise you’re in trouble.
5. You get hardly any notice for the Olympics
It’s pretty special when you get the letter from the British Olympic Association saying you’ve been selected. That was probably in June and I competed on 1st August. When I got the letter, I thought, “Right, I’ve got to get to the gym and get some training done. Eight weeks to go!”
6. It’s quite a tactical competition
There are various little rules about timing in competitions. You should have a certain number of minutes for your lift, but there are certain reasons why that can change. The other coaches can use that to their advantage and try to mess around with your warm-up, so you think you’ve got five minutes but all of a sudden you’re on the platform half warmed-up. Or they might move the weights up a bit to intimidate the other lifters, see if they’ll follow it and go up too high. It’s non-stop. Until you see it, you don’t quite realise what goes on.

7. Don’t try and lift heavy weights
People start lifting, learn a bit of technique, and think they need to lift heavy all the time to get good. In reality, heavy lifts are about one per cent of your training. They come right before a competition, but before you can get there you’ve got to spend months doing resistance work, squats, pulls, working in the 80 per cent range. It’s all about getting your reps done. Don’t rush to put too much weight on the bar or you’ll end up lifting less. Be patient with it, get the work done.
8. It’s probably the least varied training in sport
I do six to eight exercises over the course of a week and that’s it. They’re all in the gym. There’s the snatch, clean and jerk, squats, and a couple of pulling exercises. I’ll do those exercises again and again for 25 hours a week. If you want to get to that level, you’ve got to be willing to do the same things over and over. We’ll probably only have one spot for Great Britain in the Rio Olympics, so if I’m not training, one of the other weightlifters will be, so I’ve got to do it.
9. You have to eat porridge every day
I don’t mind doing the same exercises all the time, but eating the same breakfast every day is boring. But you make do. It’s a high-fat, fairly low-carb diet – lots of eggs, bacon, meat, fish, and milk. Anything that’s high in fat and high in protein.
10. In terms of injury rates, it’s one of the safest sports
But you need a real coach. Not necessarily every day, you need someone to teach you lifting in the first place. For bodybuilding, you can sit on a machine and there’s no wrong way to do it because the machine moves in the right direction for you. With weightlifting you’ve got to control that bar and know how to do it. It’s important to have a coach who knows what they’re doing. If you do, you’re not going to get hurt.
