A casting director would find plenty of material here for the next Hollywood fairytale. South of the river is the domain of the pixies - six-stone gymnasts like Tuesday’s balance beam champion Deng Linlin of China.
On the north side live the Shreks - the hulking behemoths who could pick up that balance beam one-handed and toss it into the crowd. The weightlifting event reached its climax on Tuesday, with the contest to be crowned the world’s strongest man.
This was the final of the superheavyweight event, the men who exceed the highest category of 105 kilos (which is around 16st 7lb). And they don’t exceed it by a pound or two. They go right over the top, with the heaviest man of all - Behdad Salimikordasiabi of Iran - coming in at 26st 7lbs. Can he really be a member of the same species as Linlin or our own “Twiglet”, Rebecca Tunney?
We are used to seeing events from the “world’s strongest man” tour on Saturday afternoon TV - bizarre multi-disciplinary events in which the contestants lug boulders around and pull trucks with their teeth. The sort of thing you watch with a hangover, or if it is sheeting down outside.
Terry Hollands, who usually qualifies as “Britain’s strongest man” trains for speed and aerobic endurance as well as power, because he has to perform short sharp dashes carrying sacks of coal.

But Olympic weightlifting is the real stuff. There is no complication about the snatch, no subtlety to the clean and jerk. It is raw power, honed over years and years of gradual physical expansion.
You don’t just grow up to weigh as much as a Smart Car by accident - it has to be arranged with bucketloads of protein and a terrifying training regime.
Salimikordasiabi, the dominant weightlifter of the moment, has hoisted a personal best of 250 kilos in the clean and jerk. If you could persuade all five members of China’s women’s gymnastics team to balance on the bar, he could still lift it.
These guys have jutting chests and ample bellies that quiver like piano-strings when they hold their Herculean poses. Most of them are between 6ft 2in and 6ft 4in tall, though you wonder how much those dumbbells have compacted them down, lift by agonising lift.
They have spent their lives being compressed by forces that only an astronaut could possibly comprehend.
Some fat is actually required in this discipline, because the extra ballast stabilises the lifters as they try to prevent the bar from wobbling too far backwards or forwards at the moment of truth.
But you wouldn’t want to tell someone like Carl Henriquez, from the Caribbean island of Aruba, that he is looking a bit tubby.
There was a fine geographical spread in yesterday’s “B” final, which featured Henriquez alongside other contestants from Nauru, Guatemala and Chinese Taipeii. It was finally won by Yauheni Zharnasek of Belarus with a combined total of 426 kilos (196 in the snatch, and 230 in the clean and jerk).
The spectacle of the event does not perhaps match that of the 100-metre final, but it has a grandeur of its own, and the 6,000-strong crowd was noisily committed.
It was a shame, given the vibrant atmosphere, that Team GB had not entered a superheavyweight. Admittedly, there is no one in the country who could compete at this level. But discus thrower Carl Myerscough has the right figure for it if he should ever consider a switch of discipline.
“At most weightlifting events there are about 20 people,” said Damon Kelly, the Australian who finished eighth in the “B” final. “This was the biggest crowd that I’ve ever lifted in front of, and definitely the loudest. When some of the lifters were down, and had missed a couple of attempts, the crowd helped them to lift those extra few kilos for sure.
“It almost feels like a theatre setting,” added Kelly, whose bald head and bushy black beard made him look even more intimidating than most of these human wardrobes. Yet he turned out to be the gentlest and most genial of characters once he had nipped through to the mixed zone and pulled on an incongruous pair of spectacles.
“The room’s dark and the platform’s lit. My build-up was disrupted by a couple of injuries but that was the second-biggest clean and jerk I’ve done this year. It felt like a personal best, with the support I was getting.”
It is a brutal event, and no one showed this more clearly than the defending Olympic champion Matthias Steiner. Attempting to snatch 197 kilos at the start of the “A” final, Steiner lost his balance and toppled over into such an awkward position that the bar landed on the back of his neck.
After a moment’s delay, in which the paramedics were called, Steiner got up and walked away as if nothing had happened.
Large or small, these Olympians are made of strong stuff.
