Braehmer beats Krasniqi to keep WBA light heavyweight belt
ROSTOCK, Germany (AP) -- Juergen Braehmer of Germany defeated compatriot Robin Krasniqi by technical knockout to retain his WBA light heavyweight belt on Saturday.
Krasniqi's corner pulled the challenger out ahead of the 10th round with a deep cut above his lip, sustained after he took a battering in the previous round.
A left-right combination from Braehmer sent the Kosovo-born German flying back against the ropes. Somehow Krasniqi survived the count and saw out the round, but his coach said there was no way he could continue.
''Every time I caught him with a left he was wobbling, but I didn't push it, and that's how the fight went on from round to round,'' said Braehmer, a southpaw and former WBO champion. ''I waited until the right time to deliver the right punch.''
The 36-year-old Braehmer improved to 46-2, with 34 KOs, after making the fourth defense of the title he won by beating American Marcus Oliveira in December 2013.
Krasniqi, who had made an encouraging start and forced the initiative throughout, dropped to 43-4 (16 KO).
''Congratulations to my opponent. He's really a strong man. I tried everything. I'm very disappointed,'' the Munich-based fighter said.
