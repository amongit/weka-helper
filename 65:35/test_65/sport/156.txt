Latvia: 2nd doping suspect on ice hockey team
RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvia's Olympic Committee secretary general says a second player on its national men's ice hockey team is suspected to have tested positive for a banned substance at the Sochi Winter Games.
Zorzs Tikmers wrote on Twitter: ''I can only confirm that there is another suspect test from hockey.''
On his Friday posting, Tikmers said he couldn't comment further because the case was before the International Olympic Committee disciplinary commission.
He could not be reached for further comment on Saturday.
Last month, Latvia ice hockey player Vitalijs Pavlovs was thrown out of the games after testing positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine after Latvia's loss to Canada in the quarterfinals.
