Arsène Wenger has conceded that influential forward Alexis Sánchez is suffering from fatigue and could be taken out of the firing line when his Arsenal side face Newcastle on Saturday.
Sánchez failed to show his best form in the Champions League defeat by Monaco and has looked a shadow of the player who was instrumental for Arsenal in the first half of the season following his £30 million move from Barcelona last summer.
The Chile international wasted no time settling into his new surroundings, scoring 19 goals in just 40 games, and has already become a fans favourite at Emirates Stadium.

But he has scored just once in the last 11 games, and his heavy workload seems to be getting the better of him.
With Arsenal pushing to secure a top-four finish, Wenger has been reluctant to take him out of the team — especially as the club have won 13 of their last 15 games.
But with Theo Walcott pushing hard to break back into the team, the Arsenal manager could use the opportunity to hand Sánchez a much-needed rest on Saturday to ensure he does not suffer any injury setbacks in the final stage of the season.

Wenger said: “Yes, he’s a bit [fatigued]. Also, because he is in a position where he has scored less, he wants to force his game and then he is more included in physical battles.
“Maybe his goalscoring is on his mind so he wants to do too much and he wants to force his game. I’m tempted at some stage [to give him a break]. It’s not that he won’t let me, I will decide that. It’s just that every game now is so important, you always have a hesitation to do it.”
Meanwhile, Wenger says he fully backs Football Association chairman Greg Dyke’s concerns over the “scary” increase in incidents of players surrounding referees and his call for action to be taken.
The Arsenal manager has been no stranger to controversy with officials and his team were among the highest offenders for red cards in his early years in charge.
But it is a different story now and both Wenger and his players are making sure they do not surround the referee and give him a reason to take any action.

Wenger added: “I agree completely that you want players to be ready to fight for each other. How far has that to go in the behaviour? You have to draw a line somewhere. You cannot go after every decision of the referee.
“We have less physical players and more technical players than before, that’s true. We had the old guard from England who were more educated in the English style and ready for a fight every time. The game has changed.
“You have to stop because you have to draw a line somewhere or you push the referees. How far can you go? Now I am too nice, before I was not nice enough. At the end of the day it’s down to winning the game.”
