Sam Burgess will be a hit in time, says Sonny Bill Williams

Sonny Bill Williams has backed Sam Burgess to make an impact for England at the World Cup despite his fellow rugby league recruit’s disappointing debut for the Saxons in their victory over the Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork on Friday.
Burgess struggled to make an impact on his first outing on the international stage in rugby union but Williams urged England supporters to give the Bath player time to find his feet in the 15-a-side game.
Burgess, the former South Sydney star in the National Rugby League, had been fast-tracked into the England set-up just 63 days after making his debut for Bath and is to train with the senior England squad for two days to further his experience in his new code.
Such preferential treatment has been questioned in some quarters but Williams insists Burgess will come good for England if given time.
“That is where everyone is wrong,” the New Zealander told Rugby Heaven. “They just have to be patient. Sam is a world-class athlete and I have got no doubt that whether he makes it at No 12 or No 6 he is going to make it.

“It just depends on how long it is going to take him because the ­subtleties of the two games are totally different and myself, I think he would be a perfect blindside but I think for World Cup calculations he will probably fit in better into the England squad at inside centre.
“He has got a hard work ethic and he will be hurting after performances like that if he didn’t play too well but never back against someone of his talent. It is just like Israel Folau. I am sure in his first couple of games he was getting bagged a little bit and now look at where he is.”
Meanwhile, Ireland have trimmed their squad to 38 players for the opening two rounds of the RBS Six Nations Championship, due to injuries and a number of Wolfhounds returning to their provinces.
Joe Schmidt’s side open their Six Nations defence against Italy at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday.
“Jack Conan and Michael Bent did well [on Friday night for the Wolfhounds] against the Saxons but will return to Leinster, as will Noel Reid who was restricted to a brief cameo as he was covering a number of positions,” Schmidt said. “Rob Herring returns to Ulster and will look forward to having an opportunity for further game time. Fergus McFadden has a rib cartilage injury, while Craig Gilroy will follow the return-to-play protocols after a concussion in the Wolfhounds game.”
Dave Kearney and Luke Fitzgerald are expected to be fully fit to train in preparation for the Italy game, while Eoin Reddan and Jamie Heaslip are likely to be available to train on Tuesday.
