Police are investigating a homophobic tweet sent to referee Nigel Owens after he took charge of England's 55-35 victory over Fance on Saturday.
The Welsh official was widely praised for the quality of his decision making in the thrilling final game of the tournament.
In the run-up to the game, Owens called on fans to abuse him for his performance rather than his sexuality.
•Nigel Owens: Abuse me, not my sexuality
•Brian Moore: Bad luck? England can only blame themselves
In the wake of the game, a message was sent from the account of Edryd James, @edrydjames.
The tweet said: “Your a gay ---- awful performance against france tonight, how did england top Wales?”
Owens challenged him on the tweet and he reportedly then apologised and said his phone had been stolen

@edrydJames you want me to report this homophobic tweet do you???
South Wales Police confirmed that the matter had been reported to them and they reported it to Dyfed Powys Police.

Thank you for advising @swpolice about the comments made by @edrydJames the matter is being investigated. Kind regards SWP
Many fans and players quickly leapt to Owens' defence and later on Saturday he said how much he had enjoyed the match and how much he had enjoyed "one of the best games ever".

An absolute pleasure & privilege to ref one of the best games of rugby ever . Huge credit to England & France for making it a great game
It was the first time the Welshman had taken charge at Twickenham since he received homophobic abuse from the stands during England’s 24-21 defeat to New Zealand in the autumn.
On that occasion two people were banned from Rugby HQ for two years and ordered to pay £1,000 to a charity of Owens’ choice.
A police spokesman said: "Dyfed Powys Police have launched an investigation into alleged homophobic remarks posted on Twitter which were directed towards rugby referee Nigel Owens, following his refereeing of the England v France rugby international at Twickenham on Saturday.
"This follows a number of complaints made by members of the public. The Tweet concerned has now been removed from the page. The investigation is at an early stage."
