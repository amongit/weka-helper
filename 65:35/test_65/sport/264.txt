What are you most looking forward to at the Games? What have been your highlights so far? Have you competed in sport with your partner? Any major bust-ups? Send all your thoughts and such to

Encore Here is the first of those boxing round-ups from Gareth A Davies, boxing correspondent:
Silencing the catcalls in the ring at the SECC on Monday night, Anthony Fowler's counter right hand landed on Scotsman and southpaw Kieran Smith time and again as the Englishman progressed to the quarter-finals of the middleweight division tourmament.
The home fighter tried to roughhouse the Liverpudlian in the opening round, pushing forward recklessly onto the heavy hands of the 23-year-old who reached the world championship semi-finals in Almaty, last October.
Fowler, 23, cousin of former pro footballer Robbie, who says he is arguably the poorest player ever to don boots in his family, looks the pick of the 75kg division at these Commonwealth Games.
He showed exactly why this evening. His accuracy and willingness to box, or even brawl, overwhelmed his foe.
He caught Smith with a fine combination midway through the second round, Smith having occasional successes with his left hand. Fowler landed powerfully with precise counters as the seconds counted down.
Two rounds ahead, Fowler positioned himself in the third and looked to counter precisely as Smith pushed into his range. Clear three round unanimous victory. He'll be difficult to beat as this tournament progresses.
Aged 25 when he gets to Rio, an Olympic medal could be within his reach. He merits close attention.
It's great, by the way, to see the amateurs boxing without headguards again. The expressions are there for all to see, as well as the fatigue and pain etched on their faces. The headguarded boxers were unrecognisable in recent years. Good move.
Fowler (Eng) bt Smith (Scot) 3:0
22.00 What a compelling end to an enthralling day. I'm going to wrap up this live blog now but we will have further updates from the boxing on the site tonight. Thanks for your company. Please join us tomorrow. Good night.
21.55 Terrific start from Gemili and he led after 50m but Bailey-Cole's stride took him past the Englishman to win in 10 flat. Ashmeade in lane eight almost pipped Gemili but he just held on at the line. Tremendous. BAiley Cole in 10.00, Gemili 10.10, Nickel Ashmeade in 10.12.
21.53 Bailey-Cole wins gold, Gemili silver, Ashmeade bronze.
21.51 Right, here we go. They're jumping up and down on the spot. Gemili gets a great reception.
21.49 The countdown to the men's 100m spools back through the years and shows us the past winners. David Coleman's commentary is a madeleine for me. Whoosh and I'm back. There was no one like him.
21.45 Flower of Scotland is played and sung at Hampden Park as Libby Clegg and Mikhail Huggins stand to watch the Saltire raised with gold medals around their necks.

21.40 That's a Games record for the Nigerian and the margin of victory over Veronica Campbell-Brown, who was fastest out of the blocks, was .18sec. VCB takes another silver after Manchester 2002. England's Asha Philip ran a PB 11.18 for fourth.
21.38 Okagbare wins in 10.85, VCB second, Stewart third.
21.36 Blessing Okagbare is the favourite, followed by Jamaica's VCB and Schillione Calvert and Kerron Stewart.
21.35 The women's 100m final is imminent.
21.30 Ken Patrick asks
Is Libby Clegg's guide Scottish? In general why can these T12 ladies have male guides when that that is not allowed in T12 tandem or triathlon?
Mikhail Huggins is, I'm sure English. He's a former Birchfield Harrier. I'm not sure of the answer to your second question, but I will try to find out.
21.26 Le Clos, Schooling, Barrett are 1-2-3 - South Africa, Singapore, England. LE Clos was pushed so hard he flew into the wall, bashing up his nose.
21.25 Now we have the 100m men's butterfly. Chad le Clos is the favourite. England's Adam Barrett the fastest qualifier.
21.20 The Campbell sisters Cate and Bronte in first and second with Emma McKeon also of Australia taking bronze. Fran Halsall was fourth. They were at the 50m turn in world record time. The winning margin in a Games recoerd 52.8 was only .18sec
21.19 It's the women's 100m free.
21.17 Journalists sometimes wonder why we bother to go to press conferences. Sometimes, though, you strike gold. Or in Scotland's case, oil. Jonathan Liew has hit the jackpot
My new favourite athlete. A Jamaican swimmer called Jevon Atkinson. Here's what he had to say after his morning heat.
"I looked around and thought 'Holy s---. Am I doing something wrong? Am I doing the wrong stroke?'
"I saw God at the bottom of the pool. He said: 'Swim faster'. I said 'I can't swim no faster.' He said: 'Then God will make you drown'. So I swum faster."
He came seventh.
"It feels good coming seventh," he said. "Most people would say 'F--- this s---' but I like it."
21.02 And here's Sophie Taylor with her gold medal

20.54 Men's 50m breaststroke is won by Cam Van der Burgh, Adam Peaty takes silver for England. South Africa take gold, Australia's Christian Sprenger has bronze. He won by two-hundredths of a second. That was a brilliant race.
Olly Hynd wins gold for England.

20.41 Van der Merwe wins for RSA, Du Toit second for the Saffers and Jones of Wales bronze.
20.40 They're coming very quickly now - it's the T37 para-sport 100m final now.
20.39 Audrey Lacroix wins gold for Canada, Aimee Willmott silver for England.
20.38 In the women's 200m fly Canada's Savard leads after 100m
20.35 Another field medal goes without TV coverage: Men's Shot Put Gold: O'dayne Richards (Jam) Silver: Tom Walsh (Nzl) Bronze: Tim Nedow (Can)
20.31 That was an amazing second 50m from Taylor and she wins with a national record time, 1.06.35. Another gold for Yorkshire.

20.31 But Sophie Taylor fights back to win for England, Tonks silver and Atkinson bronze.
20.30 Women's 100m breaststroke gets underway. Jamaica's Atkinson leads after 50m.
20.28 There's a bronze for England in the women's hammer: 1 Sultana Frizell (Can) 71.97m (GR), 2 Julia Ratcliffe (Nzl) 69.96, 3 Sophie Hitchon (Eng) 68.72.
20.15 Libby Clegg and Mikhail Huggins cross the line to win gold for Scotland

20.09 Jazz Carlin receives her medal. Deffrwch Cymry cysgld gwlad y gan,dwfn yw’r gwendid, ychan yw y fflam, creulon yw’r cynhaeaf

20.05 Simon McMahon writes
Agree about Michael Johnson. I could listen to him all night. In fact, forget top three, I reckon he might even be better than Townsend and Shearer.
Don't push it McMahon. Johnson will have to settle for bronze in that company.
20.00 Clegg wins by a mile! Scotland take gold in 12.20sec. Mozambique's Maria Elisa Muchavo took silver in 13.33, Lahja Ishitile of Namibia bronze.
19.58 Now we have the Para-sport 100m T11/12 final with Libby Clegg going for Scotland.
Adam Gemili wins his semi-final in 10.07sec

19.53 Over at Tollcross, England's Ollie Hynd has won gold in the men's para-sport 200m IM SM8. Silver: Jesse Aungles (Aus) Bronze: Blake Cochrane (Aus).
19.48 Kemar Bailey-Cole wins in 10.00. Jamaica first, Antoine Adamas of Saint Kitts and Nevis, second.
19.47 The third men's 100m semi-finalsts are called to their blocks.
19.45 Michael Johnson, in this author's opinion one of the top three of the world's greatest pundits, says that Adam Gemili still looks a little tight.
19.44 Jamaica's Jason Livermore qualifies in second.
19.43 That was much quicker, Adam Gemili wins in 10.07.
19.42 The men's second 100m semi-final is off.
19.41 Women's third 100m semi-final top four are: 1 Blessing Okagbare (Ngr) 10.93secs (Q) (SB), 2 Kerron Stewart (Jam) 11.20 (Q) (SB), 3 Bianca Williams (Eng) 11.34, 4 Shai-Anne Davis (Can) 11.52.
19.38 The moment Jazz Carlin turned to look at the board

19.35 The first men's 100m semi-final is won by Warren Fraser of the Bahamas in 10.21. Pedestrian to say the least. Jamaica's Ashmeade is second. Harry Akines-Areetey was fourth.
19.34 Jonathan Liew reports
That's a personal best for Jazz Carlin, and the biggest win of her career to date. She watched the 2012 Olympics on telly after suffering from glandular fever and tonsilitis, and came back in 2013 with renewed vigour and a renewed focus on the longer distance events. It's only a few years since she was refusing to swim the 800 and 1500 metres because she disliked them so much. A lot of the credit has to go to legendary coach Bud McAllister, who trained Janet Evans to gold in Seoul and Barcelona in this very event. He gave Carlin the same training sessions he gave Evans a generation ago, and such was Carlin's faith in him that when he relocated to Perth earlier this year, she followed him there. This is a huge moment for her: her first major championship medal as a solo artist. Whisper it - British swimming may just have found its new Becky Adlington.
19.29 Jazz Carlin wins Wales' first women's gold in the pool for 40 years, since Pat Beavan won the 200m breaststroke at Christchurch in 1974.
19.26 Second women's 100m semi-final first four are: 1 Veronica Campbell-Brown (Jam) 11.02secs (Q), 2 Gloria Asumnu (Ngr) 11.25 (Q) (SB), 3 Khamica Bingham (Can) 11.32 (PB), 4 Sheniqua Ferguson (Bah) 11.52.
19.25 Gold for Wales and Jazz Carlin! Boyle wins silver for NZ and Maclean takes bronze in her maple leaf hat. Hannah Miley was fifth, Camilla Hattersley was seventh.
19.25 Carlin leads at the bell for Wales. Has she gone too soon?
19.23 At 600m it's Boyle from Carlin in 0.14sec.
19.20 We're at 400m in the women's 800m free Jazz Carlin leads from NZ's Lauren Boyle by 0.3sec, Brittany Maclean of Canada third.
19.16 First women's 100m semi-final four are 1: 1 Schillonie Calvert (Jam) 11.08secs (Q) (=SB), 2 Asha Philip (Eng) 11.21 (Q), 3 Crystal Carly-Kristen Emmanuel (Can) 11.43 (SB), 4 Toea Wisil (Png) 11.44 (SB).
19.14 Next up is the women's 800m freestyle where Wales's Jazz Carlin goes in lane four Scotland's Hannah Miley in lane one, Scotland's Camilla Hattersley in seven.
19.12 Australia sweep the backstraoke with Mitch Larkin winning gold, Josh Beaver silver and Matson Lawson third.
19.09 In the backstroke it's Main, Larkin, Beaver, 1-2-3 after 100m.
19.08 We're at Tollcross for the men's 200m backstroke final, while at Hampden it's the women's 100m semi-finals.
19.00 Right, the big evening, Top 'ole Tuesday, begins at last. Swimming, athletics, netball.
18.55 Malaysia have won another badminton gold. England had to settle for silver in the team competition as the defending champions came from behind to win a tight final 3-1. The match was not without controversy as Malaysia benefited from a dubious line call at a critical stage of the pivotal and tight men's doubles rubber, helping them into a 2-1 lead.
Malaysia also edged a close men's singles contest after England had opened with a win in the mixed doubles, but the women's singles was more one-sided and the top seeds powered through to gold.
The tie was locked at 1-1 heading into the mixed doubles rubber between world number 13 pair Andy Ellis and Chris Adcock and newly-formed but highly-rated duo Wee Kiong Tan and Wei Shem Goh. The first game was close but the Malaysians gained a significant advantage when an Adcock smash was incorrectly ruled out, bringing up game point. The crowd booed when big-screen replays proved the error but the umpire ignored protests and the Malaysians went on to take the game 21-19.
Two more close calls involving the same judge further frustrated the English pair in the second game but Adcock accepted responsibility for a misjudgment that allowed the Malaysians another vital point.
18.32 Jonathan Liew is backstage at the swimming arena: "This is where the magic happens"

We, the people, are grateful, Jonathan. What a shiny floor.
18.25 The BBC is currently showing the gymnastics, but since I spoilt it for you and me by publishing the standings about an hour ago, I don't think there's all that much I can add. Anyone get their BAGA three badge. Everyone has a four badge, don't they? Forward roll, backward roll, handstand, headstand, cartwheel, crab, squat thrust, star jump?
<noframe>Twitter: Stewart A - The royal family seems to have been awfully lucky in the ballot for tickets for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a> I could only get 3 events :-/</noframe>
18.05 David Dean asks
Does the medal platform at Kelvingrove in your picture look like all six players are members of a Subbuteo team? Oddly it’s two players per stand, so like the 3-legged sack race Subbuteo!
Three-legged sack-race Subbuteo! Now there's an off-shoot they never produced. I had cricket and rugby (both essentially disappointing) as well as football. A friend at school had a strange mini football game of theirs called, I think, Wembley Subbuteo, with a bouncy pitch. Anyone have hockey? Or angling or snooker express?
<noframe>Twitter: Jessica Ennis-Hill - Fantastic performance by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nickmatthew" target="_blank">@nickmatthew</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23gold" target="_blank">#gold</a> after struggling with injury as well! Baby time now <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Esmet1985" target="_blank">@Esmet1985</a> x</noframe>
17.49 What's been happening at the whiff-whaff, you ask. Well, history repeated itself as England were forced to take team silver. Just like in Delhi four years ago, Singapore won, taking gold with a 3-1 victory.
17.36 Matthew says that Willstrop played the better squash and because he felt he had 'glass arms' he won the only way he could, playing 'caveman squash'. Interesting. Jamie Willstrop says 'no complaints, I'm disappointed but I'm almost not. SIx weeks ago I was almost not playing so just to be here was something. I left it out there he just beat me on squash'.
17.31 Having kissed his knee, he goes off to kiss his wife and her bump. Matthew won 11-9 8-11 11-5 6-11 11-5 in a repeat of the final in Delhi, although the manner was markedly different from his straight-sets sweep four years ago. The South Yorkshireman took the lead early and held firm for a win which completed an English sweep of the medals after Peter Barker beat India's Saurav Ghosal in the bronze medal play-off.
17.29 Gold for Nick Matthew who kisses his knee, that was opened up for keyhole surgery on his meniscus only five weeks ago. That's a successful CG title defence for the world No2.
17.28 Match-point for Nick Matthew at 10-5.
17.26 News from the gymnastics where England's men hit the front in their team final and Wales' women also impressed. The five-man team of Louis Smith, Max Whitlock, Kristian Thomas, Sam Oldham and Nile Wilson scored 133.806 across the floor, pommel horse and rings, with the remaining pieces of apparatus to be completed on Tuesday.
Scotland's five of Dan Keatings, Dan Purvis, Frank Baines, Adam Cox and Liam Davie were second with 127.240, while Canada were third with 125.380 ahead of the evening session, while Wales' men were fourth with 122.339 ahead of Australia and New Zealand.
In the women's competition, Wales scored 81.398 after competing on the bars and vault to sit top of the team standings ahead of South Africa and Singapore at the halfway stage on the opening day.
17.21 It's 7-3 to Matthew. Elsewhere there are complaints over the length of time it is taking for spectators to get into Hampden Park for tonight's athletics
17.16 Matthew races into a 4-1 lead.
17.13 We're into the fifth game now. The gold medal game.
17.05 It's all square as Willstrop takes the fourth game 11-6 and has to change his shorts as well as his shirt afterwards. He's absolutely pouring with swaet.
17.02 Willstrop is again fighting back and is 6-4 up in the fourth. He's bossing positionally. (Does that make sense?)
16.51 Nick Matthew takes the third game.
16.45 The Telegraph's Rod Gilmour wrote a terrific book with James Willstrop that is well worth reading. The score in the third game is 8-1 to Matthew who keeps getting strokes due to the sheer size of Matthew.
<noframe>Twitter: Hockeyroos - We cannot confirm, nor deny, the rumour that Prince Harry has just asked <a href="http://www.twitter.com/_TaylorJayde" target="_blank">@_TaylorJayde</a> &amp; Brooke Peris for a selfie. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
16.33 Willstrop levels by taking the second game11-8. His coach tells him to watch the width.
16.30 Willstrop fights back though to 8-5. What a game this is. Frank Keating used to write about squash quite a bit, and played it. I remember reading his reports of his pilgrimmages to Karachi and Peshawar to see Jahangir and Jansher Khan. It's one of those games you have to play to appreciate truly, I suspect. At my age I reckon it would see me off.
16.23 In game three of the squash, Willstrop is 5-4 up. Now it's 5-5, Willstrop having been 5-2 up.

16.22 And here is Ms Povey in action.

16.15 Caroline Povey wins bronze at Carnoustie in the women's trap. her father won gold and silver at the Edinburgh 86 grand boycott games.
16.10 It's 10-9 to Matthew, his third game-ball and he takes the game 11-9.
16.08 Afternoon all. Sorry for the slight delay. I was directed to BBC2 momentarily and ended up watching some people trying to decide whether to live in Australia or Britain. I'll keep you posted. (I won't). Meanwhile at the squash, it's still game one and Willstrop is appealing that he did not obstruct Matthew. The decision is that it's stroke to Matthew. That puts him 9-7 up.
16.00 Well I am going to leave you in the capable hands of Rob Bagchi to see how this all unfolds. Cheers.
15.57 After five points, Nick Matthew has to go off because he's got a problem with his contact lens. "Do you need to change it?" asks the umpire. "Yes, otherwise I can't see!" he says. Didn't catch exactly what Willstrop says but he laughs and says something like "don't let him." Victoria Pendleton among those watching in the crowd.
15.56 The squash is under way. Time for one more shot of the Royals.

15.53 And here are further shots as the Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cambridge enjoy the gymnastics.

15.51 Princes William and Harry, with Kate, are at the gymnastics.

15.48 One of the reasons why this squash final is exciting is that it's the pinacle of the sport, there is no Olympics for squash. These same two men contested the final in Delhi 2010 and it was a one-sided affair, Matthew winning three-zip in just 67 minutes.
15.45 Squash bronze medalist Paul Barker very interesting on the rivalry between finalists Willstrop and Matthew. "They don't like each other, they are chalk and cheese. Matthew is very outgoing, Willstrop likes to keep himself to himself, he likes to be left alone." Nick Matthew the world champion and favourite, Willstrop in a former world number one.
15.42 Lovely place, Kelvingrove, and here's the Messi of lawn bowls getting his medal. Congratulations Alex Marshall and Paul Foster.

15.35 There's a nice blog here from Steve Pye of That 1980s Sports Blog about the 1986 Commonwealth Games. It's about two great sporting rivalries, Adrian Moorhouse and Victor Davis; and Tessa Sanderson v Fatima Whitbread.
15.30 England take on Singapore in the men's table tennis. Six of their last ten medals in the Commonwealths have come in the sport. In the team event, there are five matches and it's first to three wins. Singapore won the first two singles matches but the English won a doubles match to keep it alive. Andrew Baggaley now taking on Jian Zhan and needing to win this singles match to keep it alive.
15.24 A nice little Beeb feature on Beth Tweddle. "I was very shy at school, but as soon as I stepped onto the gym floor that shyness went away and I came into my own. It was the closest I came to flying. I never dreamed of being this big gymnast that got amazing results, i just kept coming through the door because I wanted to beat each challenge that I was set."
15.22 The Aussie women have made it 3-0 against England's hockeyistas.
15.20 Some gymnastics coming up.
15.18 "Not only a great player but the most wonderful ambassador any sport could have. She is so lovely and so humble. If you think about David Beckham, she's bigger than that in Malaysia. She is like a rock star." The BBC commentators on Nicol David.

15.15 Nicol David has won the squash gold. 3-0. She is a classy, classy player.
Laura Massaro admits that she had her chances in the first game but let it slip: "I was 7-4 up and you just cannot give a lead away like that."
15.10 News story from Ben Riley-Smith:
"A weightlifter competing in the Commonwealth Games is to appear in court after being charged over an alleged sexual assault near the Athletes' Village.
Toua Udia, who represents Papa New Guinea, was arrested last Monday over an incident which took place at a Tesco's supermarket in east Glasgow.
The 26-year-old was allowed to compete at the Clyde Auditorium over the weekend despite the allegations, which he is contesting.
He was charged under the Sexual Offences Act at Glasgow Sheriff Court and is scheduled to go to trial on Friday after pleading not guilty.
15.00 Laura Massaro's lost the second game as well.
14.55 More on 13-year-old swimming star Erraid Davies. She says that she celebrated her bronze with toast and Irn Bru. As I recall, Michael Phelps had a diet that wouldn't shame the biggest slob ever. According to the New York Post, Phelps conquered the world while eating:
Breakfast: Three fried-egg sandwiches loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, fried onions and mayonnaise. Two cups of coffee, a five-egg omelet, a bowl of grits, three slices of French toast topped with powdered sugar and three chocolate-chip pancakes.
Lunch: Pasta, and two large ham and cheese sandwiches slathered with mayo on white bread. 1,000 calories energy drink.
Dinner: Pound of pasta and an entire pizza. 1,000 calories energy drink.
For me, it's not the volume so much as the low-quality bulker. Normally it's all poached chicken with these guys, isn't it? I love the choc-chic pancakes.
14.52 Messi there.

14.50 Ah, Nicol David has pinched the first game 12-10. She was struggling but she found a little bit more. Gut punch for Laura Massaro.
14.42 Back to the squash, where Laura Massaro of England is taking on Nicol David, who is considered by many to be the finest women's squash player who ever lived. It's 9-7 to Laura in the first game and David hasn't quite got going yet. poor shot on the backhand from Laura now, unforced error in the tin. But a fine rally from Laura now and she's serving at 10-9. Lovely boast from the back from Nicol David, brave shot. It's 10-10.
14.38 There's women's hockey underway between England and Australia, and Rod Gilmour is there for us.
Big old stick tussle has begun at Glasgow Green. England haven't beaten the Hockeyroos for three years and a loss here will mean that their final group game against Scotland will be a virtual quarter-final starting at the bizarre hour of 9am. Sounds like I've already written off England today....
Well, not without some reason by the sounds of it - the Aussies are 2-0 in the first half.
14.36 Michael Conlan has come through a really tricky fight. "He tried to make it a tough fight, he used the head, unlucky for him that he got warned. I knew he was going to make it hard and I was nervous, he fought a very, very dirty fight. I worked on my defence. The gold medal is the only thing in my eyes."
14.30 Conlan has won that round as well.
14.27 Conlan was on Celebrity Apprentice in Ireland last year! He was fired in week three; the winner was Edele Lynch from B*Witched. Ha, it also featured Nick 'rogue trader' Leeson.
14.26 Thapa is a southpaw. Good opening round, hard to call it, Conlan probably with the better work. Thapa keeps his left had a bit low. All three judges score it 10-9 to Conlan.
14.25 To the boxing ring, where Michael Conlan takes on Shiva Thapa in the last 16 bantamweight. Conlan is the number two ranked bantamweight in the world and the Indian is the number three, but this draw is not seeded so we have them meeting in the last 16. Thapa has not fought yet in the tournament but Conlan has. He was cut in the first fight.
14.15 The Scots have done it in the lawn bowls! Well done to Alex Marshall and Paul Foster.

14.10 Joelle King wins the match and the bronze medal.
14.04 This Joelle King is all over England's gal in the squash bronze match, she's won the first game and looks in control of the second as well.
14.00 Scotland are now 19-0 up against Malaysia in the bowls!
13.54 Jitu Rai of India has won the 50m pistol shooting, his compatriot Gurpal Singh takes silver. Daniel Repacholi of Australia, who won the gold in the air pistol yesterday, is third. He's MASSIVE is Daniel. You wouldn't want to meet him down a dark alley. Especially, you know, if he had a gun and everything. Sure he's a smashing lad, mind you. He looks like a nice chap.

13.47 Talking of squash, the women's bronze match is underway with England's Alison Waters, a solid all-rounder and all-court player, taking on Joelle King from New Zealand, who plays in a similar sort of style.
13.46 Scotland now 16-0 up in their lawn bowling.
13.45 The team table tennis is underway, England going for gold against Singapore
13.40 Peter says "it's both frustrating to win a bronze again but also I am pleased with the consistency as well. Tough to get drawn against Nick Matthew in the semis, he's not World Champion for nothing."
13.31 England's hopes of a 1-2-3 in squash are guaranteed now with Peter Barker taking the bronze against Saurav Ghosal of India. On match ball, Ghosal blocks Barker, and we go to video review.... a stroke is awaded to Barker and he wins the bronze by three games to one. Oh, Prince Andrew is there.

13.30 Scotland are putting the Malaysian bowlers to the sword! The claymore, even. They are 10-0 ahead and are surely going to win gold. All hail Paul Foster and Alex Marshall, they've given Malaysia's pair of Muhammad Hizzli and Fairul Izwan Abd Muin a solid kicking so far after five ends. If Paul and Alex get over the line, it will be Scotland's best-ever medal haul at a Games.
13.10 Jonathan Liew has news from the front. Well, not exactly news.
That shooter has missed a Gault-edged chance to break the Commonwealth record there. And for all those accusing me of making a terrible pun three hours after it was even relevant, all I can say is: Gaulty as charged.
13.00 Okay then, I think we'll leave the athletics for a bit. So what have we got this afternoon? There's boxing, with men's bantamweight Michael Conlan of Northern Ireland in his last-16 fight.
There is squash as Nick Matthew and James Willstrop duke it out for gold, both are English. That's at 3.45pm. And Laura Massaro also squashes for gold from 2.50pm.
At 3pm it's the gold medal match in the mixed team badminton, with England taking on Malaysia.
Starting at Kelvingrove, Scotland are going for glory in the men's pairs lawn bowls, against Malaysia. Paul Foster and Alex Marshall the men we'll be cheering on.
Men's table tennis team final at 1.30pm, where England take on Singapore.
From about 1.30, the proper gymnastics gets underway.
12.43 Bit of medalage as Dan Greaves gets his discus gold, that's England's first gold at Hampden Park.

12.40 In the decathlon shot put, John Lane - who is enjoying a good day - has recorded a PB. Stein, the Aussie who was DQd from the 100m, leads in this discipline.
12.38 Elsewhere at Hampden, the men's hammer qualifying is underway, Nicholas Miller and Alex Smith of England are both through.
12.28 Laura Weightman, a class performer, and Jemma Louise Simpson go for England in the second 1500m heat. Selah Busieni and Faith Kibiegon of Kenya the other major players. Another quick race, by the looks of it. The Aussie Buckman and Weightman bump about 400m out, but both are okay, and now as they come around the final bend it is Kibiegon who wins it by some distance, van Buskirk of Canada in second, Weightman third and Busieni in fourth. Simpson fifth but will go through as a fastest loser.
12.26 "There's not many athletes in this but it is a high quality field," says Steve Cram.
12.23 That was a warmer race than we were expecting, Obiri won it, Muir and Nikki Hamblin also through and Hannah England got a bit of a scare there, she had to put in quite a fight to hold on to fourth.
12.18 An email from Simon McMahon
Afternoon Alan. Another glorious day at Carnoustie for the shooting. Men's 50m pistol final just started. Strong English and Australian representation here today in a lively, generous and knowledgeable crowd. England's Callaghan leads Australia's Repacholi after the first round.
12.12 Some Scottish interest coming up as we get to the 1500m as Laura Muir goes in heat one. Hannah England of, erm, England is in the same heat. Helen Obiri of Kenya is the woman to watch. First four go through from each of the heats and four fastest losers, only 17 across the two heats so not the toughest quali specifications. I just learned that from Paula Radcliffe, who is doing some co-commentary with Steve Cram and is very impressive, delivering a lot of info and expertise very clearly.
12.04 Beard of the day award goes to Martin Rooney. He's about to go in heat 7 of this 400m contest. He's had his injuries and perhaps hasn't quite yet fulfilled his potential, but he did get a 4x400m relay silver in 2009. He wins the heat in 45.57, nice race. "On that evidence, he looks in good form," says Steve Cram.

11.58 Here's Colin Jackson on the 400m and Kirani James of Grenada. For some of the islands this is their major championship. You might think that Kirani might think 'I've won the Olympics...' but no no no. He is a true champion and he wants titles."
11.53 Reader Patrick Kenneth has a view on the blind/visually impaired running (see 10.50)
I agree with your comments but I would add that they also need to sort out why the ladies can be "guided" by a man from another country, especially when the "guide" will get a medal. In the same para category for tandem cycling and triathlon, the guides have to be same gender and nationality.
11.47 In heat four of the 400m mens, we've had two people pull up! Don't see that often, Ghana and Nigeria.
Meanwhile in the decathlon, Ashley Bryant of England has produced the best long jump so far, that's a PB, and he needed it because that was his third jump and his other two were stinkers. Ashley does better in the second day events in the decathlon so if he can hang on in there today...
11.43 Here's James: "It reminds me of an Alabama football game, it is good to run in front of all these fans, I am really proud to come out here and represent my country." I THINK he said Alabama football game. Not really sure what that's about!
11.40 Back to the men's 400m heats and Kirani James canters home in the inside lane.England's Michael Bingham comes home in second, decent effort from him.
11.34 Scotland are playing Wales in men's hockey, the Welsh are 2-1 up in the first half.
11.30 Time for some 400m heats now. England's Nigel Levine has come fourth in the first heat, not good enough for an automatic passage through, but it was quite a hot race so he might be a fastest loser.
11.29 "This is on a par with London, the crowd have been so good. I wanted to put on a great performance. Commonwealth champion, it feels amazing," says Dan Greaves.
"The points probably work slightly against Dan," says Dame Tanni G-T, about this combined classification battle, and she adds that it was a great battle between Dan and Aled that bodes well for Rio.

11.25 Gold in the F42/44 discus for England's Dan Greaves! The Welsh skipper Aled Davies has to settle for silver. That's a big upset, and well played Dan.

11.20 John Lane is coming along nicely in the decathlon, he's just done a lifetime best in the long jump. He got the second most points in the 100m, behind Canadian Damian Warner, so this is most encouraging start from the Englishman.
11.19 It is nip and tuck in that discus, England's Dan Greaves has just edged ahead by a fraction from his Welsh rival Aled Davies.
11.08 Jason Maclean of Scotland has just qualified in the C37 100m (that's for athletes with cerebral palsy and I think it's for athletes with problems with down one side of the body). Fanie van der Merwe though in the other heat looks like he is going to take some beating. Dude is QUICK.
Mention for Jean-Paul Juliette in that other heat, who comes through in 29.10, not going to medal with that time but he has shaved two seconds off his PB. Big up to the man from the Seychelles.

11.00 Northern Ireland have missed out on the gold in the bowling. It's South Africa who take gold in the men's triple.
10.50 Then again, in the blind/visually impaired sprinting we're currently watching T11 and T12 athletes competing on a level playing field. Dame Tanni G-T says "this is one of the events that they're trying to develop." Tracey Hinton of Wales has just romped home in her heat in the 100m women. But Scotland's Libby Clegg looks the woman to beat, having qualified with more than a second clear over her nearest rival. I am in no way an expert but this looks one of the events where they need more precise classifications - you've got blind people against visually impaired people. When there's 10 competitors across three heats and you have times ranging from 12.23 to 15.63 (with four athletes slower than 15 seconds) then a more acute grading is needed. Maybe? Like I say, I am no expert.
10.48 Here's Gareth A Davies, our para sport supremo, with a clarification on the discus puzzler (see 10.22):
The scoring is point-awarded relative to the world record in their different para classifications, this is the only way they can do it at Commonwealth Games where two or more impairment groups may be banded together.
10.37 Qualifying for the women's 100m T12 now (that's blind athletes who run with a guide) and England's Selina Litt has run 14.28 but is a distant second to Maria Elisa Muchavo of Mozambique.
10.33 The Northern Ireland bowlers are not giving up without a fight, they've narrowed the gap to 14-10 after the 14th end.
10.32 There won't be a 19th Commonwealth medal for Mick Gault today, he's failed to qualify from the 50m shooting. And we understand that he is retiring, he's holstering his pistol for the last time after a remarkable career of 18 Commonwealth gongs.
10.22 England's Dan Greaves now in the F42/44 discus with a second round throw of 54.94, but here's the Olympic Champ Aled Davies... and he goes into the lead with a throw of 46.83. Confused as to why he's in the lead having thrown nearly 9m less? So am I. But I working on finding that out. I am guessing this is because Greaves is a F44 and Davies an F42. Yep. There's a weighting system, you get points
10.20 In the third heat, Damian Warner of Canada (who had a bronze at the Worlds in 2013) has run a PB 10.29 in the 100m, and he's put himself in a strong early position. Good run from John Lane, he's put himself second in the standings after the first of the ten disciplines.
10.10 The decathlon is underway and it's a nightmare start for 2012 world youth silver medalist Jake Stein, who has had two false stars! He's disqualified. What an idiot. First time, well, these things happen, but having done that, then you just have to play it safe. He has a proper old tantrum afterwards as well, flinging an arm angrily towards the camera and stomping off. What a wally.
Colin Jackson: "He's let himelf down, and it's not just that, it's everyone else you have let down who has worked with you and coached you to get you here."
Jonathan Edwards quips: "I'm sure Jock Stein has got some memories from Hampden Park, but not Jake Stein." Jock Stein died in 1985 but I think we know what Jonathan was trying to say.
Here's Jake's twitter bio: "Being a decathlete is like having ten girlfriends. You have to love them all, and you can't afford losing one."
Mmm. Jake sounds like a bit of a weapon, to me.

10.00 The men's discus F42/44 is underway and all eyes are on Aled Davies. He throws fifth and goes into second place, but England's Dan Greaves has put up 48.65 and he's the man to beat so far.
09.55 If you want a full, detailed run-down of all the day's action, this is the place to go.
09.45 There's hockey underway, men's, between South Africa and Australia, where the Aussies are 3-0 ahead. Poor Timothy Drummond here has been smacked on the melon by the ball. Bloody hell that has to hurt.

09.35 It's not looking too clever for the Northern Ireland lads in the bowls. They're 6-2 after end 7 and the South Africans seem to be in control. After end 8, the Northern Irish have pulled one back and it's 6-3 to the Saffers.
09.25 Other medals up for scrumps today include gold in the mixed teams badminton, where England take on Malaysia. England's team features Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock, that's a husband-and-wife pairing! The team beat India in the semis with Mr and Mrs Adcock doing the business in the mixed doubles.
They play five matches (Men’s Singles, Women’s Singles, Men’s Doubles, Women’s Doubles and Mixed Doubles).
09.15 Story of the day yesterday had to be Erraid Davies, the THIRTEEN-year-old swimmer who got a bronze in the SB9 100m breasttroke. Lovely quotes too:
"I'm really happy," said Erraid. "It's another PB and I could really hear the crowd in the last 25m. Mum and Dad are here to watch and I'm not sure what we'll do to celebrate later."
Her mother Joyce told BBC Radio 5 live: "Apparently she was going to get some cake and some Irn Bru to celebrate.
"We never promised her anything for doing well in the Commonwealth Games, no rise in pocket money or anything like that!"
09.10 The men's decathlon is also underway today. And there's an Olympic champion on show as Kirani James goes in the (third) heat of the 400m.
09.05 Also today, we have the men's para discus T42/T44, in which the Welsh team skipper Aled Davies makes a medal bid.
09.00 Northern Ireland are in the hunt for their first gold today, in the lawn bowls men's triples. That much is underway now, but the lads are 2-0 down against South Africa early doors.
08.50 There's action in the pool later and English eyes will be on Adam Peaty, who swims in the 50m breaststroke at 8.49pm with a view to adding that title to the 100m gold he won on Saturday.
08.40 Also on the cards today is the men's 50m pistol shooting. The qualifying for that is underway as we speak and then the final is at 12.15pm. It says in our paper that it's at 12.15am but I am assuming that's just a typo rather than the promise of some sort of midnight gun rampage, possibly with night-vision goggles, throught the streets of Glasgow. Anyway, whichever it is, sorry about that.
Why am I telling you about this relatively obscure event? Because Mick Gault of England, who already has a remarkable 18 Commonwealth medals after getting a bronze in the 10-metre air pistol shooting on Saturday, has a chance of a 19th career medal. Remarkable. Here's Jim White with the skinny:
He may not look it, but Mick Gault has just become the most decorated man in English sporting history. When he won the bronze medal in the 10-metre air pistol shooting discipline at Carnoustie golf course on Saturday, it was the 18th time he has stood on the podium in Commonwealth Games. His haul of medals puts him equal in posterity with the Australian shooter Philip Adams. And today, he has the chance to better that extraordinary achievement when he goes again at the longer distance 50metre shoot-out.
“It was really cool,” he said of his performance. “I’m going to have a pint of shandy, and maybe a brandy. But then an early night – it’s training tomorrow.”
Standing on the podium at Carnoustie, alongside the giant, bearded Australian champion Daniel Repacholi, the 60-year-old grandfather from Dereham in Norfolk, looked as if he had taken a wrong turn from the coach park. Short, stocky, thinning on top, he did not have the bearing of the model athlete. But then looks can be deceptive.
“Inside this body is a coiled spring,” he said with a smile. “That was everything. It didn’t matter what colour it was, I’ve got the 18 medals now. That’s exactly what the aim was so it’s job done now. It’s a weight off my shoulders and I can chillax as they say now. I can focus on my next competition, which is in a couple of days’ time.”
08.30 Morning all. Welcome to day five of the Games. Lots to look forward to on this, day five. The big one today is the men's 100m final. Other medals on offer in the athletics today include the men's discus throw F42/44 final, which starts off at 10am. You've got women's hammer at 7.05pm and then men's shot put at 7.20pm. Women's 100m T12 final is at 8pm and Men's 100m T37 is at 8.40pm. Then you've got women's 100m at 9.35pm and then the day rounds off with that men's 100 at 9.50pm.
