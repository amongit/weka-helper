In an era when millions watched the sport on ITV, McManus headlined big bouts against the likes of Kendo Nagasaki, Giant Haystacks and his nemesis Jackie Pallo.
He had a number of nicknames including 'The Man You Love To Hate', and made more TV appearances than any other wrestler in a career which spanned more than 20 years.
Wrestling was hugely popular in the early 1960s and late 1970s because the sport had a regular 40-minute slot before the Saturday afternoon football results on ITV.
