England v Denmark: Liverpool – your country needs you for a job in Brazil and beyond

Roy Hodgson had a second go at managing Liverpool here by including five Liverpool men in his England starting line-up. Some of us can remember a time when people argued that the national team should simply lift a first XI from the best club side in the land, who also happened to be Liverpool.
This was the 1970s and 80s, before the Premier League, Prozone and (in many cases) passing. Again Liverpool were the exception. They would pass you into oblivion. The imperiousness of their play under Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan would have tempted any England manager to send a van to Anfield and bring the whole lot south for national service.
Often seen as a semi-autonomous state, detached from the rest of Britain, Liverpool have been a consistent provider of talent for Operation Sisyphus, otherwise known as England. Here they supplied the man of the match, Raheem Sterling, and the game’s only scorer, Daniel Sturridge, who found the net from the centre-forward’s position despite spending much of his time out wide.
This friendly against Denmark marked the first time since October 1977 that five players from one club had worn the three big cats. After Ian Callaghan, Emlyn Hughes, Ray Clemence and Terry McDermott, England have plundered red Merseyside for Kevin Keegan, John Barnes, Michael Owen, Peter Beardsley, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson, who earned his 50th cap in an England side also containing Jordan Henderson.
This has been a bit of an English obsession since West Ham claimed the credit for the 1966 World Cup victory at this venue. The trident then was Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst. They were the only three Hammers in the 1966 squad. But they did the work of 10 men.

Of course there was no attempt by Hodgson either to revisit his unhappy Liverpool days or appropriate the work of Brendan Rodgers, the present manager. Liverpool are the Premier League’s most upwardly mobile side and bring zest and enterprise to their work. Yet there is no Philippe Coutinho in this England set-up and no Luis Suárez. Liverpool’s exciting format cannot be replicated at international level.
There is a dividend of telepathy and familiarity, certainly, but each member of the Liverpool combo has to be judged as an individual candidate for Brazil. For Henderson the task was to carry his bold, upright, driving midfield play into the England context. Sterling, another well-taught by Rodgers, staked a claim for the main wide man’s place. Johnson, meanwhile, grapples with Kyle Walker for the right-back slot.
Gerrard, the deep-lying quarterback of this side, is a fixture, while Hodgson is unlikely to contemplate picking a big-game side without Sturridge, even with Wayne Rooney (another Merseysider) to accommodate. Together, Sturridge and Suárez have racked up 42 goals and 15 assists.
Understandably there is not the same synchronicity between Rooney and Sturridge. Hodgson’s challenge now is to come up with a structure that allows all these emerging talents to shine. There was not much sign of one here but the sudden influx of contenders was bound to throw up conundrums.
In all cases, think Brazil. What will England need in Brazil? Which players are best equipped to use Brazil as a rapid-development hub?
Certainly Sterling and Sturridge. Lallana, too, is practically running up the steps of the plane. It was Lallana’s slalom-and-chip that provided Sturridge with his winning header. This little group are eager to impress: especially Sterling, who switched right and left and always endeavoured to attack the opposing full-back. In Brazilian conditions, England will need young legs and confidence.
“People looking at Raheem see him as a small boy who can be bullied, or a weak player, he’s the complete opposite,” Gerrard says. “He’s very strong, very robust and the pace he’s got is electric. He’s going to be a big player for his country for a long time and I’m just glad he’s a Red.”
For Euro 2012 Hodgson borrowed Martin Kelly, Johnson, Henderson, Andy Carroll, Gerrard and Stewart Downing. At the 2010 World Cup, Fabio Capello confined himself to Johnson, Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. While Manchester United’s home-grown ‘Class of ’92’ were never able to drag England up to United’s level, this Liverpool quintet ought to be at the heart of the next phase, with the 2014 and 2016 tournaments.
The jobs of Sterling and Sturridge ought to be self-explanatory.Henderson’s is more problematic, because it asks him to control rather than embellish games, and to treat the white shirt of England the way he does the red of Liverpool: as a chance to show how good he is, and why he cost his club £20 million. A problem for him is that there is less creativity in this England side than there is at Liverpool, so more graft is called for.
Anfield is not the only nursery. Around the hour mark the Southampton pair, Luke Shaw and Lallana, started lighting up Denmark’s right flank. The best news in this England cycle is that half a dozen or so 18-24-year-olds have taken a great leap forward in the club game and widened Hodgson’s options. Two sweet second-half through balls from Henderson and Sterling respectively affirmed the value of confidence transferred from club to country.
This was one of those friendliness where the process of “looking at a few players” (the old mantra) was a grand label for a hollow spectacle. But the Liverpool contingent bestowed the same energy that has driven them into contention for the league title: a much bigger immediate priority for them than far-off Brazil.
Never mind that the club’s greatest player was a Scot, Kenny Dalglish.
Message to Liverpool: your country needs you.
