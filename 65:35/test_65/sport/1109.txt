US Open 2014: Martin Kaymer leads at Pinehurst after incredible first-round 65 on Thursday

Golfers are not supposed to do this at the US Open. Martin Kaymer's first-round 65 was the lowest round shot at Pinehurst No. 2 in the national championship.
The resurgent German went wire to wire at The Players last month and the former world No. 1 obviously has the class to emulate his Sawgrass heroics here.
Expect the USGA to sharpen Pinehurst's teeth immediately. Quite simply they do not approve of golfers making six birdies in a single day. Not when they only take one bogey, anyway.
Kaymer did make a five on the seventh but otherwise he was majestic. His back-nine 31 was blemish free in every sense.
Nobody seemed more shocked than the 29-year-old himself. In his practice rounds he found Pinehurst – recently restored to its original glory with no rough but sandy, native areas of wasteland – brutally tough, particularly with the rick hard conditions and turtle-back greens.

"I thought the winning score would be eight-over," Kaymer said. Thanks to him the USGA may now go over the top and ensure it will be. If the rain stays away and the layout becomes firmer and faster, by Sunday a 65 could look absurd.
"I hit the ball solidly and didn't make many mistakes," Kaymer said, veering into the outer limits of understatement.
And there was Graeme McDowell thinking his 68 had been rather accomplished. He came in to the year's second major suggesting Pinehurst would be a scrambler’s paradise and his morning's work compared to that of his playing partner Rory McIlroy seemingly only served to back up the theory.
On two-under. McDowell is three behind alongside the American Kevin Na and the Zimbabwean Brendon De Jonge on a leaderboard which, Kaymer apart, is extremely congested. There are more than 45 players within three shots of second.
For that reason McIlroy was not too dismayed with his 71. Yet if McIlroy is to win a third major here perhaps he will have to take a leaf out of McDowell’s tactic book. “This is Graeme's ideal sort of tournament,” McIlroy said.
Indeed it is. The 2010 champion is in his element when it is all about the grind, although, in truth, the conditions seemed highly favourable to the early starters until Kaymer clicked in to his inexorable motion.
McDowell believes the USGA had watered the course overnight. “We got lucky – we were able to take advantage a little bit and actually think about getting at some of those flags,” McDowell said.
McIlroy thought about it more than his Ryder Cup hombre and, because of this, they provided a wonderful contrast in approaches. McIlroy could not resist the wide open fairways, made so tempting by the recent redesign which returned Donald Ross’s masterpiece to its original rough-free form. However, McDowell stuck to his less powerful guns.
“Rory played the course aggressively and I played it very conservatively," McDowell said. “It wasn't my best ball-striking display, but you don't have to strike it amazing around here, you just have to position the ball correctly. Generally I kept the ball exactly where I wanted it. And I putted very well which I've just got to keep doing this weekend.”
After a bogey on the fourth, McDowell hit a three-wood from 250 yards to 10 feet on the fifth for an eagle. From there it was all pars, apart from a birdie from three feet on the par-four 14th. There were some fine up and downs and some nerveless clutch putting. That appeared the magic formula.
On the same mark as McIlroy is the remarkable English amateur, Matt Fitzpatrick. The 19-year-old actually held the lead when moving to two-under after three holes and despite two successive bogeys from the 14th (his fifth), he showed his maturity by picking up birdies on the treacherous 16th and second. At that stage he was putting his playing partners to shame. That they happened to be the defending champion, Justin Rose, and Phil Mickelson only placed his efforts ever further into fantasy land.
Alas, three bogeys on the last four holes saw him finish one behind Mickelson yet one ahead of Rose. He was unfortunate on his penultimate hole when having to call a penalty on himself after inadvertently moving the ball as he went to pitch.
“I rested my club down, and then it moved and touched my club and I looked at my caddie [Lorne] Duncan and I was, like, ‘whoops’.” Fitzpatrick said. “I suppose I’m pleased and disappointed at the same time.”
Fitzpatrick turns professional straight after this event and on this evidence it will not come a moment too soon. By then Mickelson will hope to have become the sixth player to win the career Grand Slam. The left-hander bogeyed two of the last four, but this was anything but disastrous.
For his part, Rose will simply be happy to have played his second nine in two-under after going to the turn in four-over. His countryman Ian Poulter shot an encouraging 70, as did Paul Casey and Jamie Donaldson. Lee Westwood and Luke Donald struggled to a 75 and 77 respectively. The world No. 1, Adam Scott shot 73.
