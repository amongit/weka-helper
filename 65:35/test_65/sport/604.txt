Victoria Pendleton says becoming a jump jockey is 'daunting, exciting and terrifying'

Victoria Pendleton would like to make it clear that she does not fancy herself as the female AP McCoy.
Nor has the woman known throughout the cycling world as Queen Vic set off on her new sporting direction because she senses there is a gap in the National Hunt market in the wake of the champion’s retirement.
“No,” says the double Olympic champion of her switch from bikes to horses in the attempt to become a jump jockey and compete at next year’s Cheltenham Festival.
“I’m not doing this to win. There’s very little hope of that. I’m doing it to learn something completely new. Just to be able to step up to the start line and not be out of place: that will be something. I’ll be very proud of myself.”
Rather than a calculated attempt to steal McCoy’s thunder the idea that she should switch saddles and take up a different kind of riding came out of the blue, when she received an approach from bookmaker Betfair.

“I got an email — I get a lot — I read it through and thought: the idea of learning something from scratch now actually that really appeals to me.”
Learning something from scratch is no exaggeration. The champion sprint cyclist had rarely even sat on a horse before she was presented with the opportunity to train in Paul Nicholls’s yard, with the aim of competing in the Foxhunter Chase next March, one of the most demanding amateur races on the world’s most challenging jump circuit. It is a bit like someone who has never skied before attempting the Swiss Wall.
Or a non-driver entering the Le Mans 24 hour race.

“It’s a serious long term challenge, building a completely new skill set,” she admits. “Daunting, exciting, terrifying in equal measure. When I went for my first lesson, Clifford, the head lad at Paul Nicholls’s place, told me I was crazy. He’s right. It is insane.”
Not least for someone who appeared to be so relieved about retiring from competitive sport when she hung up her cycling shoes immediately after winning silver in the sprint in the London Velodrome.
Yet she says this idea has been timely. She had, she reveals, been looking for something to fill a gaping void in her life she never expected to feel.
“Competition has never been the thing that drew me to sport,” she says. “It was the process, applying yourself to goals, the regime, the training programme.
"That’s what appeals to me: consistency, repetition, the continual push for learning. I’ve surprised myself but I really miss that.”

Immediately after retiring she entered Strictly Come Dancing, in the hope it might provide sufficient stimulation. It didn’t. She managed eight weeks on the show before being evicted.
“I wasn’t much good at ballroom dancing to be honest. You can say I was fairly average at Latin. An ability to deal with pressure, speed and danger, none of that freaks me out. Doing the samba, that’s what freaks me out.”
Since then, Pendleton has occupied her time designing a bicycle range, taking a course in mentoring, qualifying as a personal fitness trainer and, in September 2013, getting married.
None of that, however, satisfied the fundamental urge to be involved in a sport. Twenty-three years of competitive cycling had ingrained its rhythm in her psyche. Breaking that addiction has proven far harder.
“I’ve missed the routine, the discipline, knowing what you’re doing, where you’re going. I haven’t missed the pressure and expectation. Actually, I’m surprised at how much I missed having a process, having a goal, pushing yourself daily. I really, really missed that.”
One thing she did not want to do, however, was return to her first sport.

"If I went back into it, I’m not sure I could take the pressure to perform,” she says of cycling. “It did at times feel like my life depended on it.
"This is different. I’ve got a different perspective. This is just a horse race. What’s more important here is trying to grow and improve.”
She is, however, starting from a very low base. While every other jockey in the race will have been immersed in the sport from childhood, much as she wanted one as a young girl, horses have never been part of her life.
“I asked Father Christmas a couple of times for a pony, but my dad’s logic for suggesting I stick with cycling was you don’t have to muck out a bike.”
The good news for her, as she discovered when she began her intensive training programme last week, is that her small stature, sense of balance, no fear of speed, and ability to apply herself gives her a flying start. The timetable is pretty stark, though.
This week she will go to Cheltenham for the first time to watch the Foxhunters and see what is required.
Then she will have six months of one-on-one tutelage, learning how to race, perhaps taking in a couple of flat events over the summer, before the point to point season begins in November.
Thereafter there is the small matter of gaining her jockey’s licence and qualifying for next March’s festival. After all, this is Cheltenham, the Olympics of jump racing.
“Yeah, when you put it like that, it looks pretty daunting,” she says. “But I want people to tell me I won’t make it. If people don’t think I can do something, nothing incentivises me more.
"It doesn’t mean I think it’s going to be easy. It will be incredibly tough. I really don’t know if I’ll make it. But I’ll give it my best shot.” Is it time, then, to visit the bookies to make an early investment?
“I’d give it a bit yet, if I were you,” she smiles.
