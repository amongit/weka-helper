Rafael Nadal plays down Australian Open chances as Roger Federer hits his peak

Asked on Saturday to name the most smoothly functioning aspect of his game, Rafael Nadal replied “Nothing”. Admittedly, the reply was delivered with a smile, but it was still a revealing moment in the build-up to Nadal’s opening match against the skilful Russian Mikhail Youzhny, an experienced hand who reached the quarter-finals here in 2008.
We should perhaps acknowledge that Nadal consistently plays down his own prospects before any big tournament, even when the stage is his personal fiefdom at Roland Garros. It is just his way of minimising the pressure on his racket arm.
This time, though, there is more to Nadal’s self-effacement than mere habit. His results since his last grand slam title – and ninth French Open – have been nothing short of horrible: just six wins from 12 attempts, with unlikely setbacks coming against a pair of teenage talents in Nick Kyrgios (the world No 144 at the time) and Borna Coric (then No 124).
At the same time, Nadal has been afflicted by a number of physical issues: the back trouble that poleaxed him during last year’s Melbourne final, a wrist injury that restricted his backhand last autumn, and finally the appendicitis that forced him to pull out of November’s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London last November.
Nadal supporters might reply that post-injury comebacks have been something of a speciality for their hero. In 2013, for example, he went on an absolute tear after a seven-month lay-off forced by knee trouble. Yet here, again, the beginning of the new season has not been kind to him.

He has returned more with a whimper than a bang, losing to Andy Murray in an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi before going down to the unheralded Michael Berrer – who fell in the second round of qualifying here on Thursday – in Doha.
A tally of two defeats from two matches to date could spell one of two things. Either Nadal really is there for the taking. Or he has just been setting up the perfect camouflage, and is about to ambush the rest of the field like a hungry leopard.
“I would be lying if I said I feel I am ready to win today,” Nadal said. “I don’t feel myself ready to win. Last year, yes. But today I don’t consider myself one of the favourites here.
“In theory, playing four or five matches in seven months, you cannot be one of the favourites. If I am here in a press conference in one week, maybe I will say another thing.
“You feel in better shape physically when you play matches, when you have confidence about your movements. It is a question of time and work. I am working big time.”
A very different message was transmitted by Roger Federer, the man who stands one place ahead of Nadal in the seedings at No 2. And this was hardly a surprise given that Federer won his warm‑up tournament in Brisbane a week ago, beating Milos Raonic in an excellent final to bring up his 1,000th career victory on the ATP tour. The Swiss scalpel is looking considerably more lethal just now than the Spanish blunderbuss.
Asked whether he felt he was playing the best tennis of his career, Federer did not demur. “I would hope that over the years I’ve always improved,” the Swiss replied.
“I think I’m serving more consistent and stronger than ever. My backhand is working better than it has in the past. My concentration is better than it’s ever been. The question is confidence, forehand, movement.”
Federer will be supported here by the double coaching team of Severin Luthi, who is also Switzerland’s Davis Cup captain, and his own childhood idol Stefan Edberg. Yet it sounds as if the great man has some bad news to pass on to Luthi in the coming weeks, even if he has not steeled himself to deliver it yet.
Asked whether he intended to defend the Cup – which Switzerland won in a spectacular final in Lille less than two months ago – Federer was decidedly downbeat.
“I will probably decide that when the Australian Open is over. It was always a goal of mine for 15 years [but] clearly it’s hard to get out from the chair after finally winning it.”
