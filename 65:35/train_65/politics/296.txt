Here, Let Joe Biden Shame You Into Working Out This Weekend - NationalJournal.com
First they gave us turnips. Now they give us the vice president doing bicep curls while making calls.
In another push to promote healthy eating and exercise habits, the White House posted Friday a Vine of Joe Biden curling a 30-pound dumbbell while on the job. "I do a million of these a day," he tells the camera and Americans who are not at the gym. "So just gimme five."

Biden is referring to #GimmeFive, the latest health challenge in first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign. The initiative urges Americans to high-five people who they see making healthy choices.
Biden has shamed constituents into working out before. This time last year, the White House released a video of Biden and President Obama jogging in their suits around the executive mansion's grounds. Biden obviously doesn't do "a million of these a day," but the 72-year-old does indeed lift weights to stay in shape.
