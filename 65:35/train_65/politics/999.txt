Ride the GOP Wave
With Labor Day having come and gone, the 2014 fall campaign is about to be in full swing. And to kick it off, the bulk of the reporters and analysts who cover U.S. elections are busy writing stories designed to tamp down expectations that the GOP is going to win big in November.
Their evidence is that none of the hotly-contested Senate races where Republican challengers are nipping at the heels of the Democrats they are running against has broken wide open. North Carolina? Too close to call. Arkansas? Too close to call. Louisiana? Too close to call. And so on and so on. If there was a wave coming, the pundits argue, these races would already have been put away.
That, in a word, is nonsense. Let’s break it down. Only two Republican incumbents – Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts – are in anything like a race. Worries that the GOP-hold open seat in Georgia might flip have largely been put to rest, with none of their other open seats in anything close to jeopardy.

By contrast three of the Democrats' open seats – in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia – are all but over. The open seats in Iowa and Michigan are too close to call, which at this stage is very good news for the GOP since they’ve held neither seat in decades. Incumbent Democrats face varying degrees of serious competition in Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska, New Hampshire, Oregon, Minnesota and, depending on which polls you’re reading, New Jersey.
The Republicans won’t win all those races but they’re a pretty good bet to win more than they lose. It all depends on the size of the wave.
Over in the House, the news is not much better for the president’s party, which has abandoned all hope of retaking the majority. The question is not whether Nancy Pelosi will once again be speaker but what the size of John Boehner’s next GOP majority will be.

The idea of a McConnell-run Senate working together with a Boehner-led House to rein in spending, reform or even replace the Affordable Care Act with something that actually works as advertised, and pushing job-creating measures to the president's desk for Barack Obama to veto all day and all night is one of the worst things a liberal can imagine, which is why they are deluding themselves (and trying to delude the American electorate) into believing the battle for the control of Congress is closer than it really is.
By way of example, in 1994 – the year in which the GOP won control of both houses of Congress, most of the governorships being contested and a majority of the seats in the nation’s state legislatures – the Republicans were still running behind the Democrats by several points on the generic ballot test (“If the election for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Republican candidate or the Democrat?”) the day before the election.
Let’s break down what the mood of the country is like now. The George Washington University Battleground Poll released Wednesday surveyed 1,000 registered likely voters nationwide and found that 70 percent of them believe the nation is “on the wrong track.” Only 21 percent said they think we're heading in “the right direction.”

That’s an enormous gap – the biggest in my memory – in a poll that does not lean one way or the other in a partisan sense. In fact, is conducted jointly by Republican pollster Ed Goeas of The Tarrance Group and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners to make sure nobody monkey’s with the results.
“Though the American public is as divided as it has been all year, as we head into the 2014 general elections the advantage among likely voters is flowing toward Republicans,” the poll's director, George Washington University Political Management Professor Christopher Arterton, said in a release. “Despite the public's antipathy toward Congress, particularly toward the Republican leadership in the House, President Obama has become a lightning rod for discontent on a number of fronts.”
According to the poll, “strong majorities” are unhappy with the job Obama’s doing on the budget and spending (61 percent disapproval), foreign policy (58 percent disapproval), working with Congress (57 percent disapproval) and immigration (57 percent disapproval). And the GOP wins on the economy by 7 points, “with 49 percent of voters expressing more confidence in its ability to find solutions.”

To add insult to injury, the George Washington University (my alma mater) survey has the Republicans with an overall 46 to 42 percent lead on the generic ballot test; in states where there is a competitive race for U.S. Senate, Goeas said, the GOP leads by 16-points, 52 percent to 36 percent.
Sometimes everyone knows the big wave is coming and sometimes they don’t know it’s there until it’s too late to do anything but hope and pray. Just as George W. Bush did to the GOP majority in 2006, Obama’s feckless and indecisive leadership in a number of areas has likely blown it for the Democrats in November. The one caveat to all this is that in most cases people still prefer to vote “for” something or someone rather than simply casting a protest vote. If the Republicans plan on running just a “we’re not Obama” campaign through the fall, then they may find they come up short. They’d be smart to be talking up how things would be different if they ran the Congress, to identify those kind of 80/20 issues where they can make a difference, at least rhetorically, and figuratively stand next to them while explaining why and how President Obama has overreached, overspent and overstayed his welcome.
