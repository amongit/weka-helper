Delhi elections: Kiran Bedi's election in-charge Narendra Tandon withdrawn resignation
New Delhi: BJP's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi's election campaign in-charge Narendra Tandon, who had quit the party on Monday morning in protest against her "dictatorial attitude", withdrew his resignation a few hours later.
Tandon said he will be working for the BJP. This is the fourth time that Tandon has resigned and rejoined the party.
Sources say Tandon withdrew his resignation after meeting party president Amit Shah.
Earlier in the day, Tandon had said, "I have resigned today. I was fed up with the dictatorial attitude of Kiran Bedi and her staff. I tried many times to convey this to the top leadership but nothing has been done."
Tandon, who was in the BJP for 30 years, had addressed his resignation letter to Shah. He said in his letter that he is hurt with the fact that Bedi who had beaten up BJP workers ruthlessly injuring many once is now ruling them.
In a damage control exercise, the BJP tried to downplay the controversy. Harish Khurana, an executive in Delhi unit of the BJP, claimed that Tandon had resigned three times in past as well. "It is his habit to resign and the rejoin the party," he had said.
A BJP leader claimed that Tandon was not the campaign in-charge for Bedi but he was just one of the coordinators.
Bedi, who had earlier refused to comment over the development, said she was not aware of Tandon's resignation.
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogender Yadav demanded a response from Shah as the letter is addressed to him. "Is this 40 years of Kiran Bedi's experience?" he said.
