Baltimore, I Sing of Thee
One is a city of marble halls and memorials; the other is a city of marble steps in its blocks of rowhouses.
Neighbors Baltimore and Washington are so close on I-95 and yet so far, like 40 going on 500 miles away. One is a little long on civic self-esteem; the other is a bit short. When the British came calling in 1814, Washington fled and Baltimore fought.
The tale of two cities is now at the 200 year mark. Aglow with fireworks and Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley in period dress on horseback and singing with his Irish rock band, Baltimore celebrated lavishly this weekend. Not to rub it in, Washington, but if not for Baltimore, the nation’s history might have been very different. O’Malley has been living for this for years, since discovering the story’s splendor.
[SEE: Political Cartoons]
The big party was well-deserved for past military valor and for flying the grandest fort flag ever seen the morning after. Mary Pickersgill, a skilled Baltimore flagmaker, made that “Star-Spangled Banner” with a team of women and girls. It was the biggest job she had in her life. It took six weeks, working night and day, in her household right by the water. It, too, is still there and open as a museum, an unsung national treasure.
In short, the British burnt and sacked Washington and then marched and sailed warships up north to Baltimore, which they bombarded all night long from the water. When the September night lifted, Fort McHenry’s flag stood out clearly against the crepuscular dawn sky.
That heart-filling moment inspired an observer, lawyer Francis Scott Key, to pen the lyrics to what is now the national anthem. That very day, he composed his ode to the brand new flag Pickersgill made with her female workers.
The rest is history. Baltimore saved the night and day for the early republic in 1814. The bustling port city was the third largest in the nation, while Washington was more decorative and symbolic as the federal city, still being built.
The canny Mrs. Dolley Madison made sure to spin the fact that she “saved” a national art treasure. In fact, she directed a servant – or a slave – to cut down a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington before fleeing the president’s house. Dinner for 40 was waiting on the table for the British army officers.

Baltimore built its pride on making things, from clipper sails to spices and steel. So it’s fitting that the lady from that city, Pickersgill, produced something with her hands, of lasting value.
So Baltimore, I sing of thee. While working there as a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, I noted that people tended to identify with their own neighborhood – Mount Vernon, Hampden, Roland Park, Fells Point, Charles Village, Ashburton – more strongly than the city as a whole.
But this time was different. This time everybody got together and felt good about the city’s place in American history. As well they should.
