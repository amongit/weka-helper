Music for the Masses
LOS ANGELES – The New World still lives and breathes in this motley city of story and dream factories. This is where I grew up, but I always see it anew; it never stays the same. That’s the pilgrim soul – or shall we say, the immigrant soul? Even here in the heart of the Brentwood Country Mart, time and place may vary, but we all go back to the boat.
This week of Thanksgiving, that seems apt. President Barack Obama’s adept timing in issuing a broad order on immigration was a master stroke after a long dry spell. We are a nation of immigrants, after all.
In a way, the president gave himself a political Thanksgiving pardon, along with the traditional turkey. Obama lives to fight another day, with another chance to appeal to fairness in the American people. That is what he just did, in making the case for immigration reform, speaking over the House Republican rabble. Good job!

On another note, have you heard the "New World Symphony" lately? On Sunday, eight of us went to hear the Los Angeles Youth Orchestra play the Antonin Dvorak masterpiece. The stage was bursting with fresh bright eyes, including our extended family’s talented string player, Griffin Smuts.
The Czech composer, who knew New York well, premiered the work in Carnegie Hall in the 1890s. Wild cheers greeted him, and why? This was a foreign composer creating a celebration of America in the great era of immigration. New York’s Ellis Island, Baltimore’s Fells Point and other port cities were greeting immigrants by the millions, setting sail from the Old World.
These immigrants followed in the wake of those brave dreamers who arrived on the Mayflower ship and made the 1620 Mayflower Compact shortly after land ho, with the men – of course, men like Myles Standish – drawing up and signing the original governing document for Plymouth Colony.

Many in the later waves and multitudes who came were Jewish, from Russian and Polish villages where they had no chance under the tsar. In Baltimore, a handsome red brick building on the water, known as the Fells Point Recreation Pier, was where immigrants learned English, found work through networks and held community dances. They helped to form a new foundation for our country in 20th-century arts, academia, journalism, politics, the garment industry, law, science and medicine.
Diversity, toleration and inclusion are part of the bedrock of our national character, and now is the time to keep that in mind, as political storms pass over sea and land.
At the symphony, we heard stirring lyrical passages in the early movements, heightened with melancholy melodies from old African-American spirituals. The last movement captures the questing grandeur of the American spirit and the horizon. Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9 serenades listeners all the way through, restless and exhilarating in the end.

Resounding applause filled Schoenberg Hall on the UCLA campus. Russell Steinberg, the orchestra’s artistic director, trusted his musicians to make the beautiful, prophetic symphony their own, and they did.
My four-year-old niece fell fast asleep in her uncle’s arms. My father Richard, a music sage, said the “warhorse” sounded splendid anew. I was thrilled to be there for the first live symphony the small children in our group ever heard.
Because they heard who we – the people – really are, at our best.
