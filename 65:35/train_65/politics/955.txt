The Opposite of a Slow News Day
Wednesday turned out to be pretty busy for the blogosphere. It was one of those days where, rather than being too little to write on, there was almost too much. Congress is gone, leaving a lot of business on the table, including the critically important issue of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act reauthorization. But it also accomplished a great deal by approving the so-called "cromnibus" that keeps federal discretionary spending on the downward trajectory that started with last year’s sequester.
The GOP claimed an additional congressional seat in Arizona as a state court determined that Republican Martha McSally had won a recount in the state’s 2nd congressional district. This gives the party its largest majority in the U.S. House of Representatives since the 1920s. So much for the analysis that the election of President Barack Obama marked the birth of a new and enduring liberal-left coalition that would realign American politics.

Speaking of the president, he announced Wednesday that, as part of a deal redeeming one American hostage in exchange for three Cubans held here on issues related to espionage that he was moving forward toward normalizing U.S. relations with the Castro government. This set off a predictable firestorm among Republicans (and a few Democrats) who see no value in regularized trade between the two countries or in regularized relations between Washington and Havana. It may boost the spirits of the “red-diaper babies” scattered throughout the Obama administration who were raised on notions of Cuba as a tropical workers’ paradise, but those whose families fled the Communist regime, like Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, were on the edge of apoplexy.
Calling the deal “a victory for oppressive governments and a serious setback” for the Cuban people, Rubio blasted the president’s announcement on CNN. “The White House has conceded everything and gained little. They gained no commitment on the part of the Cuban regime on freedom of the press, or freedom of speech, or elections,” the potential 2016 presidential candidate said, adding that Obama and his administration “have let the people of Cuba down.”
Obama’s weakness in foreign policy and national security matters, at which the Cuba announcement hints, was fully on display in Peshawar, Pakistan, where authorities are still removing the carnage left by the massacre and maiming of several hundred schoolchildren and their teachers by guerillas linked to the Taliban. So much for winding down the prosecution of the war on terror in nearby Afghanistan, something the liberals who oppose U.S. involvement in Iraq used to tell us was the “good war.”

The Russian economy is collapsing, thanks in part to the rapid decline in the price of crude oil. It may destabilize things in Eastern Europe for a while, but it also forces Vladimir Putin to live for a while within his means, meaning the pressure might be off Ukraine and the Baltic States, at least for now. Credit the ingenuity of the American engineers and oil workers who came up with “fracking” for this one, for it is their increase in productivity – which Obama and his liberal allies have fought every step of the way – for this victory, such as it is. Of course, this was also the day New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration announced – after nearly four years of deliberations and just about four weeks after an election – that the Empire State would abstain from the fracking revolution, even as Pennsylvania reaps a windfall from productive fields immediately on the other side of their joint border.
So rather than be one of those days when there isn’t enough to write about as Christmas draws ever closer, Wednesday turned out to be a day when there was almost too much news coming down the information pipeline to process any of it an orderly and thoughtful fashion. None of the stories will be going away anytime soon. As they say in the news business, they all “have legs.” There was more to this piece but hackers, probably acting at the behest of the peace-loving, non-threatening, benevolent leader of the People’s Republic of North Korea, slipped in and nipped it out.
