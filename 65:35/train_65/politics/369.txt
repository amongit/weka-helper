I apologise to BJP leadership for not delivering what was expected of me, says Kiran Bedi
New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi has apologised to the party leadership and the workers for not delivering what they expected of her.
Speaking to mediapersons after it was obvious that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would register a record victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, Bedi said, "I apologise to the BJP party leadership and the workers for not delivering what they trusted me with. I want to aplogise to them as I could not live upto their expectations."
Bedi, who herself lost from BJP bastion of Krishna Nagar to AAP candidate SK Bagga, did not accept that she had lost as a CM candidate. "I have not lost. Let the BJP assess. They have a strong cadre base. I am an integral part of BJP. I have not lost. The BJP has lost. The BJP will see to it," she said.
However, she took the responsibility for the party's miserable defeat. She said, "PM (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) was not the CM candidate. I was the CM candidate and I take the responsibility. That is the reason I apologized," she said.
She said she did not think that she had lost because she had performed her best. "I would have lost if I had not done my best," she said.
Bedi thanked the BJP leadership saying it inspired her to join the party. She also thanked it for choosing her as the CM candidate.
She said the BJP did not take any money from me for fighting elections.
Bedi said, "I am happy that I got an opportunity to work like this. I am thankful that I was able to see the massive divide that the earlier government of the Congress has given us. I was surprised to see the difference between rich and poor," she said attacking the Congress.
Prompted once by the mediapersons, an emotional Bedi said, "Please let me finish. I may be speaking like this for the last time."
She profusely congratulated her colleague-turned-rival and AAP chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal on his victory. "Full marks to Kejriwal and team. Arvind Kejriwal has been working for the urban poor. This poll result is of five years of hard work of Arvind Kejriwal and his people," she said.
Bedi advised Kejriwal to now work for building Delhi and narrow the divide between the poor and the rich. "The poor needs maximum help. They suffer the maximum due to corruption," she said.
She also advised Kejriwal to move away from confrontation politics and work uintedly for the development and progress.
