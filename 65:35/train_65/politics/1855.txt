Bill Cassidy Vows To Use His New Senate Seat To Fight Obama Policies
Republican Bill Cassidy says he will use his new Louisiana Senate seat to continue fighting President Barack Obama's policies.

But the man who defeated Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in a runoff Saturday isn't offering many detailed policy alternatives.

Still, Cassidy said on Fox News Sunday that Republicans are best for working-class Americans. Democratic policies on health care, energy and immigration are wrong and kill jobs, he added.

Cassidy defeated Landrieu on Saturday with 56 percent of the vote.

His victory will give Republicans a 54-seat Senate majority in January. In the House, the GOP will have its largest majority since Democrat Harry Truman was in the White House after World War II.

And the GOP will hold every U.S. Senate seat and governor's chair from the Carolinas to Texas.
