Ron Paul: Congressional Black Caucus Opposed War Because They Wanted To Spend Money On Food Stamps Instead
Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) said earlier this month that members of the Congressional Black Caucus opposed war because they wanted to spend money on food stamps instead.
During a radio interview with Lew Rockwell that was first highlighted by BuzzFeed, Paul said that he was always annoyed with those who opposed war but supported sanctions.
"I was always annoyed with it in Congress because we had an anti-war unofficial group, a few libertarian Republicans and generally the black caucus and others, they're really against war because they want all that money to go to food stamps for people here," Paul said. "But when it came to sanctions, they just could never vote against sanctions because that would prevent war and they wanted to look tough and they'd go on with the sanctions but never get the results that they thought they were gonna get."
The comments come as Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), seems to be gearing up for a presidential run. The Kentucky senator -- who has worked to reach out to black voters -- has distanced himself from his father's isolationist views.
