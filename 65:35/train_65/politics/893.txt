Obama Concedes Mistakes
President Barack Obama admits that voters may be "ready to see me go off to the next thing" when the 2016 presidential election rolls around.
"I think the American people, you know, they're going to want that new car smell," Obama told ABC Sunday. "You know, they want to drive something off the lot that â€“ that doesn't have as much mileage as me."

He has conceded that his low job approval ratings hurt Democratic candidates in the midterm election earlier this month, and he expanded on that idea. "When you've been president for six years, you know, you've got some dings," he said. "You know, they're probably not going to be looking at me to campaign too much....I suspect that folks will be ready to see me go off to the next thing."
Discussing the possible presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton, who was Obama's secretary of state during his first term, Obama said, "She's not going to agree with me on everything. And, you know, one of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions, and have a clean slate, a fresh start." He said Clinton and other possible Democratic candidates, whom he didn't name, "would be terrific presidents."
Obama added: "I am very interested in making sure that I've got a Democratic successor. So I'm going to do everything I can, obviously, to make sure that whoever the nominee is, is successful."
