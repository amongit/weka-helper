American Angst: Voters Worry About Their Country
MIAMIâ€”I've been traveling on the East Coast during the past few weeks, giving speeches about my books and talking about the problems in Washington. And everywhere I've gone, from Boston to New York, Baltimore, Charleston and Miami, conservatives, liberals and independents have asked the same question: What's wrong with our "leaders" in the nation's capital?
The question has taken on more of an edge than it did on similar trips in the past. People are paying close attention as an extraordinary number of crises, failures and clashes erupt day after day, while President Barack Obama and legislators in Congress are unable to get their act together and fail to solve the nation's problems.

A retired businessman from Georgia, talking politics over a lunch of chicken salad and squash soup, said he was worried about the remaining two years of Obama's presidency. He said the powers that be in Washington, including Obama and majority Republicans in the House and Senate, seem headed for one collision after another over immigration, the Keystone oil pipeline, the budget, global warming, national security and other issues. He fretted that the United States was becoming a laughingstock abroad and that America's adversaries, including Islamic extremists, will be tempted to confront the USA because the nation's leaders seem so divided and weak. Many other Americans of different political stripes expressed similar feelings during my trip.
An investor from California said she was making plenty of money but worried about the state of the economy for the middle class. People are getting angry, she said. "I'm afraid for the country in the next two years," she told me. Others wondered if President Obama was trying too hard to placate potential pro-Democratic constituencies with giveaways and amnesties. This line of thought was based on Obama's health care law, which was often seen as a way to give the poor health insurance and make other constituencies pay for it, and on Obama's goal of halting the deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants, which was seen as a way to court Latinos.
Many conservatives with whom I spoke were pleased with the Republican takeover of the Senate and the addition of several seats to the GOP majority in the House in the midterm election earlier this month. But many expressed concern that zealous Republicans legislators would now go too far and force a government shutdown or take extreme positions on legislation that would damage the Republican brand. Conservatives also expressed disappointment in the emerging field of Republican presidential candidates for 2016. The field was widely considered weak.

Liberals argued that the Democrats would rebound in 2016, when they expected a much larger turnout of core Democratic constituencies than occurred in the midterm. But liberals were jittery about the sheer number and intensity of the problems facing Obama, ranging from Islamic terrorism to a resurgent Russia and continued wage stagnation at home. They feared that these problems would cause his job approval ratings to drop even lower and tarnish the party as a whole.
"I wish we had elected Hillary [Clinton]," said a teacher from California who had backed Clinton for president in 2008 until she lost the Democratic nomination to Obama. The teacher, a self-described Democrat, added that Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state and an ex-first lady when her husband Bill was president, would have been more decisive and pragmatic than Obama. But the teacher expressed concern that Clinton would be hurt by Obama's record if she runs as expected for the White House in 2016.
This wasn't a scientific sample, and these voters skewed toward the right although they were by no means monolithic. But I found several things revealing. Overall, my impression after talks with scores of voters was that the opinion polls are accurately reflecting a widespread anxiety around the country. Americans differ on what's gone wrong. But they are worried that their country is off track; they see no immediate prospect of fixing what ails us, and they have concluded that there is no end in sight to Washington's dysfunction.
