Mitt Romney: I Would Have Done A Better Job Than Obama
WASHINGTON (AP) — Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney says there is no question in his mind that he would have been more effective in the White House than President Barack Obama. But he reiterates he has no plans to run again.

My time has come and gone, Romney told Fox News Sunday.

Romney cited continuing high U.S. unemployment and growing troubles abroad, and that some of those who voted for Obama might now have some buyer's remorse.

Yet he said he didn't want to dwell on the past, while admitting he had made mistakes in his campaign — and that the Obama campaign did a good job on picking up on them.

Romney said, "I'm not running and not planning on running."
