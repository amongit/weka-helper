I am not contesting from New Delhi or elsewhere, says Shazia Ilmi
New Delhi: Amid reports that Shazia Ilmi may contest against Arvind Kejriwal from New Delhi Assembly seat, the former AAP leader on Wednesday said she will not fight the upcoming Assembly elections from anywhere.
In a late night tweet, Ilmi said, "Was invited to speak at the National Defence College. Couldn't take media calls. I am not contesting from New Delhi or elsewhere, calm down folks."
Ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, Ilmi is likely to join the Bhartiya Janata Party on Thursday. She will be campaigning for BJP in upcoming Delhi Assembly polls.
Just a few days after the Lok Sabha election results, in which AAP had failed to make much impact in large parts of India, Ilmi had resigned alleging lack of internal democracy within the party.
Ilmi lost the 2013 Delhi elections contesting from RK Puram seat by 326 votes against BJP candidate Anil Kumar Sharma.
