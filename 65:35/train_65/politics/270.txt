Swing Voters Hold Key to Immigration Debate - NationalJournal.com
The winner of a political argument is often determined by two things: timing and framing.
In the case of immigration reform—at least the specific battle over President Obama's executive order last week—the policy is put in place, and it is unlikely that it will be successfully legislatively or judicially overturned before he leaves office. The question here is who wins the political argument surrounding the issue? How does the public opinion come down?
Critical to victory on either side are the moderates, independents, and soft partisans who constitute swing voters. These are the people who shift the balance to one side or the other, either accepting a policy as reasonable or condemning it as ill-advised or even illegitimate.
The timing of this battle is important; no fight occurs in a vacuum. What has been said and done previously can and often does shape the public's frame of mind as it enters into a new policy conversation. Are people inclined or disinclined to give a president or a party the benefit of the doubt on a subject? Or have preceding events poisoned the well of public opinion? If people have been largely pleased by a party prior to the commencement of a new fight, the odds are pretty good that the public will look kindly on a proposal. But if the public has become disgruntled or alienated by previous fights, skepticism is likely the dominant emotion. The burden becomes that much tougher on that president or party to win an argument.
The framing of a policy argument matters. When people seize on one particular aspect of an issue, thereby potentially ignoring other important elements involved in that same issue, the framing can drive the conclusion.
Thus, which aspect the public chooses to focus on matters enormously. People react to what they perceive the question to be, rather than carefully looking at every angle of the debate and considering the issue holistically.
In this immigration fight, in terms of timing, Republicans go in with an advantage. President Obama, in turn, goes into battle with underwater approval numbers, both overall and in most specific issue areas, including his handling of the economy, health care, foreign policy, and yes, immigration policy.
The public doesn't appear likely to give him the benefit of any doubt. While the Republican Party's numbers are upside down as well—indeed worse than those of Democrats or even Obama—this is the president's policy that is being debated and judged. Whether that is fair or not is irrelevant. Voters will approach anything Obama proposes with more than a little skepticism, so he has a heavier burden of proof. Had this occurred in the immediate aftermath of the government shutdown, when the public focus had been largely centered on the Republicans' role in that debacle, this would not be the case. However, for most Americans, at least those in the middle, the shutdown and threats of defaulting on the national debt are now ancient history that they can barely remember (of course, Democrats and liberals recall that moment in political history with vivid clarity). Should there be another shutdown, debt default, or the immediate prospect of either, all of this will have to be recalculated.
How this fight is framed is the immediate and most relevant issue at hand. Will people see this sweeping action as a case of Obama exceeding his constitutional and statutory authority? If the perception is that Obama is acting in a dictatorial manner, then that would put the thumb heavily on the scale for Republicans winning the argument. But if the focus is more on the failure of Congressional Republicans to act on this pressing national problem, that while Obama's move is more aggressive and broader in scope than similar actions by Presidents Reagan and Bush (both "41" and "43") it is not unreasonably so, then that is advantage Obama.
Few are suggesting that it is feasible to deport all of the estimated 12 million undocumented people in this country. To the extent that this is in mind and that the new policy would in effect prioritize those who should and should not be deported—setting up a mechanism for many who are not national security threats and have no serious criminal offenses to stay, work, pay taxes, and become productive members of society—then public acceptance clearly would have a much better chance. If people are focused on the scale and legitimacy of the action as opposed to the effect, Republicans win.
Less relevant to the debate are all of those with knee-jerk partisan or strictly ideological responses to all things Obama, whether pro or con. We know what they will think before an issue even comes up. It's the group in between that is key.
