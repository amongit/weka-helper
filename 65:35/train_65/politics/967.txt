Obama's Epic Immigration Flip-Flop
Based on news reports and strategic leaks, President Barack Obama will announce (finally) his plans for dealing with the American immigration crisis.
Up to now he’s milked it for all it’s worth. To him and those around him, the issue is an opportunity to drive a permanent wedge between Hispanic voters (current and future) and the GOP, which would, if demographic trends are all one is concerned with, make the Republicans a permanent minority party in about a generation and a half.
The flaw in that argument is that immigration is not just about demographics or just about Hispanics. There are plenty of Asians and quite a few Europeans (from east and west) who’d like to resettle here, as well as plenty of Africans – and all for just about the same reasons that brought many of our ancestors here in the first place.
On immigration, Obama would rather look good than do good. He’s dissembled on the issue so often that his credibility is as strained as Vice President Joe Biden’s sense of humor. Announcing simply that he’s going to stop the deportation of – What is the latest number? Five million? – non-citizens living in the United States without the benefit of permanent residency status doesn’t help anyone. To make further use of an already over-taxed metaphor, he’s just kicking the can down the road.

Here’s the dirty little secret. It should be obvious to anyone who gives it more than a second’s thought that he’d rather have the issue than a solution. The argument, at least as far as he understands it, makes him look good to Hispanic voters and makes Republicans look bad. This, folks need to get ready to understand, is the sum total of the White House’s objectives for the remainder of his time in office. (That and a possible deal with Iran that reintegrates it on overly-favorable terms into the global family of nations while maintaining Tehran’s effort to weaponize nuclear materials and put them on missiles pointed at Israel and U.S. interests in the Gulf region, while overlooking the fact the mullahs who run the country have been at war with the United States for more than 30 years.)
Back to immigration. The rub here, as House Speaker John Boehner’s press office pointed out in a more than 2,500 word release issued this week, is that Obama is heading to Las Vegas to do exactly what he has previously said – at least 22 times, according to the speaker’s office – he had neither the authority nor the inclination to do: create immigration law on his own without any input from or the agreement of Congress.
Here he is on March 31, 2008: “I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we’re facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And that’s what I intend to reverse when I’m president of the United States of America.”
Or this from July 1, 2010: “[T]here are those in the immigrants’ rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. … And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.”

Or this, which attracted considerable attention when he said it on May 10, 2011: “Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that’s not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what I’m committed to doing.”
And this, finally, from August 6, 2014: “I think that I never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power]. I’m bound by the Constitution; I’m bound by separation of powers. There are some things we can’t do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. … Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I don’t have a green light. … My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but it’s going to be longer-lasting.”
The full document can be found on Boehner’s website. The point is that the president’s change of mind or change in direction should come as a surprise to no one despite what he has said previously. His may not be the most transparent administration in history (as he promised it would be in the 2008 campaign), but it has been one of the most political. The consistent attempt at partisan one-upmanship is the Chicago way: Knock the other guy down, no matter what it takes and then, when he is down, kick him hard in the ribs and stomp on his wrist. The sooner the Republicans figure out they need to come up with an incremental, manageable and acceptable solution of their own design, the faster the problem will begin to be addressed as it should be. Obama won’t set the agenda because he has no agenda to set. The GOP must lead from Congress – and bring him along with them.
