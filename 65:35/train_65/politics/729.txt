Obama's On His Game
Have you heard the news? Take heart: President Barack Obama's golf game is getting better.
Well, I think we can all rest easier tonight. A shout-out to The New York Times for reporting this backstory with proper gravitas. From the sound of it, Obama's intensity about playing golf approaches President Dwight Eisenhower's. Swinging "Ike" left the presidency the same year Obama was born, 1961, so they have a cosmic connection – a link, so to speak. And you thought the Republican five-star general and the Democratic freshman senator didn't have anything in common. (They also have Kansas is common.)

I, for one, am taking this improvement in Obama's golf as a good omen for 2015. Let me tell you why. For starters, a fresh boost of confidence and energy could help an aloof character revive a fighting spirit. Golf might make Obama feel and act like a winner again after a long slump in the White House. In fact, his approval rating is looking up lately, close to 50 percent.
Secondly, Obama knows he has to change his game right now in his second term. If he did nothing, 2015 could not be any worse than last year or the year before, for that matter. The last two years, the president and lawmakers got nothing done together. So it will likely be judged as the most unproductive quarter of Obama's presidency. The American people don't like to see ennui in a withdrawn president – think of Teddy Roosevelt's exuberant personality. Since his party got trounced in the last election, Obama knows now is his best chance and perhaps his only hope of starting anew. Despite the losing streak, he's a crisp, clear and extremely competitive thinker on how to win at the end of the day. In other words, it's too early to count him out.

The recent White House-Cuba diplomatic deal indicates that shifting the president's governing style is under way, going the same direction as his golf game.
All the Washington players come to town tomorrow. The Senate is changing uniforms, with the majority Democrats on the cusp of becoming the minority. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell with be the majority team captain, a lifelong dream. All arrivals are sworn in Tuesday at the Capitol, with a dash of pageantry. Obama won't be there in person, but hopefully will make some kind of gracious gesture to his first all-Republican Congress from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Good sportsmanship never hurts for gaining higher ground and actually gives Obama a way he could best Eisenhower, who often had a nasty temper when he played golf.

The Obama we are about to meet might feel liberated to speak directly to the people who elected him. More of a loner in office than recent presidents, he never did that well working with Democratic leaders in Congress, anyway: Senator Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi may feel he leads with his head, not his heart. That is true. Nor does Obama does enjoy consulting inside advice and strategies from senators who used to be his senior colleagues. As a freshman senator, he was hunting for larger game.
Before the State of the Union address, Obama is embarking on a bold campaign-style swing through three states to pump people up himself. These solo political events play to his rock-star strengths and serve as a reminder to friend and foe that he is the president of the United States. He can't let the Senate and House be the only games in town. This sense of being on his own, stretched unencumbered, may concentrate his mind wonderfully.
Just one thing: In the rocky game ahead, there are no mulligans.
