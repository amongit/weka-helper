Hillary Clinton staffs up in New Hampshire

Jeanne Shaheen (D) win re-election last fall to lead the emerging Clinton campaign operation in that state, Democratic officials said. Clinton is expected to formally announce her presidential campaign next month, but top staff are already unofficially on the job in at least two states with early primaries, as well as in New York City where Clinton plans to house her campaign headquarters. In New Hampshire, which has the nation’s second nominating contest, Democrats familiar with the hires said Clinton has selected Mike Vlacich, who ran Shaheen’s 2014 reelection, to be the state director. Harrell Kirstein, who was Shaheen’s 2014 communications director, will reprise that role for Clinton, and Shaheen political director Kari Thurman will be a senior political aide in New Hampshire, the Democrats said. Democrats who confirmed the hires asked not to be identified because Clinton has not yet announced her candidacy. The three New Hampshire hires were first reported Friday by the Associated Press, the Boston Globe and WMUR. Shaheen’s victory was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak midterm year for Democrats. The race was closer than expected, with Brown taking 51 percent of the vote to former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown’s 48 percent. Shaheen is close to Clinton and the two are longtime political allies. The governor expected to play a big role in Clinton’s New Hampshire campaign. Clinton campaigned for Shaheen, including a rally the weekend before the election that marked Clinton’s final stump appearance for the cycle. In Iowa, which holds the first contest of 2016, Clinton’s campaign is expected to be headed by Matt Paul, a political adviser to former Gov. Tom Vilsack. Brenda Cole, a seasoned Iowa campaign aide, will also play a senior role, CNN reported Friday.
