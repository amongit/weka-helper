Seattle channel for police body-cam videos draws attention
SEATTLE (AP) - When a Seattle television station sought copies of patrol-car dashboard videos from the city’s police department, it took four years and a trip to the Washington Supreme Court for the records to start being provided.
But as a dozen officers have started wearing body cameras in a pilot project to record interactions with the public, the department has taken a vastly different approach under new Chief Kathleen O’Toole. It’s voluntarily putting blurry, silent versions of the videos on YouTube, giving the curious a chance to see what they entail while also protecting the privacy of those depicted.
“It’s the way the chief wants us to do business,” says Mike Wagers, the department’s chief operating officer. “It’s her way of thinking: Transparency equals an increase in public trust.”
Communities across the U.S. have clamored for more officers to be outfitted with the tiny cameras since a white officer shot and killed an 18-year-old black man in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer. President Barack Obama wants to spend $74 million to equip 50,000 officers with them. The shooting of Michael Brown wasn’t filmed, and so evidence that could have shown whether it was justified was never created.
As the devices’ popularity spreads, though, many departments are struggling with technical questions of how to handle the vast amounts of footage collected, or how to redact the videos if necessary. It has become a key topic in government accountability, at the intersection of concerns about surveillance, privacy and police use of force.
Lindsay Miller, a senior researcher with the nonprofit, Washington, D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum, said she’s not aware of any departments beside Seattle that routinely publish body-cam videos.
