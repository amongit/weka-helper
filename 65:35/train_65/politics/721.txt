The Tides They Are a Turnin'
He was soaring high in the sun over the Selma bridge; she was lying low underground in a bunker.
Oh yeah. Tides of history are turning as we speak. Just a moment ago, she was coming in, while he was going out on a somewhat subdued note. The Democratic Party was set for an orderly history-making transition at its convention in Philadelphia. Game on would get started in the general election.
But Barack Obama’s presidency runs best when he performs as a solo artist. Congress takes too much bruising teamwork. On Saturday, he gave one glorious stem-winder speech to the people, truly something for everybody’s cause, and no doubt one of his last as president. What better metaphor for American advancement than a long march that is not yet over? In 1965, when civil rights marchers were beaten bloody, who would have dreamed there'd be a black American president 50 years later? Not Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a young man when he led the march at the time, who returned to the scene of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in tears this weekend.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton could only hope her chance would come to give her own address as president. But she still believes in a place called Hope. She couldn’t let her best-laid plans go awry over some 50,000 pages of e-mails she handed over to the State Department (when asked). There must be a good reason for keeping a private account to do government business. If only she could remember why she thought it was so smart. Maybe she outsmarted herself. But it's clear she'll have some explaining to do when she addresses the issue in an upcoming news conference.

Ever since the young Hillary Rodham went east to Wellesley College and gave a daring, subversive speech at the class of 1969 commencement, she felt she was bound for greatness. She belonged to the first generation to inherit the gains of the women’s movement. Her next move, to Yale Law School, was essentially breaking down the doors of an all-male privileged preserve. And she was a pioneer.
Like her or not, ready or not, Hillary Clinton is one of the proverbial “best and brightest” of her generation. Not one of the best and brightest women, but one of the best and brightest, period. When he was young in the 1970s, Bill Clinton worried that Arkansas might squelch her from reaching her dreams and destiny.
Whoever’s up or down, in or out now, Obama and Hillary Clinton share ineluctable traits in common. In the 2008 race, each represented history and democracy marching forward toward enlargement. They were, in a way, both on the bridge back in 1965.

In his concluding words, Obama declared:
Because the single-most powerful word in our democracy is the word “We.” "We The People." "We Shall Overcome." "Yes We Can." That word is owned by no one. It belongs to everyone. Oh, what a glorious task we are given, to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.
Leaving aside the self-congratulatory “yes we can,” the president is the president. Those lofty words will live on through time, and it’s great to hear Obama’s rhetorical voice hit his high notes.
Let Hillary Clinton rise to her best self again soon. We the people need her in top form, too.
