Obama Touts Economy in Final Pitch
President Barack Obama is winding up his midterm election campaign with a special pitch to core Democratic constituencies, especially women and African Americans.
"Right now, women make up almost half our workers," Obama said in his weekend address to the nation. "More women are their family's main breadwinner than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing polices that benefit women--because that benefits all of us."

He called for "equal pay for equal work"; paid family leave for women so they can care for a new baby or an ailing parent or recover from an illness "without running into hardship"; providing more benefits to pregnant workers, and insuring "quality, affordable child care."
Obama made similar points during a speech at Rhode Island College Friday. "The idea that my daughters wouldn't have the same opportunities as somebody's sons? Well, that's unacceptable," he told students, faculty members and others.
On Sunday, the president told rallies in Connecticut and Pennsylvania that he and the Democratic party need a strong turnout of supporters to prevent major Republican victories in Tuesday's midterm election, when control of the Senate and House will be at stake.
"You've got to ask yourself: Who's going to be fighting for you? Who's going to be on your side?" Obama asked Sunday evening at a Philadelphia rally that consisted mostly of African Americans.

At an event in Connecticut to promote Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy's re-election, Obama was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers who objected to his policies on immigration, especially the deportation of people who entered the United States illegally.
Overall, Obama has become an unpopular figure in several states that have competitive Senate elections Tuesday, including Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana and North Carolina, The president is a drag on Democratic candidates there so he has mostly stayed away from those states.
Only 40 percent of Americans nationwide approve of Obama's job performance, a decline of three points from Thursday, according to the Gallup poll.
Obama argued that his economic policies have improved Americans' lives. "Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs," the president said in his weekend address." For the first time in six years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past six months our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003."

Obama also is calling for an increase in the minimum wage, creating new jobs through government spending on infrastructure, and raising taxes on the rich.
The problem for Obama and fellow Democrats is that many Americans don't believe their economic situation has improved, and millions of people are under-employed or have given up looking for work; they aren't included in the jobless rate.
Republicans say the Obama administration has hamstrung the economy through excessive regulation and by keeping taxes too high. "The wind's at our back," Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible 2016 presidential candidate, told CNN. "This election is going to be a referendum on the president."
