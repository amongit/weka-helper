Amid concerns about security threats at the Winter Olympics, Mitt Romney said Friday he would feel comfortable bringing his own family to Sochi.
"The answer is yes," said Romney, who was in charge of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, during an interview on NBC's Today show. "I believe the Games will be safe ... that doesn't mean there's a 100% guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world."
Romney, who was critical of Russia's politics during his presidential bid last year, said he believes the Russians are doing "everything humanly possible" to protect the Games, which will run Feb. 7-23.
"There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing in Sochi," he told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. "The level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level. ...The hard sites will be safe. The athletes will be safe. Spectators, when they're in the venues, will be safe."
Romney said it is the "soft places" outside of venues where "you can't be 100% certain about security."
