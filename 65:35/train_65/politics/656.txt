Do-Nothing Congress No More? 2015 Senate Amendments Pass 2014 - US News
Three weeks into the new Congress, Republicans in charge have already kept one of their major campaign promises: to reopen the regular amendment process. New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has allowed votes on 16 amendments, surpassing the 15 amendment votes his predecessor, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., allowed in all of 2014.
Does that mean Congress is getting more done – or less? All but one of the amendments so far have been on a single bill to build the Keystone XL pipeline extension. And the upper chamber has passed just one bill so far this year, reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.
But the bar has been set extremely low for the 114th Congress to outpace the last two: The divided governments of the 112th and 113th Congresses were the least- and second-least productive on record, passing just 283 and 286 laws, respectively.
Americans took notice. More cited "government" as the country's No. 1 problem during 2014 than the economy.
With Republicans back in control of both sides of the Capitol, McConnell wants to show the GOP can get things done. They expect to send more legislation to President Barack Obama’s desk – but whether he’ll sign their bills is a different question altogether.
