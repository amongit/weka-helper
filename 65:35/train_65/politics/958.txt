Don't Be a Scrooge About Phrasing
The Christmas season is again upon us.
It is a time for bonhomie, glad tidings and good wishes, a time to share the joy that comes from being brothers and sisters created in the image of the author of the universe. It is not a time for division, insult and offense but, unfortunately, that’s what the so-called "War on Christmas" all too often brings.

In an effort to put the issue to rest, let’s be clear about something: The expression “happy holidays” is not an insult despite the fact that some people who use it in lieu of “Merry Christmas” have been intimidated into a posture of fearfulness by those who make it their business to find something offensive in all kinds of ordinary social interactions. We have all been intimidated to some degree. Rather than say the wrong thing to a person who does observe Christmas, we employ strategies and words that are attempts to convey the joyousness that abounds at this particular time of year by talking around it. It casts an unfortunate pall over those few weeks almost exclusively devoted to peace on Earth and goodwill toward men.
Believers in the true meaning of Christmas – as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ – understand that He came into this world not to judge it but to save it. Through His life, death and resurrection He conquered sin, taking on for Himself the penalty meant for others in order to restore the broken relationship between Creator and creation. He is, as Pastor Don Davidson of The First Baptist Church of Alexandria, Virginia is fond of saying, the first gift, one born out of God’s love for us all.

There is plenty of room for all kinds of expressions of the season. To take offense from them is to be at war with love, a very special kind of love set apart from those associated with commonly earthly desires. It is not what He who is celebrated at this time of year intends.
If you don't believe, please don’t bark at someone the next time they say “merry Christmas” to you. Think about what they are wishing you, what they are sharing out of their own belief. And if you do believe, and someone says “seasons greetings” or “happy holidays” consider first that they are, perhaps out of fear of being impolite, trying to honor the spirit of the time without offending anyone. Don’t correct them, just smile and say, “And a very Merry Christmas to you.” Your countenance alone might just extend to them the meaning of the season; at the very least it will warm your own heart, and you’ll be that much gladder for doing so.
