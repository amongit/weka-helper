'The Professor and the President'
"The Professor and the President" is a slim volume, written by Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus and a bright Washington denizen since the Eisenhower 1950s. His memoir is an act of fond friendship for the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the polyglot Harvard professor who went on to be an advisor to President Richard Nixon, U.S. ambassador to India and a Democratic senator from New York until 2001. The book is a valuable witness to the inner workings of a secretive White House in process – its policies and the clash of strong male psyches that shaped it. Lavish thanks given to former staffers, one now a senator, paint a picture of how Washington white men helped young Ivy League men advance in the pyramid of political power.
Only Hess could have written this double portrait of Moynihan and Nixon, early in his White House years. For one thing, Hess was there, and he was young. There's a streak of James Boswell, Samuel Johnson's biographer, in observations that come from a knowing character study. He also illuminates the ideological struggle between Moynihan and Arthur Burns, a pipe-smoking economist, over what became known as the Family Assistance Plan, largely Moynihan's initiative. (The initiative did not pass in Congress. But Moynihan gave it a good college try.)

After a book talk at Brookings, Hess tells me that penning this personal history brought "closure" in reconciling the vindictive man heard on the Watergate tapes with the Nixon he once knew and served, first on a losing governor's campaign in California and later as Moynihan's deputy on the Urban Affairs Council. As he reflects back on turning 80, Hess recounted this tale with zest, delighted to recapture one of Washington's most original, charming and brilliant men in that period – the man he calls "Pat" in the narrative. The man with the bow tie and impish smile.
Moynihan's opposite number, Nixon, won a close and bitter campaign in 1968. During the transition, he sought comfort in an Ivy Leaguer or two of his own to soothe his demons about his lack of "eastern establishment" credentials. His staggering loss to John F. Kennedy, ever the polished Harvard man, back in the 1960 presidential election, was salt in a wound that already festered within Nixon. He recognized that Moynihan might give a new face and voice to welfare reform that would surprise and quiet his liberal critics.

Moynihan often seemed to have his head in the clouds of ideas, but it quickly became clear he was a savvy political player, as a Democrat in a tough new Republican administration at the end of the 1960s would have to be to survive. The best that can be said of 1969 is that it was not as terrible as 1968. Yes, one good thing happened: A man landed on the moon – yet that was a goal that Kennedy had set. The nation at that time was unruly, restless and deeply divided on the Vietnam War, still shaken by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy and rocked by the 1968 city riots. Taking power in such a state of flux was no easy thing, but Moynihan was bound and determined to cross party lines if he could calm urban problems. He grew up in a poor household in New York, so poverty was a personal experience.
"I'd like to have the urban equivalent of Henry Kissinger's job on the National Security Council," Moynihan said clearly at the outset.
Moynihan met Nixon at the swanky Pierre Hotel in New York, and the deal was sealed. So he became the other Harvard house intellectual in the Nixon White House, the one on the domestic policy frontier. Nixon cared and knew far more about foreign policy, so the inventive Moynihan was pretty much left to his own devices. As the White House tapes later showed, Nixon practically locked himself in his hushed office – often alone, or with Kissinger, the other Harvard intellectual, who mapped out Nixon's foreign policy. Once again, we see Nixon as either a misanthrope or a severe introvert, or both. He did ask "Pat" for a top ten reading list.

Hess gives us more backstory on Moynihan's motivations, partially to reclaim and redeem the late senator's reputation. In 1965, the leaked "Moynihan Report" on the black family caused a furor that followed him relentlessly. "Nixon, this strange ally, has made him an Ahab of the white whale of welfare reform," Hess writes. I might add that swimming against the Democratic Party's currents made Moynihan more trustworthy to Nixon. Moynihan was a bit of a contrarian, all the way through. He could have helped President Bill Clinton's health care reform more than he did.
What left me with a stab of angst was Hess' notes in the book on Donald Rumsfeld as an "attractive, ambitious young congressman from Illinois" whom he recruited to come head the executive branch's Office of Economic Opportunity. And yes, Hess brought Dick Cheney with him to the White House. There is no comment from Hess on his small part in instigating the wrongheaded leadership and wars of the George W. Bush presidency.
