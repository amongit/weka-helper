The Liberal Pundit Hypocrisy Over Sasha and Malia Obama - US News
It is surely difficult to have the president of the United States for a father.
Life in the fish bowl is never easy. It’s hard to have a normal upbringing when a Secret Service detail has to accompany you on sleepovers and crowds gather whenever you go out for ice cream. It’s probably doubly-difficult when you are at that awkward stage where childhood is almost a memory, and adulthood is approaching faster than you can fathom.
It’s not my job to tell Barack and Michelle Obama how to raise their children any more than it is their job to tell me how to raise mine – excepting, apparently, what they are fed, what’s in their school lunch, how much exercise they get, whether the companies that make the cereals they eat can advertise on television and how long I have to keep them on my health insurance. What they do with their daughters Sasha and Malia is their business, and they have not invited me to stick my nose into it.

At least they hadn’t until the president decided to include his daughters in the White House ceremony where he extended an “official” pardon to a turkey on the eve of Thanksgiving. That event – thanks to a social media post by a Republican Hill staffer – has blown up with all the force of a deep-fried holiday bird improperly thawed.
The staffer in question – who I shall not name to save her any further embarrassment – posted on Facebook some pointed comments about the how the girls looked and acted while on stage. For this, and likely more because she worked for a Republican on Capitol Hill, she was found guilty in the court of public opinion of having committed what is in essence a thought crime. She has been attacked, pilloried, her name and address were posted online and records relating to an incident that occurred when she was a juvenile have been disclosed on a web site.
She has since apologized. She has also resigned from her job, the de rigueur thing to do in politics when a congressional press aide starts making more headlines than the boss, even if it is over something that is as much a tempest in a teapot as anything can be. In my judgment, she has conducted herself with more grace than the White House, which – if the rumors on the right side of the blogosphere are to be believed – drove the story and pushed it out to the press over the long holiday weekend.

It may not rise to the level of threatening to punch in the nose, as Harry Truman once did, a music critic who gave an unflattering review of his daughter Margaret’s singing. The president, any president, has the right to stand up for his children just as any parent does. Calling on your minions to do your dirty work, if that’s what happened, is questionable.
It is also counterproductive for a troubled presidency because it underscores just how thin-skinned the current president is. He could have handled the business with far more grace, if it really bothered him, diffusing the situation with a call to the young lady in question or to her boss in which he could diplomatically accept on behalf of his daughters whatever apology was offered.
What this particular staffer said about the president’s daughters was pointed and less than flattering. It was also nowhere near close to the underhanded, disdainful, uncharitable remarks made by elected officials, media types, journalists and Democratic surrogates about the Reagan children and the adult children of Bush 41. Or what was said about Bush 43 daughters Jenna and Barbara and the entire Palin clan, children and grandchild alike. They, we are told, are all fair game because they had done things that caught the public’s eye – or at least did after the newspapers, blogs and television networks pushed the story on them. Seems to me that standing next to your father when he’s officiating at a White House event rises to the same level; it may even exceed it. Once again, we have an example of the bias that exists in the media concerning those on the left.

It is not necessary to defend the young GOP aide’s remarks; she has apologized for making them and acknowledged the president’s daughters could have interpreted them in hurtful ways. That should put a period to that part of the discussion. What should be discussed in the coming days is whether the consequences she has been forced to endure are in any way equivalent to the perceived offense given. I suspect reasonable people might argue they are not.
There is a “cult of personality” surrounding the current occupant of the Oval Office, one that harkens back to days in which leaders enjoyed maximum authority over the regimes they led. In those days “thought crimes” were not only commonly charged but saw the individuals who committed them lose their liberty at the hands of the state. Is that where the whole political correctness movement is taking us? Now is the time for that conversation – while it can still be had.
