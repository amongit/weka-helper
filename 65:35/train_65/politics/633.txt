Go Big and Go Home: Many Americans Want a Larger House
Some prefer brick exteriors over siding. Others like the look of shingled roofs. But nearly 60 percent of Americans agree that their ideal home would be a different size than the one in which they currently live.
A Trulia housing study out Thursday found that 43 percent of more than 2,000 survey respondents would prefer living in a larger home. About 40 percent of Americans are satisfied with the size of their current house, while only 16 percent would prefer to downsize.
“The responses to our survey show significantly more demand for larger homes than for smaller ones,” Trulia housing economist Ralph McLaughlin wrote in a statement accompanying the survey results. “But the reality, of course, is that households must make trade-offs between things like accessibility, amenities, and affordability when choosing what size homes to get.”

Roughly 60 percent of respondents between 18 and 34 years old are dreaming big, saying they’d prefer a home-size upgrade. Only about 13 percent of those in that age group want to downsize.
Nearly half (48 percent) of respondents between 35 and 54 years old – who are closer to or are hitting their peak earnings years and are generally in a better position to bump up – would prefer to go big when going home, while 14 percent would prefer smaller living quarters. The group was also the most likely to have children in the home, and respondents with children were about twice as likely to want to upgrade (39 percent) than downgrade (18 percent).
Respondents at least 55 years old are most likely to say they’d prefer downsizing, though only 21 percent of that demographic said their ideal home is a smaller one. More than half of respondents in that age range (53 percent) said they already live in an ideally sized home, while 26 percent want more room.

The survey suggests Americans’ desire for space isn’t limitless; as home sizes increase, the percentage of respondents who say they want a bigger place contracts. About 69 percent of households living in less than 800 square feet wanted a larger home, while 13 percent would prefer to downsize.
About 29 percent of respondents in homes larger than 3,200 square feet, meanwhile, said they’d like to get a bigger house, while 26 percent said their ideal home would be smaller.
“Those living in the biggest homes are most likely to have gotten a home larger than their ideal size,” McLaughlin wrote. “And those in the smallest homes are probably the ones feeling most squeezed.”
It appears only a fraction of the country is buying up massive homes that come with steep prices, though. While new and existing home sales were both down in January, about 71 percent of new homes sold had a sale price cheaper than $400,000, while only 4 percent of homes sold for at least $750,000. The average sale price of existing homes in January was only $248,100.
