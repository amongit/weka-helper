If need be, Kejriwal and I will beg for development of Delhi: Manish Sisodia
New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Manish Sisodia said on Friday that the party's chief minister-designate Arvind Kejriwal and he will beg before the public for funds to building infrastructure of Delhi and if need arises, they will cut the salary of the ministers.
Talking to CNN-IBN, Sisodia said they could not believe the mandate the party got in Delhi.
AAP won 67 of the 70 seats for Delhi Assembly elections, results of which were declared on Tuesday.
Talking about the massive mandate the party got, Sisodia said, "People have full faith in us. Sometimes people have so much faith in us that we ponder if we can fulfill the promises."
Sisodia claimed that whatever promises the AAP has made to the people in the budget is possible to be fulfilled.
"We will start installing CCTV cameras. In the next five years, 15 lakh CCTV cameras will be installed in Delhi....We have examples from Bangalore and other cities about successful installation of CCTV cameras," he said.
Sisodia, who is being tipped to be the Delhi's deputy chief minister, claimed that he had made efforts to install CCTV cameras in his constituency also.
Talking about the other important promise of providing free Wi-Fi in the national capital, Sisodia said, "In certain bandwidths, we will give free Wi-Fi to the public."
On the security of women, which was a major issue during the elections, he said AAP wants to provide a panic button to each woman in Delhi.
Sisodia also dealt with the issue of cutting the electricity bills by half and said the AAP government will not fight with the power companies. He said the priority of the AAP government will be to expedite CAG audit of the power companies. Also, the government will order inquiry against the company if the meters are found faulty. "If they do their work honestly why should we do something?" he said.
Buoyed by the massive mandate which AAP got, Sisodia said Kejriwal represents a new form of politics, unlike Congress and BJP. However, he said the party will welcome any criticism.
Sisodia evaded a question on the reason behind senior lawyer and one of the founding members of AAP Prashant Bhushan missing from the dais along with Kejriwal the day election results were announced.
Sisodia, the No. 2 in AAP, said the party will never compromise on its core values as AAP has not there to do politics. "We do not have any candidates with criminal history and we will not spare anyone if any case comes up against him or her," he said.
Asked why he is being made the deputy chief minister, Sisodia, who is considered very close to Kejriwal, said, "Because there is good synergy between Kejriwal and me."
The two will fully focus on Delhi for the next five years though Sisodia said he wanted AAP to work in every part of the country.
He also spoke on attacks on minority school and said it needs to be ensured that such incidents do not happen.
Sisodia said he fully backed Somnath Bharti, who was a minister in Kejriwal's 49-day government, but has not been included this time around.
Speaking on the spread of AAP, he said 30,000 new volunteers have joined the party in the last six months in Delhi.
