Michigan records requests revised, but costs can be high
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - After Tess Brown lost her job at Lansing Community College, she submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records that might help her understand why, after 18 years, LCC believed her position no longer was needed.
Twenty days later, an LCC official responded - not with records but with estimates of retrieval time and the cost of fulfilling her request. LCC said it could take more than 2,400 hours to locate the records and likely cost Brown more than $48,000.
LCC asked Brown for a good-faith deposit of $12,000, plus her written pledge to pay the balance of all “chargeable costs.”
“If you do not want to spend such large amounts of money, we suggest that you . narrow your request .” J.R. Beauboeuf, LCC’s director of legal services, said May 15, 2014, in a letter to Brown.
“I was shocked when I got that dollar figure back from them,” Brown told the Lansing State Journal ( http://on.lsj.com/1GLs0Ll ). “I didn’t feel my response needed to be narrowed. … But I didn’t have the means to fight it, so I let it go.”
Ten months later she remains unemployed and empty-handed in terms of records and understanding her dismissal.
