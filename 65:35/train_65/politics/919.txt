Obama Pulls in the Dough
President Obama may not be welcome to campaign for vulnerable Democrats in competitive states but he remains a big hit on the fundraising circuit.
Obama has attended 55 fundraising events so far this year, including events Tuesday in New York City and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps track of such data. Democratic officials haven't yet disclosed how much Obama has raised for his party in 2014 but it's clear that the total has been many millions of dollars. He is scheduled to visit the home of actress Gwyneth Paltrow in Los Angeles Thursday for still another fundraiser. Tickets cost up to $32,400 per person.

In Greenwich Tuesday night, Obama made a spirited partisan pitch. He called for an increase in the minimum wage, more federal investments in infrastructure such as roads and bridges, laws guaranteeing pay equity for women, and increased federal spending on early childhood education. He added: "There's a reason why we can't get those things done right now, although we're doing everything we can administratively to advance the agenda. The reason is because you've got a Republican party, particularly in the House of Representatives, that's ... become captive to a very narrow, ideological set of beliefs that think government has no role to play in providing opportunity and that believe that ... as long as folks at the very top are doing well and we eliminate regulations on polluters and the financial system, somehow prosperity will trickle down."
Obama said the Democrats have a different view: "When middle class families are doing well, when there are ladders of opportunity and everybody who works hard can get ahead in this country, that's when everybody does well."
While Obama is a big draw at fundraising events for his party, many vulnerable Democrats including Senate candidates in Alaska, Arizona and Louisiana don't want to be seen with their president. They worry that he is too unpopular in their states and will drag them down to defeat in the Nov. 4 elections.
