GOP Brands Obama a Naysayer
Republican leaders have come up with a caricature of President Barack Obama they think will undermine his new strategy of aggressively confronting the GOP in Congress: naysayer.
Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told reporters, "Will President Obama do what's right and listen to voters' priorities? Or will the president's desk be where commonsense legislation goes to die for the next two years?"

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Obama's veto threats from earlier this week "anything but productive." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex., another GOP leader, called the veto threats "premature" and "deeply irresponsible and troubling."
White House officials said Wednesday that Obama would veto a Republican-sponsored bill that would reduce the number of people who qualify for employer-based health insurance under the president's Affordable Care Act. Earlier this week, White House officials said Obama would veto any bill approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the United States. White House officials said Wednesday that Obama would veto legislation that would give banks more time to dispose of some high risk investments, because such legislation would erode consumer protections in existing law.
The midterm elections of November resulted in Republicans taking control of the Senate and expanding their majority in the House.
