Rally held near state Capitol to kick off Sunshine Week
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A rally was held across from the state Capitol in Nashville Sunday to kick off Sunshine Week.
Open government advocates who gathered on War Memorial Plaza urged media organizations to attend open meetings and make more Freedom of Information requests.
U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper was among those attending the rally organized by The Tennessean newspaper.
The Tennessee Democrat said a lot of the information that the public needs to know, and has a right to know, is hidden in plain sight. He also quipped, “Sunshine is the best disinfectant.”
A recent review of thousands of federal court records conducted by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse found that media organizations were filing fewer lawsuits challenging federal government secrecy than in the past years.
