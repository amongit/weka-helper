Here's What It Was Like In D.C. The Day Obamacare Passed
WASHINGTON -- The day Obamacare passed Congress in 2010 featured a witches' brew of political movements and historical forces. As the long-sought dream of health care reform was becoming a reality, members of an ascendant tea party movement descended on Washington to protest and old-guard Democrats marked the moment with a symbolic walk to the Capital. Amid the history, however, were some heated and disturbing moments, according to the recollections of those who were there.
In this segment of "Wait, Is This Thing On?" Sarah Kliff of Vox, Jeffrey Young of The Huffington Post, Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News, and Julie Rovner of Kaiser Health News, discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly from that day and what it was like to be in the middle of it.
