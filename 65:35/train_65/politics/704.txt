The Numbers Behind the CIA's Interrogation Report
The Senate Intelligence Committee released hundreds of pages detailing the CIA's use of torture in fighting the War on Terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. The report provides a long awaited look at what interrogation techniques the agency used in its secret international prisons and the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of those methods.

Here are some of the data points from the report:
499 pages: The summary of the report, which was released, totals almost 500 pages. Several other documents were released alongside it, such as a foreword from Dianne Feinstein and a response from the CIA. The complete report, which remains classified, totals more than 6,700 pages. The White House, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Director of National Intelligence's Office all received the classified report.
119 detained: There were 119 individuals we know of who were in CIA custody. Thirty-nine underwent "enhanced interrogation" â€“ at least 40 percent without authorization from CIA headquarters. Seven of those provided no intelligence while in custody. Others provided significant information before or without enhanced interrogation. Most of the interrogations happened in the five years after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Order 13491: President Obama signed this executive order in January 2009 to prevent the type of treatment described in the report, allowing the CIA to only hold detainees on a "short-term, transitory basis" and to only interrogate using techniques included in the Army Field Manual.

20 claims: The Committee examined the most frequent examples of the effectiveness of the techniques cited by the CIA, finding them "wrong in fundamental respects," because of correlation, but not causation between the techniques and information, because the information was already available from another source or was obtained before the techniques were used. The Committee says the CIA left "the false impression the CIA was acquiring unique information from the use of these techniques."
180 hours: Sleep deprivation was a frequent form of enhanced interrogation, and involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, or for more than a week. Techniques also included slapping, slamming detainees against walls, nudity and waterboarding. At least five of the detainees subjected to sleep deprivation began having "disturbing hallucinations." Detainees at one center were kept in complete darkness, shackled in cells with loud noise or music and had only a bucket for human waste. One of the prisoners at this center eventually died from suspected hypothermia after being held partially nude, chained to a concrete floor.
Three threats: CIA officers threatened at least three detainees, telling them they would harm their children, sexually abuse their mothers or cut their mother's throats. One interrogator told a detainee that he would never go to court because "we can never let the world know what I have done to you."

Five water "baths": At least five were subjected to "rectal rehydration" or rectal feeding.
Four countries: The centers where the interrogation took place were in various countries, but according to the report, the CIA did not inform other government officials working in those countries about them. In two countries, the CIA informed ambassadors only after the country had agreed to host sites. In two other countries with active negotiations, the CIA told local officials not to inform U.S. ambassadors.
$180 million: The two psychologists who developed the interrogation techniques, neither of whom had experience as an interrogator, specialized knowledge of al-Qaida, a background in counterterrorism or "any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise," created a company in 2005 for the specific purpose of working with the CIA. The value of the contract the CIA made with the company was over $180 million. Contractors made up 85 percent of the workforce for the detention and interrogation operations.
26 detainees: The CIA held at least 26 detainees who did not meet the detention standard. These detainees often remained in custody for months after the CIA decided they didn't meet the standard. The detainees included "an 'intellectually challenged' man whose CIA detention was used solely as leverage to get a family member to provide information, two individuals who were intelligence sources for foreign liaison services and were former CIA sources, and two individuals whom the CIA assessed to be connected to al-Qaida based solely on information fabricated by a CIA detainee subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques." In the case of at least four detainees, CIA headquarters instructed detainees be held at prisons in the host country because the detainees did not meet the standards, despite lack of any other reason for the host country to imprison the individuals.
$300 million: The program cost over $300 million in non-personnel costs (separate from the $180 million). These costs included funding for constructing and maintaining detention facilities, including two that were never used because of concerns from the host country. The CIA provided millions in cash payments meant to encourage governments to support hosting sites or to increase support for current sites.
16 findings: The Committee summarized its findings into 16 key points:
