Should a small business upgrade to Windows 8.1?
Microsoft has just released the upgrade to Windows 8 (matter-of-factly called Windows 8.1) . What does it mean for small businesses and should they upgrade?
A closer look at what's new in Windows 8.1
Definitely upgrade. It's free, it brings some great user interface enhancements, search improvements, and makes Windows 8 feel polished. It's definitely worth its cost (free for existing Windows 8 users!).
What are the new features that relate to small businesses - businesses that donâ€™t have dedicated IT departments or network administrators.
There are plenty of improvements geared towards enterprise environments, including Workplace Join, Work Folders, and etc--I focused on the features that a small business would immediately find useful.
