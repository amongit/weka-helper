CSC teams with HCL, SAP on cloud migration services
Global IT services company CSC continues to extend its cloud-related solutions. Under a new alliance with SAP and HCL Technologies, the company expects to accelerate migration projects that involve moving applications to the SAP HANA platform.
The initial focus will be on several specific industry sectors: banking, engineering, construction and operations, and public sector applications, the companies said.
"Customers want greater innovation, optionality, speed and agility from their IT applications and are turning to hybrid cloud solutions to achieve value quickly," said Jim Smith, executive vice president and general manager, Global Business Services at CSC, in a statement. "Leveraging our global-scale applications modernization collaboration with HCL along with the power of SAP HANA, we will help clients quickly adopt new processes and capabilities that enhance overall competitiveness."
Among the specific services and solutions that are planned as part of these extended relationships:
Over its lengthy partnership with SAP, CSC has handled more than 2,500 different implementation. It employs more than 7,700 consultants (almost 10 percent of its entire workforce) that are specifically focused on SAP solutions: in particular, the two companies co-sell banking software and services.
