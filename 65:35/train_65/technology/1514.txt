BMC, Compuware take aim at mainframe costs | ZDNet
Two of the biggest mainframe software companies, BMC and Compuware, are integrating three key technologies which they say will drive mainframe cost savings for customers.They say that web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications are drive increasing mainframe transaction volumes, driving up costs which CIOs need to keep under control.The companies said the integrations are the first of several they plan as part of a broader partnership that also includes use of each other's technology within their own organizations.The three technologies are:The companies point to one integration which uses BMC Cost Analyzer to call Compuware Strobe for a detailed analysis of the specific application component for peak MLC periods. This allows the customer to proactively tune applications that have the greatest impact on their monthly software licensing costs, the companies said. Integration with BMC MainView allows customers to either automatically or manually invoke Strobe performance analysis, letting mainframe staff more quickly and consistently perform cost-saving while tuning tasks. According to Bill Miller, president of ZSolutions and Select Technologies for BMC, "The integration of our key solutions helps mainframe customers achieve even greater cost efficiencies as they cope with the challenging combination of intensifying business demand and tight resource constraints."
