EMC beats HP as enterprise storage spending ticked upward in Q4: IDC | ZDNet
The worldwide enterprise storage and services market demonstrated healthy growth by the end of 2014, based on IDC findings. Six Clicks: Shopping around for cloud storage According to the market research firm's fourth quarter report published on Friday, revenue rang up to nearly $10.6 billion, inched upward 7.2 percent year-over-year.Total capacity shipments were up 43.7 percent during the same time frame to 31.8 exabytes for the quarter.Proclaiming the fourth quarter results as "a strong finish" for the year overall, IDC research director Eric Sheppard reflected in the report that growth was "driven by traditional year-end seasonality, demand for midrange systems that incorporate flash capacity, and continued growth of systems designed for hyperscale datacenters."For the year overall, enterprise storage systems factory revenue worldwide grew 3.6 percent to $36.2 billion. Full-year capacity consumption also shot up by 43 percent to 99.2 exabytes.IDC defined a Disk Storage System to consist of "a set of storage elements, including controllers, cables, and (in some instances) host bus adapters, associated with three or more disks," but results do not cover infrastructure storage hardware (i.e. switches) and non-bundled storage software. Furthermore, results are attributed to the seller or brand behind the product -- not the manufacturer. At the top of the leader board was EMC, garnering 22.2 percent of all spending worldwide during the three-month period. The IT services giant beat out Hewlett-Packard, which accounted for 13.8 percent of spending to grab second place. IDC analysts said Dell and IBM wound up "in a statistical tie," as each held roughly nine percent a piece. NetApp filled out the top five with approximately 7.2 percent of the global market share.
