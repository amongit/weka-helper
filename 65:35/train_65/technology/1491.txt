Toshiba launches new enterprise-ready SAS HHD range | ZDNet
Toshiba has launched 12Gbit/s SAS interface models to its Enterprise Performance Class HDD model line for companies with heavy mission-critical workloads. Announced on Wednesday, the tech giant said the new additions to the 15,000 RPM Enterprise Performance Class HDD product line, the 12.0 Gbit/s SAS interface 512 native and Advanced Format models, are designed for enterprise clients with mission-critical workloads -- due to improved host transfer rates and enhanced power management features for use with rack-based data centers. The new 2.5-inch form factor AL13SX series is available in capacities up to 600GB, double the capacity of previous 2.5-inch models. Advanced Format models offer Toshiba persistent write cache technology for improved data integrity in un-aligned write scenarios. Clients can also opt for models with self-encryption features. Toshiba says the 12.0 Gbit/s SAS host interface Enterprise Performance Class HDD delivers up to twice the host transfer bandwidth as older 6.0 Gbit/s SAS models. The company says the 2.5-inch form factor offers better storage density, which saves rack space in data centers as well as reducing operational burdens and mission critical storage footprints. John Rydning, IDC research vice president for hard disk drives commented: Samples of the AL13SX and Advanced Format enterprise HDD products will be available to ship later this month.
