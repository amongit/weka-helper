Amazon vs Oracle: a database war
AWS announced several new products yesterday, including:

Aurora is now the fifth database engine in the AWS RDS service that includes MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. The company says
Amazon Aurora provides up to five times better performance than MySQL at a price point one tenth that of a commercial database while delivering similar performance and availability.
Anurag Gupta, GM of Amazon Aurora, said the product broke with the monolithic mainframe model of relational databases because it was architected using existing AWS services such as S3 storage, EC2 and VPC. Like other built-for-the-cloud products, Aurora incorporates a service-oriented, and decoupled, architecture.
Aurora is multi-tenant, scale out and self-managed. But the key issue AWS stressed is the enterprise-class performance and availability of Aurora:
The cost, on an r3.large EC2 instance — which sports two virtual CPUs running on 15.25GiB of RAM with 32GB of storage — is $0.29 per hour.
If it wasn't already obvious, AWS intends to make running your own data center as quaint as generating your own electricity. With the advent of Aurora, AWS is knocking on the datacenter's door, asking to host the most business-critical apps.
In his speech, Andy Jassy, SVP of AWS, specifically called out the "expensive and punitive" licensing model of major database vendors. With pay-as-you-go pricing, Aurora offers a stark and refreshing change.
The pricing is going to force IT to seriously consider what AWS offers. Giving up some bells and whistles for 1/10th the cost makes any CFO's heart glad.
Just as AWS has taken the wind out of the enterprise storage market, database vendors face a challenge to maintain their market share and gross margins. Oracle is the richest target, but they are only collateral damage in AWS's grand ambition to remake IT.
Comments welcome, as always.
