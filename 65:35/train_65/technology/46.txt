Motorola Moto E 4G LTE teardown reveals major design changes

While last year's Moto E failed to impress in the specs department, its price was hard to beat. This year, Motorola is back with another version of its budget-priced Android handset, the Moto E 4G LTE--and not only does the new phone have better hardware, but a brand new design both inside and out.
Compared to the original Moto E, the Moto E 4G LTE's hardware is a definite step up. Its 4.5-inch display looks good, but it's not 1080p. It has a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor and Adreno 306 GPU, 8GB of internal storage, 1GB of RAM, a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera, a 2,390mAh battery, and 4G LTE connectivity. It also ships with Android Lollipop 5.0.2.

Those specs aren't stellar compared to most high-end, flagship phones, but given the Moto E's $150 dollar US price, the phone's still a good value.

From a teardown standpoint, the Moto E 4G LTE is a mixed bag. On the downside, there's its glued-on front panel, plethora of internal screws, and soldered-on components. On the plus side, once you're inside the phone, removing the internal hardware is relatively easy and all the screws are at least the same size.
The same can be said of the handset overall. Its specs can't compete with high-end phones, but given its price, the Moto E can be a good value. As Dolcourt and Westaway wrote in their review, the second generation Moto E "could be a solid choice for first-time smartphone shoppers or those looking to pick up a new mobile without breaking the bank."
