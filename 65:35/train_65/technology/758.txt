Apple has all the tech pieces in place to build a MacBook tablet

What do you get if you take Apple's new MacBook, pry out the keyboard and duct tape the display to the body? An OS X-powered MacBook tablet, that's what.
OK, I'm sure Apple would do things a little more elegantly than that, but the innovation crammed inside Apple's newest MacBook looks eerily similar to that of a tablet.
Look at what the new MacBook brings to the table. A super-thin 12-inch retina-display panel, a tiny logic board featuring a fanless Intel Core M "Broadwell" processor drawing only 5 watts, terraced batteries that allows every nook and cranny to be filled with power, and a single USB-C port that handles power and connectivity.
Even the 29W USB-C power adapter is not much bigger than the one for the iPad. And it features a detachable cord.
Just remove the physical keyboard and add a touchscreen display and "BOOM!" you have a tablet. Given that there would be no need for a trackpad on the tablet, there's even more room inside for batteries, or just leave it filled with air to keep the weight down.
Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that this tablet would be about 9mm at its thickest point and weigh in at around 700g (Apple would save on the weight of the keyboard, hinges, trackpad, screws and a fair bit of aluminum).
"What about the keyboard?" I hear you ask. No problems. OS X has a built-in on-screen keyboard ready to use. Want to add more ports? There's a dongle for that!
Sure, OS X would need some work to make it touch-ready, but Apple has ben working towards making OS X look and feel - and work - more like iOS during recent years.
The more I look at the new MacBook, the more it feels to me like it has been designed in such a way that the process could be applied to making an OS X tablet. The power and the battery life it would offer would make it a killer device for BYOD and enterprise.
The new MacBook is the closest thing to a full-blown OS X tablet that Apple has built, and it would be strange of the company not to make the final leap.
And it would come in silver, space gray, and gold, so there's a finish to suit all!
