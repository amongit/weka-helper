Dropbox adds killer productivity feature to iOS app | ZDNet
If you're a Dropbox user who owns an iPhone or iPad, then your life is about to get a lot more productive.The latest update to the Dropbox app for iOS adds the ability to save files directly to your Dropbox storage from the apps that you use through an Action Extension. And it's simple to use... just tap the Share button from any app that displays it - for example the Photos app - and then hit Save to Dropbox. And you're done. If you don't see the option to save to Dropbox then you can enable it by tapping on the Share button, tapping More and enabling the Dropbox action. You can also change the order the actions to suit. I'm already using my Dropbox account a lot more now. I can focus my workflow more by doing more through Dropbox and relying less on silly hacks like emailing documents to myself. Also, by using cloud storage, I'm reducing on the number of clones I'm making of a document, which helps prevent versioning issues.See also:
