Amazon Web Services nabs Internet of Things developer platform 2lemetry
Amazon Web Services is quietly stacking the deck for its own Internet of Things strategy with the acquisition of developer platform 2lemetry.
Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure top cloud dev choices, says survey
"We can confirm that Amazon has acquired 2lemetry, and we look forward to continuing to support 2lemetry customers," said an Amazon spokesperson to ZDNet on Thursday.
Founded in 2011, 2lemetry developed what its touts as an "IoT version" of Enterprise Application Integration middleware, focusing on development for connected devices at scale.
Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
An Internet of Things-esque game plan is all but required of cloud and networking tech companies these days.
AWS has been a few steps ahead of most wide-scale cloud providers, but competitors are quickly gaining with routine price cuts and continuously rolling out new features of their own.
Google Cloud Platform is one of those competitors putting the most pressure on Amazon, recently debuting a new on-demand cloud storage option with near limitless room for data at an extremely low rate.
Nevertheless, AWS has been keeping up the pace.
In January, the Seattle-headquartered company introduced a bevy of new features, including the ability to access the management console across different accounts as well as some enhancements to GovCloud in the United States.
AWS CTO Werner Vogels told India's Businessworld at the time that the strategy for staying ahead of the game rests on Amazon's high-volumes and low margins -- the latter of which he suggested is something where the competition struggles.
