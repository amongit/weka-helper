50 resources for using tech in the modern classroom
The aim of technology may be to make processes more efficient and to expand our horizons, but unless used appropriately, it can also make life unnecessarily complicated. In the classroom, teachers are more and more often expected to show innovative and progressive thinking by integrating technological solutions into their lessons — but starting out isn't easy. From learning how to scour YouTube for clips to working out which photos and files can be used under fair copyright terms, while trying to keep up with standard workloads, invigorating lessons with technology can fall by the wayside.
To help teachers out, and given the popularity of ZDNet's last iPad in the classroom roundup, here is an updated, fresh list of tutorials, apps and software to transform your work-life balance and the student experience in today's modern classroom.
