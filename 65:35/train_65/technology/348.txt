​LinkedIn surpasses 20 million users in Brazil
LinkedIn has reported that more than 20 million Brazilians are now active users of its professional social networking platform. This means Brazil remains the third largest market for the company, after the United States and India.
According to the company, LinkedIn's user base in Brazil has also become a lot more diverse in terms of sector representation: the platform has moved on from being mostly favored by IT and telecoms professionals to having education, marketing, HR, finance, wellbeing and construction as other significant sectors.
Since launching in Brazil in 2010, LinkedIn ended 2012 with 10 million users in Brazil. The local user base grew to 15 million people by the end of 2013. The platform has around 347 million users worldwide.
LinkedIn's Latin America business was managed out of Canada until late 2011, when it commenced local operations, with the appointment of ex-Microsoft Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira as country manager. Canadian staff from areas such as communications and PR also helped getting the company started in São Paulo and hired local professionals.
The Brazil staff consists mostly of sales-focused professionals working on LinkedIn's main products, Marketing Solutions and Talent Solutions. The former products are information services to B2C and B2B clients, who can target certain niche areas according to criteria such as age, location and job seniority. The talent offerings are focused on HR clients and include services such as tools that help companies keep track of interactions with potential recruits.
