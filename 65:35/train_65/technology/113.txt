Taiwan IT month to highlight wearable electronic devices
Taiwan's "102 IT Month" electronics fair, to be launched on November 30, will highlight technologies involving healthcare and smart, wearable electronic devices, such as smart watches, according to the state-run Central News Agency (CNA).
The large, free-admission consumer electronics fair will be held island-wide in four cities. In Taipei, 1,765 stalls run by 350 companies will be gathered at the World Trade Center for the event ending on December 8. The event's organizer, the Taipei Computer Association, said that in Taipei, the fair is expected to attract 910,000 visitors.
Google Maps, Offers and the big wearable technology picture
Google Maps is getting a coupons and deals infusion in a move that will become increasingly handy as wearable technology accelerates.
According to the association, the fair will display innovative wearable electronic devices designed for healthcare. For example, a smart watch can sense abnormalities of the user's heart rate and notify family members through GPS base stations or Wi-Fi networks. Other fitness-focused smart watches feature Bluetooth connectivity, built-in GPS tracking, a pulse-based heart rate monitor, and others. Visitors will have opportunities to try on different wearable devices on the scene.
New technologies can also be observed in an invention of a sound-sensitive baby crib, designed to lower the risk of sudden unexpected infant deaths. The innovative device is capable of tracking an infant's breathing patterns and sending signals to its parents' smartphones, CNA reported.
In addition to the smart, wearable devices , the exhibition includes other sections themed on smart, handheld devices, near-field communication (NFC) mobile applications, and sensor/control products.
The Taipei exhibit will be followed by similar ones in Taichung in central Taiwan in mid-December, and in Kaohsiung and Tainan in southern Taiwan from late December to early January.
Some vendors of notebooks, smartphones, and tablets also take advantage of the fair to increase sale opportunities. According to Taiwan's Asustek Computer Inc, it expects its notebook computer unit sales to grow 20 percent year on year at the fair, according to CNA.
