HP lands network virtualization deal with Telefonica | ZDNet
Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday said that it has landed a systems and networking integration pact with Telefonica.The win is welcome news for HP, which said last week that its networking unit struggled in the company's fiscal first quarter. HP cited execution issues in China and the U.S.Under the Telefonica deal, the company will use HP's OpenNFV platform, which includes server, software, orchestration and networking technology as well as hooks into the HP Helion OpenStack service. NFV, or network functions virtualization, is a technology that's supposed to allow carriers to better provision services on the fly. Telefonica is looking to move from its proprietary architecture to a virtualization powered one called UNICA. Telefonica will also use HP's software defined networking tools. According to Telefonica, the company is looking to virtualize non-critical systems, move to virtual core networking technology and then use virtualization for home subscriber servers and other critical applications. The stack Telefonica is rolling out includes HP's converged infrastructure, Helion CloudSystem, NFV Director, Helion OpenStack and distributed cloud networking. HP said there's also a consulting and services component to the deal.
