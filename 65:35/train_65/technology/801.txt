2014 Christmas gift guide: Smartphone accessories for photographers
| Image 1 of 10

The pocket spotlight is a handy gadget and gift for those who want to improve their mobile device's flash capabilities. Mounted through a smartphone's headphone jack, the device creates a continuous, soft source of light.
Price: $30
Purchase: Photojojo

Lensbaby's LM 10 Sweet Spot lens is a fun and somewhat inexpensive smartphone camera accessory. The mount snaps on easily to a smartphone, and through an accompanying app, you can focus your image with a "sweet spot" focus surrounded by blur — an interesting effect for your photos.
Price: $69.95
Purchase: Lensbaby

Fujifilm Instax Share SP-1 is a useful accompaniment for any smartphone photographer who enjoys snapping on-the-go. The tiny printer connects up to your smartphone and can be used to print out snaps, as well as share photos on social media.
Price: £139 ($217)
Purchase: Amazon

The Kogeto Dot is another interesting accessory, but this lens focuses on real-time capture of panoramic images. Using an app, you can swipe and drag to swivel the lens 360 degrees — far beyond the capabilities of standard smartphone cameras.
Price: $39
Purchase: Kogeto

Autographer is for smartphone photography enthusiasts who would like to capture the same images in a different way through separate devices. The wearable system, equipped with five sensors, intelligently shoots at what the creators call "just the right times" — and takes wide-angle shots that can be downloaded at the end of the day for viewing and editing. Take the same image with a smartphone and compare the differences.
Price: $399
Purchase: Autographer

Motrr Galileo is a tablet holder with a rotating base that grips your iPhone in order to tilt it at any angle, and has a tripod mount in the bottom. The product can be used to move your camera into the perfect position, while you can use an accompanying app to shoot time-lapses or panoramas, create interactive spherical images or use your camera for a number of other tasks, such as surveillance.
Price: $99.95 - $149.95
Purchase: Motrr

The Photojojo iPhone and Android lens series is a great gift for smartphone photography enthusiasts who enjoy variety in their mobile device shoots. A small, stick-on magnetic ring goes around the camera's lens, which then allows individual Photojojo lenses to magnetically clip on. The lenses feel like quality due to the metal finish — although the stick-on rings do have a habit of peeling off eventually — and the lens effects are interesting, especially when using the FishEye model. Currently, you can purchase telephoto, FishEye and Wide/Macro varieties.
Price: $20 - $99
Purchase: Photojojo

Most mobile projector systems are expensive investments — but why not convert your smartphone into a makeshift projector? Using Luckies' Smartphone Projector, you can slot your smartphone into the product's gap, and then a glass lens reflects images onto a wall. However, as a budget item this is not suitable for professional use; it's more of a novelty gift for smartphone users.
Price: £15.95 ($25)
Purchase: Notonthehighstreet

Viddy is a do-it-yourself pinhole camera kit made of card. While not strictly a smartphone accessory, the kit can give a photographer more ideas when it comes to microphotography.
Price: £38 ($60)
Purchase: Thepopupinholecompany

The Joby GorillaPod is a flexible, fun tripod that makes a great smartphone camera accessory and gift. Magnetized, the tripod will cling to many different surfaces, and can be twisted and pulled to allow your smartphone to capture the perfect image at just the right angle. The GorillaPod works with a variety of different smartphone models including the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy range.
Price: $20+
Purchase: Joby | Amazon

The pocket spotlight is a handy gadget and gift for those who want to improve their mobile device's flash capabilities. Mounted through a smartphone's headphone jack, the device creates a continuous, soft source of light.
