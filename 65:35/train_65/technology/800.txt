Combining art with just a touch of geekery, the metal art mech warrior phone stand is the perfect place to stash your smartphone on a desk or the coffee table. Nuts, bolts and chains sourced from junk yards and fused together form the figure. However, due to the nature of the stand, only certain smartphones that are a maximum of 7.4cm in width and 1.3cm in depth — such as the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S4 — are compatible.
Price:£49.95 ($78)
Purchase: Red5

For something a little different but still smart, Ringly offers a variety of rings that connect to smartphones via Bluetooth in order to notify you of calls, texts, emails and notifications — without the wearer needing to check their phone.
Price: $195 - $260
Purchase: Ringly

Cute and functional, this Mushroom LED lamp not only works as a standard light source, but also connects via Bluetooth to mobile devices or PCs so you can use the lamp's speakers to listen to music.
