Google's Android Lollipop update improves the Samsung Galaxy S5 look and functionality
| Image 1 of 7

Android manufacturers are doing a better job at updating older devices, as seen with the recent HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 releases. I was very curious to see how Samsung's implementation of Lollipop would work with its TouchWiz UI so I updated my wife's S5 last week and took it for a spin.
As you can see in the next six screenshots, Samsung did a nice job with the Lollipop update. Material Design is integrated throughout the Galaxy S5 while all of the Samsung extras are still fully supported. My wife is impressed with the look, feel, and performance of her updated S5 so far.
I think Galaxy S5 owners will appreciate the fresh look of their one year old phone. I haven't heard of any major issues with the update so when your carrier releases it you should consider the update.

The flip carousel replaces the card view from TouchWiz. I personally find the Lollipop implementation much better and faster than the TouchWiz design.

Notifications on the lock screen now have the standard Lollipop look and functionality.

The new Samsung messaging app looks very similar to the Google Messenger app, but still maintains the slick Samsung most recent bar for quick access to your favorite people.

The notifications drop down has improved fonts and the Lollipop notifications, but still maintains the Samsung TouchWiz quick controls.

The settings on the Galaxy S5 have slightly different fonts and colors, but the same overwhelming number of settings are present.

The phone dialer has a Material Design look and feel where white backgrounds are used more often than the black ones you may be used to.
