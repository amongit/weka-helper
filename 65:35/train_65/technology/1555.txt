Tips: How the iPhone 6 Plus and Android phones can do real work | ZDNet
Tablets do a nice job standing in for laptops at work, especially when paired with a good keyboard. What some don't realize is the same is true for smartphones with a large display. The biggest iPhone is particularly good for occasional work tasks if you do it right. Having long used an iPad for work, I was surprised to find how good the iPhone 6 Plus could handle many common work functions. I stumbled on this by accident one day when I didn't have the iPad with me and needed to do something quickly. This successful work session on the iPhone led to many others. The advantage the phone has over other types of mobile devices is that the phone is always with you. This is reason enough to give some thought to using it for work, and with a little preparation it can be a full work system. Many put a case on the iPhone for protection. These come in various types, and cases with a kickstand are especially good for work. These have some type of kickstand that pops out of the back of the case that props the iPhone up at a convenient angle for using the phone hands-free. See related: i-Blason Transformer review I use one from i-Blason, but any case will work. It is important to make sure the kickstand will let the iPhone 6 Plus be used in either landscape or portrait orientation. Some apps may not work in landscape, so the phone must be used in portrait with those. Tip: The iPhone 6 Plus is useful when used in landscape, but if display settings have been set to zoomed the home screen won't rotate. Go to Settings | Display | View and set it to normal. The phone will reboot and screen rotation will be re-enabled. Using the iPhone 6 Plus for work can easily be done in the hand, but for times when a lot of text entry is required using a physical keyboard is the way to go. Using a keyboard is not only more efficient, it avoids those embarrassing auto-correct snafus. The last thing you want when writing a detailed email to a client is letting an inappropriate auto-correction get past you. There are good mobile keyboards that can be used with the iPhone 6 Plus that can be thrown in a pocket in a briefcase and then forgotten until needed. I have been using the Logitech Keys-To-Go for months and it is a good solution when paired with the iPhone. It works with Android phones, too. See related: Logitech Keys-To-Go review on ZDNet I am currently testing a portable keyboard that I will be reviewing shortly that is even more portable than the Logitech and is a good option for using with the iPhone and Android phones. The integrated stand in this keyboard eliminates the need for a kickstand case.
