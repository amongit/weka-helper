Bafta host wants more recognition for games in UK
Rufus Hound has told Newsbeat politicians need to do more to champion the UK gaming industry.
Speaking ahead of the British Academy Games Awards, which he is hosting for the first time, he said he rarely hears "anything positive".
The comedian suggested politicians are too keen to please older people and criticise games.
"The Queen should be walking around with a PS Vita dangling out of her back pocket," he added.
Rufus Hound is taking over from comedian Dara O'Brien as host for the 2015 ceremony, at which Alien: Isolation leads the nominations this year.
The comedian, who has been heavily involved with the National Health Action (NHA) party in the past, criticised politicians for their approach to the UK gaming industry.
"I don't think I've ever heard them say anything positive about it outside of, 'well it might improve hand eye co-ordination'," he said.
"The problem with our modern political system is that it's mainly aimed at pleasing old people, old people are far more likely to vote than young people.
"What that means is when they see Grand Theft Auto, they don't say, 'Oh I see this this is a funny take on the overblown, hyper violent world of action movies'.
"So the people who have to pander to those people say, it's a 'bloody outrage, look you can hit a prostitute.'"
"Nobody is saying go out and hit prostitutes... but politicians can't say, 'no, this is a phenomenal new way of having fun with your brain.'
"'Getting to pretend to have all these incredible experiences and solve puzzles and things like that.'
"The nearest you'll get politicians saying that gaming is good, is like brain training on the DS because it's basically maths homework and that's what old people think young people should be doing all the time."
"I've played video games with people in their 60s and 70s who love video games so it's absolutely not true about all people, but it is true in terms of how politicians represent the video games industry."
Rufus Hound praised Bafta's recognition of games as a form of entertainment.
"What I like about Bafta is that it respects the craft of story telling, when it's told technologically."
Speaking to us at Bafta HQ in central London he said; "Largely these things are a marketing exercise but what the British Academy seems to be able to do is genuinely hail people who get it right.
"It does seem to exist in a far less political way than some of the others (award ceremonies)."
The awards take place on Thursday at Tobacco Dock in London.
A total of 51 games have been nominated across 17 categories.
