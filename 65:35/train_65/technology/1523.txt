Vic Police awards AU$164m IT services contract | ZDNet
Australian company Kinetic IT has been awarded an AU$164 million contract to provide IT services to Victoria Police.The contract details were published by Victoria Police this week, and see the company take over from global IT giants IBM and Fujitsu as the key IT supplier for the police.According to the contract documents, Kinetic IT will supply service desk operations and end-user services including workstations, mobiles, internet and email services, and network services.Kinetic IT will also be responsible for datacentre hosting services and disaster recovery, as well as IT management and security.The company will need to support the legacy systems, including the replacement of the decades-old Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP), Victoria Police's record management system.The agency was given AU$23.3 million in the 2013 Budget to replace LEAP over five years. Victoria Police originally attempted to replace the system in 2005 at a cost of AU$59 million, but this was ultimately found to be a gross underestimation of the cost and complexity of replacing the system. "LEAP operates on obsolete mainframe and 'green screen' technology," a report by then-chief commissioner Ken Lay stated last year.The LEAP system has been the subject of criticism following many "high-profile lapses of information security", according to Lay. The problem with accessing warrants in the LEAP system for up to two weeks after they have been issued was in part blamed for the death of 11-year-old Luke Batty last year at the hands of his father.The report also revealed that Victoria Police was not due to migrate off Windows XP until the end of 2014, and that the legacy technology had forced some officers to take work home. "Many police encounter difficulty in opening documents created using newer programs and resort to taking the documents home to read, print, or convert to a usable format," Lay said.According to the Kinetic IT contract details, there are 14,000 desktops running Windows, laptops, and tablets in Victoria Police, along with 1,000 mobile devices. The network is a MPLS WAN provided by Telstra.Victoria Police has one datacentre in the Melbourne CBD, and disaster recovery in a Melbourne suburb.
