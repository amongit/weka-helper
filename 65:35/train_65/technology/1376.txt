Apple's new MacBook puts a $79 price tag on USB ports | ZDNet
Notebooks usually come with a few USB ports and such for you to hook up devices to, but adding a single USB port to Apple's new MacBook will set you back $79.Before they were stars: Smartwatches in pop cultureFrom the stone ages of the Flintstones to the futuristic sky cities of the Jetsons, the smartwatch has been a surprising yet underlying constant in pop culture.Apple has done away with the myriad of power, USB, and Thunderbolt ports present on the MacBook air and replaced them with a single USB-C port. While this has allowed the designers at Cupertino to make the new MacBook thinner, it also means that there's only one port for power and connectivity.That single USB-C port offers support for charging, USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps), native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA output and HDMI - as long as you can make it compatible.Fear not, because Apple will sell you dongles that will add a USB port, a pass-through USB-C, and your choice of VGA or HDMI.And each dongle will set you back $79 each.UPDATE: Apple has added a USB-C to USB adapter to the lineup of ongles, this one more reasonably priced at $19. However, this does not allow you to charge the device and use a USB device. For that you'll need one of the $79 dongles.That's a hefty premium for a couple of ports. If you don't need to connect anything to your new MacBook - or charge anything using a USB port - then you can save yourself the money. However, my guess is that a lot of people will find themselves in need of a USB port every once in a while, and that dongle will come in handy.But it's an expensive dongle, one that costs more than the Apple TV set-top box. | Image 1 of 16 Apple has finally released its newest product line – the Apple Watch. This, the company claims, it its most personal device to date. Let's take a look at what this new product has to offer.See also:The Apple Watch comes in three different varieties:Comes in two sizes:Comes in two sizes:Priced from $10K rising to a whopping $17,000 depending on the band, the Apple Watch Edition will be available from selected outlets.The aluminum used to make Apple Watch Sport is 60 percent stronger than standard alloys, while the stainless steel used to make the cases is up to 80 percent harder through a specialized cold-forging process.Apple is saying that the Apple Watch has an 18-hour battery life, which means nightly charging using the snap-on inductive charger.No word on how much real-world usage users can expect from the device.The Apple Watch will be available for pre-order and preview from April 10 in the following territories, with the product starting to ship April 24:The Apple Watch is not a standalone device, and needs an iPhone to work its magic. In fact, it offloads much of the hard work onto the iPhone in order to extend battery life.The Apple Watch will feature a highly-customizable face, allowing it to display a wide range of information.The Apple Watch puts a lot of emphasis on health and fitness, with motion trackers that monitor your movements and a heartrate monitor to keep an eye on that side of things.... all from your wrist!
