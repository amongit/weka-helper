Salesforce adds more intelligence, data science to Service Cloud | ZDNet
Salesforce on Monday launched what it calls an "intelligence engine" for its Service Cloud that aims to meld data science, customer service and more connected devices.The argument from Salesforce is that data science and smart customer service will matter more as more devices are connected to the Internet. As the Internet of things snowballs, the expectations for rapid fire customer service will increase. The key parts of the Service Cloud Intelligence engine include:What Salesforce is trying to do is prepare for more channels and devices being used for customer support and experiences. "I see these devices being customer support points," said Sarah Patterson, vice president of Service Cloud product marketing. Some of these tickets could start as automated cases from a connected point such as a car and then switch to another channel such as email, live chat or voice.The engine is built on Salesforce algorithms with custom rules available for enterprises. Salesforce said it has "a number of customers" in pilots.Here's a look at a few screen shots. The Service Cloud Intelligence Engine will be available later in 2015 with pricing to be announced then. The intelligence engine will be an add-on to the Service Cloud, which starts at $135 per user per month.
