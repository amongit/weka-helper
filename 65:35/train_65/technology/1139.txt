HP refreshes tablet lineup, publishes new enterprise mobility research
HP has announced seven new tablets and an ultrabook/tablet hybrid, and also released new research on European IT decision-makers' current and planned enterprise mobility strategies. We recently caught up with Michael Park, vice president & general manager of HP's Commercial Mobility & Software business unit, to get the details on the products and hear HP's current thinking on enterprise mobility.

Front and centre is HP's determination to add software and services to the basic device offering. "When we talk about mobility in the enterprise, if you just do the device, it's not enough: it's the apps and the device for the end user, but also connectivity -- how to deliver the apps out of the data center -- and the scale of the sheer number of devices per user," says Park.
"There's a lot of complexity in implementing commercial mobility," adds Park, "and we have to think about how all those pieces come together, which requires a different kind of thinking about how we design the products and the corresponding services."
One of those services is HP Touchpoint Manager, a cloud-based MDM (mobile device management) solution aimed at SMEs, which was announced in December 2014. Offering a browser-based 'single pane of glass' view of device inventory and health, remote lock and wipe, automatic application of security and policy settings, proactive alerts to IT admins, plus password and PIN resets, Touchpoint Manager currently supports iOS, Android and Windows devices, with Mac OS support on the way, according to Park. The service is vendor-agnostic, but HP devices offer extra insight into hardware health, warranty information and (for some models) out-of-band find, lock and wipe.

Higher up the food chain, HP offers integration into existing EMM (enterprise mobility management) solutions rather than adding an enterprise version of Touchpoint Manager to an already crowded marketplace. Application migration and app development services are also part of HP's enterprise mobility offering.
Summing up the CIO's BYOD dilemma, Michael Park says: "You can't just bring a consumer device into an enterprise and say 'we're done': this is about app transformation, optimising the workflow, how you deal with policies and so on."
To gauge how IT decision-makers are currently thinking about BYOD and enterprise mobility, HP commissioned a study of 1,130 IT decision makers across eight European countries in July 2014. Headline findings include the fact that, despite the rise of new mobile form factors like tablets, hybrids, phablets and smartphones, traditional desktops and notebooks are expected to hold their own -- at least until 2020:

Security emerged as the biggest concern around BYOD in the enterprise, with 20 percent of companies surveyed that have a BYOD policy in place reporting at least one security breach in the last year. Respondents flagged up a range of security concerns surrounding BYOD, headed by malware infection of the company network:
