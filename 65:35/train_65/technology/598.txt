Drones still useful in supply chains despite FAA regulations
Last week the Federal Aviation Administration published its rules and regulations for the oversight of drone usage within the United States. Many will and have argued that these rules are too restrictive for companies such as Amazon or Google to truly take advantage of the technology. The basic parameters of the guidelines set by the FAA:
On the surface these restrictions severely limit the dreams of the likes of Jeff Bezos. One of the great opportunities for drones within the supply chain and particularly with the delivery side is the ability to enhance the last mile portion. The last mile is always a challenge since you have to break down the orders to the individual level. Drones seem to offer an affordable and flexible solution - but not if the FAA rules are in place. This does not mean there are not some use cases that supply chains can take advantage of immediately:
These use cases are not necessarily replicable under the FAA rules. However I have to believe that as the technology continues to evolve the FAA will loosen its regulatory grip. So what could we expect from more open drone rules? If and when the drone rules become more open here are some opportunities that supply chains might enjoy:
I realize these changes are a ways off. But these are examples of how the supply chain will be expanded beyond the traditional links - loading dock, retail store to name a few. These types of digital disruptions will begin to turn our homes into an extension of our supply chains.
Now I wonder where I should build my drone landing pad...
