CliQr launches cloud marketplace featuring 100 open source apps
Google-backed CliQr Technologies, which focuses on helping businesses migrate applications into private or public cloud environments, has flipped the switch on the CliQr App Store, a collection of more than 100 popular open source applications.
Its aim is to provide businesses with a single place where they can easily provision these applications on private cloud infrastructure using VMware, OpenStack and CloudStack or on public cloud services including Amazon Web Services, Cloud N, Dimension Data, Google Cloud Platform, HP Public Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
Some of the software included within the marketplace include apps from Alfresco, Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, Blender, SugarCRM, FreeCAD, Dolibarr, Test Link, OSClass, Subversion, Omero, Cyrp, Piwik and concrete5.
CliQr is touting both the one-click deployment offered by its app store along with management, metering and billing capabilities that help IT organizations manage diverse and complex cloud service portfolios. "Other migration tools have taken the approach of requiring apps to conform to very diverse private and public clouds," said Gaurav Manglik, co-founder and CEO of CliQr. "History has shown us this approach simply won't scale."
The company's flagship technology, CloudCenter, is a management platform for streamlining application deployment and management across multiple cloud environments.
CliQr is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and its backers include Google Ventures, Foundation Capital and TransLink Capital.
