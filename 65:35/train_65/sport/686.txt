England defeated France 55-35 in a dramatic game at Twickenham to conclude their Six Nations, but failed to win the championship, needing another six points for ultimate victory.
Ending an incredible day, during which both Ireland and Wales – England's rivals for the crown – achieved away successes over Scotland and Italy away respectively, Stuart Lancaster's side required a winning margin of 26 points.
England scrum-half Ben Youngs ensured a brilliant start for the Twickenham crowd, scoring after only two minutes. The try came about when the French midfield was put under pressure following their scrum. The ball was turned over and Jonathan Joseph was able to find Mike Brown on the right. The full-back played in George Ford, who was scragged just before the French line and was able to slip it to a jubilant Youngs.
Ford was able to nail the conversion though the fly-half failed with a penalty shot three minutes later. His opposite man, Jules Plisson, laced a three-pointer, and shortly afterwards the visitors went in front with a breakaway try through Sébastien Tillous-Borde.

England v France: Key Influencer?
A Courtney Lawes mistake allowed the French No9 to run in a try in the left-hand corner from long range and take his side ahead 8-7.
Amazingly Les Bleus extended their lead thanks to a first international try from left winger Noa Nakaitaci. The Fijian-born pace man needed a positive verdict from the TMO after it appeared he had run out of space behind the tryline.
A Ford penalty clawed back another three points for England before Anthony Watson dotted down on the right to take the hosts ahead again at 17-15, with his Bath teammate and No10 Ford converting.
Youngs used quick thinking, following Brown’s tap penalty, to cross under the sticks to make it 24-15, with Ford added the extras. And the stand-off kicked another penalty to end an extraordinary half.
After the break the drama continued, with Maxime Memoz's converted try making it 27-22, before Ford scored himself. Jack Nowell crossed twice, and Billy Vunipola also bundled over, but France hit back through Vincent Debaty and Benjamyn Kayser.
James Haskell was sin binned for stupidly tripping Jules Plissen when the score was 41-25, and that lack of discipline cost England dearly.
According to TryTracker the hosts hit two of their three targets – beating 22 defenders (17 was their aim) and clocking up 10 shots at the posts (of which Ford aced nine, while six was the recommended minimum). The only Key to the Game they failed to manage was 91 per cent of tackles. Their 86 per cent showed an areas where Lancaster's team let themselves slip.
For France they hit one of their three Keys to the Game: 16 out of 16 turnovers. Their percentage success rate at goal (44) was woefully below their recommended rate of 76.7. And they scored a 71.4 per cent winning rate on their own scrum, surprisingly. Ninety was their aim.
In terms of Key Influencers Youngs was the star man, crossing twice and running 90 metres with the ball. For France Noa Nakaitaci ran 181 metres, while there were many other stand-out showings in a game which boasted 90 points and 12 tries in total.
