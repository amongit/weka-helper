What do you give the man who has everything? How do you improve the career of someone who has won 17 Grand Slams? You give them the Davis Cup of course.
By winning Tennis's premier team competition with Switzerland, Roger Federer claimed the one major trophy to have eluded him in his illustrious career.
In celebration of the Swiss player's historic achievement, Telegraph Sport has taken a look at the staggering numbers that have defined Federer's journey to sporting immortality.
As well as those 17 Grand Slam successes, Federer has won a total of 996 matches, picked up Â£34.5 million in prize money and finished the year as world No 1 on five seperate occasions.
And what's more, he shows no signs of letting up in his bid to add more trophies to his bulging cabinet.
