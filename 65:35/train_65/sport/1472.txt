Hull KR prop Mitch Allgood has been banned for two matches after being found guilty of Grade C striking in the win over Catalans Dragons.
The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to striking Scott Dureau in the first half of his side's 50-20 win on Sunday.
Dragons forward Ben Pomeroy has been given a one-match ban after being found guilty of Grade B running in and striking in the same match.
Meanwhile, the Robins have released hooker Keal Carlile by mutual consent.
The 24-year-old joined the Robins from Huddersfield Giants in 2011 and made 36 appearances for the club, scoring one try.
He told the club website: "I was out of contract at the end of the season and I didn't want to be sat in the stands.
"I've got a young family to think about and although everything has happened so fast, the time felt right to move onto the next chapter in my career."
