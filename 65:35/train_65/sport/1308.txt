Ian Poulter eyes world No 2 spot after Rory McIlroy wins Race To Dubai ahead of DP World Tour Championship

Rory McIlroy has already scooped the ­jackpot, but there is still so many bonus balls on offer here at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship.
Not least for Tommy Fleetwood. The Englishman, 23, is not the most obvious headline-grabber, what with his compatriot Ian Poulter promising, in true “Postman” style, to deliver his first title of the season and so grab second place in the Race to Dubai and climax his European Tour season with a $2 million (£1.6 million) windfall. But the prize in Fleetwood’s eyes is beyond a price.
At 61st in the world, the young Merseysider needs to jump 11 places by the end of the year to earn a dream place at next year’s Masters. Second place here in the DP World Tour Championship would do it and allow Fleetwood the comfort of an enjoyable run-up to Christmas. Otherwise, he will be traversing the globe in his pursuit of his debut in the season’s first major.
“I went to Augusta this year just to watch and was enthralled by the place,” Fleetwood said. “I said to my manager Chubby [Chandler], ‘I can’t wait to come here as a player’, and although I’m young and have to stay patient there is an obvious opportunity in the next month or so.”
Chandler, who oversees some of golf’s biggest names such as Lee Westwood, estimates that Fleetwood will need about 38 ranking points in the next six weeks to realise his ambition. The Southport product is almost assured of his second appearance in the Open as he is 22nd in the Race to Dubai standings and the top 30 after Sunday’s conclusion will be rewarded with their St Andrews berth. Yet with six top-fives this campaign, after his maiden European Tour title at Glen­eagles last year, Fleetwood’s ambitions are understandably higher.

“I’ve been impressed with his professional approach,” Chandler said. “And since getting Phil Morbey on the bag [who used to caddie for Ian Woosnam and Darren Clarke] he has stepped up a level. There’s no rush, but I’m fairly certain that once he cracks that top 50 he’ll stay there for a long time. It would be great for him to do it here. But Tommy’s hopefully playing the Nedbank in Sun City and then in Thailand and back in Dubai before Christmas. He’s prepared to do whatever it takes and you have to admire that.”
In contrast, Poulter is thinking no further ahead than Sunday. Thanks to a sixth and a second in the past two weeks, he has jumped from 64th to 13th in the Race to Dubai standings. He knows that his first victory of the season could see him finish second in the order of merit for the second time in many years. “I feel good about what’s just happened in the last couple of weeks. Being 44 in the world rankings was nothing to be proud of but moving up to 26 and hopefully with a big win this week I can put myself back in a position where I salvage something out of 2014, because it was not looking good.”
If he does so then he will have to thank Greg Norman. After Poulter had missed a six-footer on the final hole at last week’s Turkish Airlines Open to force a play-off with Brooks Koepka, the Australian texted Poulter to say he had a tip for his putting. Poulter has spoken to Norman, but would not reveal the advice.
