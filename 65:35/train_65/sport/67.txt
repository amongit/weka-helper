Predators' Smith fined $5,000 for high sticking
NEW YORK (AP) -- Nashville Predators forward Craig Smith has been fined $5,000 for high-sticking Buffalo Sabres forward Jerry D'Amigo.
The incident occurred in the first period of the Predators' 3-0 victory Saturday and resulted in a four-minute penalty. D'Amigo took a high stick to the face that drew blood. D'Amigo sat out the entire second period and wore a full cage when he returned in the third period.
The $5,000 fine is the maximum allowable under the NHL's collective bargaining agreement with the NHL Players' Association. The money goes to the players' emergency assistance fund.
The NHL announced the punishment on Sunday.
