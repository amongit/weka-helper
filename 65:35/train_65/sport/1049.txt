Fabio Cannavaro, Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning captain, has been sentenced to 10 months in jail for breaking orders to keep out of his house after it was seized by authorities in Naples.
The former Parma, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid defender, who is now coach of Chinese league side Guangzhou Evergrande, has been under investigation for tax evasion.
Cannavaro's wife, Daniela Arenoso, and his brother Paolo, who plays in Serie A for Sassuolo, were also given custodial sentences. All three have appealed and have had their sentences suspended until a final judgment is made.

Prosecutors said the villa had been confiscated for suspected abuse of building regulations, involving failing to secure planning permission from the local council to carry out works to the house, the garden and pool.

The Cannavaro brothers and Arenoso were acquitted over the planning permission allegations, but convicted for breaking a police seal and entering a property illegally. In October, authorities in Naples seized almost £730,000 of goods linked to former world player of the year Cannavaro, 41, and his wife.
It has been reported that Cannavaro’s company Fd Service owes over £750,000 in unpaid taxes. The Italian Agency of Revenue has reportedly claimed that FD Service underpaid on Corporation Tax, Regional Tax and VAT between 2005-10.
According to an investigation led by prosecutor Luigi Cannavale, they went to the villa for a swim in the pool, ignoring the fact the property had been seized and they were banned from entering.
