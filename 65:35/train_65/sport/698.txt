German Grand Prix axed

Germany will have no Formula One grand prix this year for the first time since 1960 after the sport’s governing body issued a revised calendar on Friday without the July 19 round.
With Hockenheim and the Nurburgring unwilling to host the race, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) confirmed Germany had been dropped and there would now be 19 rounds with a three-week gap in July.
“The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the commercial rights holder and promoter did not reach agreement,” the FIA said.
The decision comes five days after the season started in Australia but had been expected, with both circuits making their positions clear, despite Germany being the home of world champions Mercedes.
The Nurburgring had been due to host the race under an alternation agreement with Hockenheim, who hosted it last year, but the circuit has changed ownership and baulked at paying the hosting fees.
Hockenheim, which has a contract for 2016, suffered poor attendances and substantial losses last season after only 52,000 people turned up on race day.
That circuit’s officials were approached by F1 commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone but made clear they were not willing to host the race three years in a row unless they received outside assistance.
The high price of tickets to cover the hosting fees, and the return of Austria to the calendar last year have been cited as contributory factors for the dwindling crowds.
