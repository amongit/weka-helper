London hosted the two-day test event at Greenwich Park and Crystal Palace on Saturday and Sunday, with Lena Schoneborn of Germany winning the women's event and Robert Kasza of Hungary finishing first in the men's.
The UIPM and the London organising committee (Locog) were at Greenwich Park to test equipment, technology and people and UIPM president Dr Klaus Schormann was a satisfied man come the end of the weekend.
"After two days of competition we are very satisfied with Greenwich Park and very impressed with Locog’s planning," said Dr Schormann.
"The park has provided a wonderful panorama for the men’s and women’s UIPM World Cup Finals and we are very happy to be here.
"It is a wonderful environment on ground that has proved good for jumping as well as providing a protective environment within which to compete. We are very happy with the event."

Locog has been criticised by a local pressure group for its use of Greenwich Park but organisers have been able to return large sections of Greenwich Park back to community use some three days ahead of schedule.
The boating pond is now back in use a week earlier than planned and work is under way to remove the temporary venue and return the park to its original state.
Graham Dear, park manager of Greenwich Park for The Royal Parks said he was confident that Locog would honour their commitment.
"Greenwich Park has provided a breathtaking setting for these test events and the atmosphere has been fantastic throughout," he said.
"We're now looking forward to hosting the equestrian and modern pentathlon events in 2012. The Royal Parks is really pleased with the progress that is being made to reinstate the park and almost 80 per cent of it is now open to the public.
"We're already ahead of schedule and we're confident that the park will recover very quickly."
