Chelsea transfer news: Atletico Madrid hope to take Filipe Luis back – if Jose Mourinho decides to offload defender

Filipe Luis could be offered a quick return to Atlético Madrid with the Spanish club monitoring his situation at Chelsea.
Left-back Luis joined Chelsea for £16 million from Atlético last summer, but has struggled to displace Cesar Azpilicueta in manager Jose Mourinho’s first-choice team.

Despite the fact Luis has made 22 appearances for Chelsea this season, Mourinho has stuck with Azpilicueta for his side’s biggest games and during the most vital periods of the season. Luis has only played 11 times in the Premier League.
Chelsea last month rejected stories from Spain that Luis is unhappy at the club, but it is understood Atlético are interested in taking the 29-year-old back to the Vicente Calderón Stadium.

Mourinho is looking to strengthen his defence in the summer, rather than further reduce his options, and may feel that Luis will improve following a season of adaptation in England and at Chelsea.
Atlético’s hopes of landing Luis, who won La Liga the Copa del Rey and the Europa League during four seasons at the club, may rest on whether or not the Brazilian tells Mourinho that he would like to return to Spain.
