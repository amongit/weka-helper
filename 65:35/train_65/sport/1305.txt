Rory McIlroy takes positives despite Henrik Stenson's triumph at DP World Tour Championship

Rory McIlroy promised the European Tour a grandstand finish to his remarkable, double-major- winning season and after a tremendous piece of luck with his drive on the 18th, it seemed he would deliver once again.
Alas, the Ulsterman’s three-iron to the green actually veered off into the grandstand and ultimately what he termed “a terrible shot” allowed Henrik Stenson a relatively comfortable walk up the climatic par-five to retain the DP World Tour Championship title. Still, after his 2014, McIlroy was not about to moan; indeed, anything but.
“I just didn't play well enough to win, and if I had won playing like that, it would have been a surprise,” he said. “And that’s a really big positive, not just going into next year, but going into the rest of my career.
“Because in seasons gone, by, a bad week for me would have resulted me finishing in the middle of the pack and not in contention like this week. That consistency in results is something I’ve been really pleased with this season. Yet all credit to Henrik. He deserved it.”
The Swede’s first victory of the year was rewarded with a $2.1m (£1.35m) payday, as the winner’s cheque ($1,333,300) came with the bonus of second place ($800,000) in the Race To Dubai. It was fitting that Stenson stood alongside McIlroy as the Ulsterman received his second order of merit trophy in three years. The pair are now Nos 1 and 2 in the world.

But for Stenson’s remarkable tee-shot to the par-three 17th, this was anything but a pretty finale. Yet what it lacked in golfing aesthetics it more than made up for in golfing dramatics. Justin Rose also pushed his second at the 18th into the stands and then, like McIlroy 10 minutes before, failed to get up and down for a birdie which could have proved all important.
In contrast, after he had conjured such a brilliant five-iron to six inches on the penultimate 195-yarder, Stenson merely had to make par to defend the title. He played it as three-shotter, but with the pressure off, span in his wedge into four feet. His 70 for a 16-under total was good enough to win by two - and successfully defend a title for the first time in his career - with France’s Victor Dubuisson joining his Ryder Cup team-mates in a tie for second.
“I’ve been close a couple of times this year, but eventually you get something if you stick around, and I surely did that today,” Stenson said.

McIlroy and Rose could console themselves with the thought that, as the desert breezes stiffened, they finished strongly to push the pacesetters. Thanks to Stenson’s double-bogey on the 11th - after he hooked his tee-shot into the water - and Rafael Cabrera-Bello’s lated capitulation, the pair were suddenly in with an alluring chance.
McIlroy birdied the 14th and 15th on the way to a 68 - meaning all 24 rounds to date on the Earth Course have been par or better - although the piece of fortune he received on the last should have seen him at least birdie that hole as well. His drive appeared destined for the stream which divides the 18th fairway. But it hit a rock and propelled a full 60 yards up the fairway.
Rose also birdied the 14th and 15th and then the 16th as well as he closed out his European Tour season with a 69. His drive on the last came up a few yards short of the stream, but he could not capitalise either, although, as he pointed out, “with the wind rising it was just a very difficult shot in there”.
The most disconsolate figure was was Stenson’s partner. Poor Cabrera-Bello, the Spaniard labelled by Rose as “the new Seve” following his 65 on Saturday, stood over a four-footer on the 15th to take a two-shot advantage into the final three holes. Cabrera-Bello missed and then after hacking his way up the 16th, he eventually hit his third into the water and took a double-bogey. Another wet ball on the 17th brought another double on the 17th. In 40 torrid minutes, the 30-year-old fell from first to a tie for ninth. (END OPT CUT)
In fifth came Shane Lowry, who had a huge smile on his face, despite coming so close to a birdie on the 17th and an eagle on the 18th. The Dubliner’s 66 for a 13-under total hauled him into the world’s top 50 and assured him of a debut in next year’s Masters. “It’s been hanging over me fort a few months and it’s a dream to finally get there,” Lowry said.
