Mo Farah has pulled out of Sunday’s Bupa London 10,000, a 10km road race through the streets of the capital, after failing to recover in time from his exertions in last month’s London Marathon.
The double world and Olympic champion had been due to take part in his first race since finishing eighth on his marathon debut but has decided he is not in the physical condition to resume competitive running.
His agent, Ricky Simms, said: “Mo has decided not to compete in the Bupa London 10,000 because he is not yet ready to race after the London Marathon. He took a few weeks off training, went on holiday, and just resumed jogging 10 days ago. He’s looking forward to being a guest at the event.”
Farah, who had travelled to London for the race, will act as an official starter for the race as well as a series of mile races taking place around St James’s Park in central London on Saturday.
He is now unlikely to compete again until the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix on July 12, where he has committed to run on the track over a distance yet to be announced.

Last week, Farah confirmed that he wanted to compete for England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but he has yet to decide whether he will contest the 1500, 5,000 or 10,000m.
