Missing sailors: Hull of British yacht found but no sign of life aboard

The yacht missing along with four British sailors in the Atlantic was found on Friday night, although there was still no sign of the crew.
Hours before it was due to suspend its search, the US Coast Guard said rescuers had found the hull of the Cheeki Rafiki.
In a statement it said it still intended to call off the search as the latest development failed to suggest the crew would still be alive. Its teams were due to continue looking for the vessel’s brightly-coloured life raft, but only until midnight local time.
A spokesman said that a swimmer from a US navy ship had confirmed that the back of the boat bore the name of the vessel, but was unable to make their way inside. The swimmer knocked on the hull but there was no response.
The Coast Guard said the cabin was flooded, with the windows shattered, leading to “complete flooding” inside. The vessel’s keel appeared to have broken off, causing a gap in the hull.

Captain Anthony Popiel of the 1st Coastguard District said: “It is the vessel. We have not found any survivors with it unfortunately. The helicopter saw it on one of their search patterns and a swimmer confirmed its identity.”
Hours earlier, Capt Popiel announced that the search would be suspended if nothing was sighted by midnight. Asked if this would still be the case, he said: “That will most likely still happen.”
The RAF Hercules aircraft involved in the operation, however, was expected to continue its search on Saturday.
Capt Popiel said earlier that the decision to suspend the search had been taken “only after deepest consideration”, adding: “With sincere compassion for the families of these four men, our thoughts and prayers are with them all during this difficult time.”
The Foreign Office confirmed that the families of the men had been informed that the vessel had been found. A friend of the family of James Male, one of the crew, told the BBC they remained optimistic that he might still be alive.
Earlier on Friday Kay Coombes, the sister of Steve Warren, another of the sailors, said that “hope is all we have”, as a picture emerged of the group just hours before they left for home. The photograph showed the sailors leaving an awards ceremony at Antigua Sailing Week shortly before they set sail for Britain.
The yacht carrying Mr Warren, 52, Andrew Bridge, 22, Mr Male, 23, and Paul Goslin, 56, is thought to have sunk about 620 miles east of Cape Cod on May 15. Search teams from the US Coast Guard, the US Air Force, the Canadian military and the RAF, as well as commercial vessels and volunteers, have combed more than 17,000 miles of ocean in the hunt for the crew.
The family of Mr Bridge, the crew’s captain, told the BBC that it remained “hopeful” and “appreciate everything that is being done”.
