Serena Williams stops match for a coffee after losing first set 0-6 - and recovers to win

Serena Williams interrupted her Hopman Cup match against Flavia Pennetta to ask the umpire if she could have a coffee. An espresso was duly delivered to the court and Williams recovered from losing the first set 6-0 - known in tennis as a "bagel" - to win the next two 6-3, 6-0.
The world number one laughed loudly as she checked with the chair umpire and then with the tournament referee about the legality of a coffee break, before a ball girl served her the drink on a sweltering day in Perth.
Playing her opening match of the year, the 33-year-old had looked all at sea during the first 19 minutes of the early morning match but her service in particular was transformed by the espresso.
"I'm so jet lagged and Flavia played really, really well and yeah, everyone needs coffee every now and then. I needed coffee to get my feet moving," Williams said.
"I wanted coffee with my bagel and whatever coffee it was, it was really good.

"I am a coffee drinker. I didn't have mine this morning and I was just feeling it, so I just had to get some coffee into me," she told reporters later.
"I just asked them to get me a shot of espresso. I asked them if it was legal, because I've never done it before."
Williams joked she must have been given "miracle coffee".
The 18-times grand slams singles champion is aiming for a sixth Australian Open in Melbourne later this month and is using the Hopman Cup, a lighter-hearted round robin mixed team event, as preparation for the year's first grand slam.
"My dad says, 'Serena, you've done everything, enjoy yourself, I promise you'll play better,'" Williams said. "So I'm like, 'OK'. I'm trying to relax a bit more and play how I know I can play."
She watched on from the stands and pumped her fists in delight as compatriot John Isner beat Fabio Fognini 5-7 7-5 7-6 (4) to give the U.S. the victory, with the duo making it a clean sweep by staving off match points to win the mixed doubles.
Andy Murray, who forms the Great Britain team at the event alongside Heather Watson, said he was being troubled by a lingering left shoulder problem after he beat Frenchman Benoit Paire in straight sets.
The world number six had few problems with Paire, himself on the comeback trail after injury, and won their clash 6-2, 7-5 as Great Britain beat defending champions France 2-1.
Although the French levelled the tie when Alize Cornet thrashed Watson, 6-2, 6-2, the British pair claimed the deciding mixed doubles in a match tiebreak, 6-4, 2-6, 10-8.
Murray suffered from soreness in the shoulder during and after his emphatic victory over Rafael Nadal in the season-opening tournament in Dubai last week, which he won when Novak Djokovic forfeited the final.
The dual Grand Slam champion subsequently had a scan which cleared him of any serious problems, however the shoulder again caused him discomfort in the win over Paire.
Just two weeks out from the year's first Grand Slam, the Australian Open in Melbourne, where he has been a finalist three times, the 27-year-old conceded the pain was causing him concern.
"It is still quite sore," he said.
"If it was my right shoulder it would probably be quite hard for me to play, I do not feel it on my groundstrokes as much but I feel it when I am serving.
"Maybe it was playing a match (in Abu Dhabi) after having a break or I just got it in the wrong position and tweaked something a little bit, but I should be fine."
Murray said he would continue to have treatment on the shoulder. He also said the intense heat was ideal preparation for the Australian Open.
"It was a bit of an eye-opener when we arrived at the practice court this morning and it was 44 degrees (Celsius) outside," Murray, who also beat Rafa Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in Abu Dhabi, said.
"I'm from a small town in Scotland and the weather is not quite like that there. The conditions here are fantastic to get ready for Melbourne."
