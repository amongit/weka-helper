New Zealand coach Steve Hansen expresses fears over boring rugby

The New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, has expressed his fears for the future of rugby union in an interview with Wales Online.
Hansen, who spent last weekend in Europe watching the Six Nations games between France and Wales and Ireland and England, expressed his fears that the focus on defence - something he said was a global issue rather than one specific to the northern hemisphere - would turn fans off of the game.
"I’ve actually got big concerns about the game at the moment, because there are not enough tries being scored, which is turning the fans away," said Hansen.
Ireland's win over England in Dublin was their 11th successive victory, but there have been criticisms from more fickle fans that they are too reliant on a dominant pack and the kicking of their half-backs.
"We have to get the tackle area and the offside area sorted and, like the scrummaging, it can’t just be the referees," said Hansen. "It’s got to be player and coach-driven and then policed by referees.

"The breakdown is the same. We are about to go into a showpiece for the game at the World Cup. There are going to be millions and millions of people watching it and then all you are going to see is people kick goals.
Every scrum ends up in ref giving a penalty. Every breakdown is about slowing the ball down to the point where you can’t attack, so you’ve got to kick it. Is that what rugby is about?"
A feature of this year's championship has been huge amounts of time spent by all teams going through a series of phases between the two 10m lines. However, Hansen does not believe that this lack of dynamism is unique to the Six Nations.
"I don’t think you can isolate it and say it’s a northern hemisphere problem, it’s a problem in the game.
And if we don’t address it, then we are going to get very boring rugby matches ... there are some things as a sport we have to address, otherwise our game will become a negative sport rather than a positive one."
