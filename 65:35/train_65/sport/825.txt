England v France: Scott Spedding tears turn to cheers as South African-born full-back wins over French hearts

Scott Spedding burst into tears when told he had been picked to play for France. The South African-born Bayonne full-back does not look the crying type. He is a hulking presence, tall, strong-limbed, muscular, a real handful on the move as he showed when opening up the field from the rear last weekend against Italy, counter-attacking in the spirit of la vraie France, a throwback to a Serge Blanco of old, ‘le détonateur’ in local parlance, causing enough mayhem in Italian ranks for Yoann Maestri to score.
But when French backs coach Patrice Lagisquet collared him in the corridor outside the Bayonne dressing room last November and told him he was being summoned for his international debut, Spedding was unable to control his emotions. He blubbed.
Spedding cried when he heard of his France selection
“We had just finished playing Clermont on a Friday night and I was on my way to the toilet when Patrice stopped me, handed me an envelope and told me that it was a plane ticket to join up with the French squad the next morning,” said Spedding. “I couldn’t help myself. It had been such a long road to get to that point. There were TV cameras there, too. They got it all on tape. And, yes, I have had a bit of fun poked at me for it.”
It was a big moment for the genial 28-year-old, seven years after he arrived in the country as a have-boots-will-play young man picking up a part-time youth contract in the middle of France at Brive. He was far from the madding crowd in the Correze, with no French, no friends and only a sketchy outline of what he wanted to achieve. Playing international rugby for France was certainly not on his agenda. He was there to graft, to make a go of things first and foremost, only surviving by financial handouts from his father back home in Johannesburg.
Spedding has taken to international rugby like a duck to water
“I fell in love with the place, with rugby in France, with the passion of the crowds, with the support of good people and with everything to do with the country,” said Spedding, whose selection nonetheless stirred up controversy about foreign players being picked for France. Former France wing Emile N’Tamack was particularly vocal on the matter. “I did wonder initially if I had made the right move but I was soon won over, completely so.”
Spedding had no intention of being a fly-by-night mercenary looking for an easy route into the national team. He had long since qualified on grounds of residency, doing four years at Brive before moving to Bayonne in 2012. A Test cap was still not on his radar when he relocated to the Basque country but French citizenship was.

“This was where I wanted to lead my life and that is why I applied for and got my French passport,” said Spedding. “That was important to me. It had nothing to do with rugby. And that’s why Patrice’s out-of-the-blue conversation with me took me aback so much. It was all very emotional. I owe these guys a lot. They were prepared to back me even though they knew that there was hostility at the time to picking non-French players. I have to repay that faith.”
Spedding certainly went some way to settling that debt against Italy. A follow-up display against England would certainly enhance his case for inclusion in the 36-man squad Philippe Saint-André will announce for the Rugby World Cup.

Spedding has never been to Twickenham let alone played there. He is steeling himself for a test of his character as much as of his skill. There is a sense that his counter-attacking foray at the Stadio Olimpico had a liberating effect not just on the man but on the whole team. The French team have been crabbed and hag-worn throughout much of this championship.
“It has been good to give it a go,” said Spedding. “To lose is bad enough but to lose without trying something hurts even more. We will back each other to have a crack. We succeed or fail together. We have been lacking in attack and we want to put that to rights.”
Spedding has signed for Clermont for next season, a mark of recognition for his performances this season. He has dual objectives for the next couple of months. “I want to help Bayonne avoid relegation and I want to help France finish the tournament in style. I’d be lying if I said that my introduction to international rugby has been easy. It has not. It brings with it a lot of pressure. We have had a lot of criticism and it is up to us to react to that. What I have learnt is that at international level, the mood swings are extreme. If you lose, everyone jumps down your throat. But if you win, everyone loves you.” Spoken like a true Frenchman.
