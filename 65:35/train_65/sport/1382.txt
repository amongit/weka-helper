Birmingham City Ladies progressed to the quarter-finals of the FA Women's Cup with victory over reigning Super League champions Liverpool.
Blues took the lead through Jade Moore's low finish, but Natasha Dowie headed Liverpool level soon afterwards.
After a lengthy stoppage because of an injury to Blues' Chelsea Weston, Jo Potter made it 2-1 with a free-kick.
Remi Allen sealed the win from the spot late on after Satara Murray brought Freda Ayisi down in the penalty box.
Birmingham, who were missing last season's top goal-scorer Karen Carney through suspension, started brightly and Emily Westwood dragged a close-range shot just wide early on.
The 2012 FA Cup winners took the lead when Kirsty Linnett's neat flick fed Moore, who calmly slotted home.
Liverpool drew level against the run of play when Dowie rose to glance a looping header over Blues goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer.
The game was then overshadowed by a serious knee injury to Birmingham right-back Weston, who was clearly in distress as she left the field on a stretcher after lengthy treatment.
Blues boss David Parker confirmed after the match that she could be out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury for up to 12 months.
Birmingham regained the lead thanks to an expertly-taken free-kick from England midfielder Potter, who curled into the top corner.
Liverpool's Asisat Oshoala then fired wide after hesitation from defender Kerys Harrop, but neither side was able to create any real chances after the break until substitute Ayisi was brought down in the area and Allen sealed the result.
The Reds will begin the defence of their league title at home to newly-promoted Sunderland on Wednesday.
Birmingham City Ladies boss David Parker told BBC Sport:
"I am delighted because the performance deserved that today.
"Liverpool had a lot of possession in the second half but it was about managing a game of football. We had the lead and we defended it.
"Jo (Potter) has got that quality but I look at the build-up, not just the free-kick. It was intricate, one-touch passing."
On Chelsea Weston's injury: "It is an anterior cruciate ligament injury, so you are probably looking at the season for how long she will be out, maybe a 12 months now in terms of the rehabilitation process. It is unfortunate."
Liverpool Ladies boss Matt Beard told BBC Sport:
"We are disappointed because it is a competition that we wanted to do well in this year.
"It was a tough start, coming to Birmingham, because they are strong at home. They are not very pretty but they are effective in the way they play.
"In the second half we did alright, without really creating much, but you can't give teams goals the way we did today. The free-kick - well it was not a free-kick, let's be honest. But what can you do?
"We have got to show a united front, bounce back and put in a good showing on Wednesday now."
