Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey dare to dream of Arsenal title challenge: 'You never know'

Arsenal have become adept at papering over the cracks with strong finishes to the season in the wake of their now annual spring exit from the Champions League.
Two years ago, they were unbeaten for the remainder of the campaign following their defeat by Bayern Munich, and Olivier Giroud admits it will take an equally impressive run of form if they are to halt Chelsea's march to the Premier League title.
While Arsène Wenger skilfully deflected talk of an unlikely challenge for their first domestic league crown since 2004, Giroud and Aaron Ramsey at least dared to dream, even though the smart money remains squarely on the trophy returning to Stamford Bridge in May.
Overhauling an ill at ease Manchester City, who are a single point ahead of them in second, appears a more realistic goal, despite them pegging back to four points the deficit on Chelsea, albeit having played two games more before the leaders returned to action at Hull City on Sunday.
Making a point: Olivier Giroud scores twice at Newcastle
"There's still eight games to play and first we need to win every single one of those," said Giroud, whose two first-half goals paved the way for a sixth consecutive league win and a 14th victory in 16 games in all competitions.
It is an impressive run of form, though not one to prevent them from going out of Europe's elite contest to Monaco on away goals last week, their fifth consecutive failure in the last 16.
In the space of 3½ minutes, the French forward deflected in Danny Welbeck's flick with his knee before holding off Mike Williamson to head home a Santi Cazorla corner, taking the Arsenal forward's recent personal tally to nine in as many games.
• Giroud needs more love at Arsenal - and four other things we learned
For all Arsenal's slick passing, especially in a first half where they were totally dominant, they are happy to use a more direct route to goal. They have now scored 18 times this season from set-pieces, a Premier League high. Giroud said: "We need to focus on our games and step by step we're going to see.
"We want to finish really strongly, and if we can win our games, then we will see if City or Chelsea miss one of their steps. You never know, you have to believe in football."
On target: Olivier Giroud scores for Arsenal
There was similar cautious optimism from Aaron Ramsey. "We'll try to win every game we have left and see where that takes us," the midfielder said.
"Strange things happen in the Premier League, the kind of upset where City went to Burnley and lost. We've got to be switched on and make sure that kind of result doesn't happen to us - but at the same time believe the teams around us will be on the end of upsets."
Newcastle United came from four goals down in this fixture in 2011 to force a draw. The likelihood of them achieving even half that feat after Giroud's double appeared slim to negligible, and yet after a transformed second-half display they ended the game disappointed not to have earned a draw.
Moussa Sissoko halved the deficit with a volley from Remy Cabella's cross, "a real Arsenal goal" according to John Carver, with goalkeeper David Ospina transformed from spectator to central protagonist in his efforts to repel Newcastle's surge towards a Gallowgate End equaliser.
Hurting: John Carver saw his team transformed in the second half
Ayoze Perez went close, Yoan Gouffran produced a back-pass of an effort when well placed while Ospina saved well from Sissoko as an unlikely equaliser beckoned.
"We were excellent going forward in the first-half, but had to show different qualities in the second," Wenger said, with a positive spin on his side's no-show after the break. Putting a more realistic slant on events, he said: "We suffered for 40 minutes."
Did you know Telegraph Sport has an ?
Though ultimately fruitless, it was a 45-minute display that at least added some substance to Newcastle's rebuttal to criticism that, safe in mid-table, they are merely fulfilling their remaining fixtures. An improved performance it may have been, but nevertheless they have won just twice in 12 games under Carver, whose appointment on a permanent basis in the summer would be baffling given such a damning statistic.
"People outside the club have a lot to say about our displays as a team," said Sissoko, who afforded Wenger, an admirer of the powerful midfielder, a close-up look of his undoubted talents in a fine display as stand-in skipper. Sissoko said: "We work hard every day on the training ground and are aiming to finish as high as we can."
