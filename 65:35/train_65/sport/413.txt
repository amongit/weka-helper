Alan Pardew criticises Newcastle's defence after defeat by Fulham

Newcastle’s form has been dismal, winning just one game in their last 10 in all competitions, against a Wigan Athletic side reduced to 10 men in the first-half.
For the first time since he was unveiled as a controversial replacement for Chris Hughton two years ago, Pardew’s managerial ability is being questioned on Tyneside.
Not that the 51 year-old’s job is in jeopardy. Back in October he was given an eight-year contract back by owner Mike Ashley, which was meant to symbolise the club’s faith in him, although he will not get the full compensation package if he is sacked.
Despite concern at the length of the slump, the Newcastle hierarchy have indicated they will release funds to strengthen the squad in January. By the time the transfer window opens, however, Newcastle could find themselves in the relegation zone, given the daunting nature of their festive fixture list.
The Magpies entertain Manchester City at St James’s Park on Saturday with the reigning Champions looking for an immediate recovery from last Sunday’s derby defeat to United, before taking on QPR, Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton in a short space of time.

“We conceded a soft second goal at Fulham when we had the game by the scruff of the neck,” said Pardew. “We were playing well, pushing on, and it was a poor goal. Then you’re away from home, and you’ve got to score three goals to win. It’s difficult.
"I’m worried in so much as we are not picking up enough points, that is pretty evident, It’s no good having great performances at Stoke and here, but not getting anything out of it. We’ve got to get something out of it. We’ve got to be more diligent in that final third defensively.
“We know the games coming up are hard. There are none tougher than Man City at home — you can’t look at them any differently. We can still get results in those games — we’re going to have to.”
