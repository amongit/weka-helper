Comments
England
Mike Brown: Neat work in the build-up to Youngs’s try and counter-attacked with real intent while winning the aerial battle against the French backs.
Anthony Watson: The Bath man was surprisingly quiet given this was such an open, crazy game but when he did get involved he always made ground.
Jonathan Joseph: His breakout from under the posts that led to Youngs’s second try typified his running threat. Could emerge to be one of the stars of the World Cup.
Luther Burrell: Looked nervous in the opening quarter, forced an early pass, knocked on a loose ball when the counter-attack was on and failed to make an impact.
Jack Nowell: Once again he was full of verve and competed excellently in the air, and allayed concerns about his finishing by taking his two tries superbly.
George Ford: Has been the most improved player of England’s campaign. Made the odd mistake but never stopped creating and his delayed pass for Nowell’s second try was top drawer.
Ben Youngs: No doubt about his man-of-the-match performance this week – he was England’s most potent attacking threat and took his tries superbly.
Joe Marler: Another display full of energy, tempo and work-rate. Charged down a Plisson clearance kick, held his own at scrum time and impressive defensive work.
Dylan Hartley: Solid set piece performance from the Northampton captain after a low key game against Scotland but could not match his opposite number’s involvements in the loose.
Dan Cole: Strong scrummaging display against one of the best set piece front rows around and helped win some important turnovers, but also gave away two penalties.
Geoff Parling: Brought experience and composure to England’s line-out and worked hard in the loose, despite receiving some thumping tackles all game.
Courtney Lawes: Couldn’t hold the pass that led to Tillous-Borde’s try but showed commitment with one thumping tackle on Plisson and was a destructive force all afternoon.
James Haskell: Spoiled his display with a needless trip on Plisson to leave England with 14 players just when they got to within touching distance of Ireland, but made a couple of telling impacts.
Chris Robshaw: A relentless performance from the England captain who he showed great leadership in dragging his side to within a whisker of the title.
Billy Vunipola: Delivered his best display of the championship, carrying effectively and forcing turnovers with some ferocious choke tackles and rock-like strength at restarts.

France
Scott Spedding: Least effective of all the French backs in attack and one moment of madness when running the ball across his own 22 led to a try for England.
Yoann Huget: A stunning take in the air characterised his impressive performance, he was always a danger in possession and retained the ball when under pressure.
Gael Fickou: Spilled the pass that led to Youngs’s try in a crazy opening but made amends with some moments of true class. A player of rich potential.
Maxime Mermoz: His break and sumptuous pass to Nakaitaci in the build up to Debaty’s try was worth the ticket price alone, and he oozed class in broken field.
Noa Nakaitaci: Remarkably almost blew his try by trying to run behind the posts but otherwise looked dangerous in possession and his break created Debaty’s try.
Jules Plisson: Endured a nightmare day with his boot, missing two penalties in the first half that could have put England under massive pressure at a key moment.
Sebastien Tillous-Borde: Underscored his attacking threat with an electric burst of pace to score his try and provided a swift service to Plisson.
Vincent Debaty: Richly deserved his try, showing great support to keep up with Nakaitaci, but he struggled at times to contain Cole at scrum time.
Guilhem Guirado: An impressive display from the hooker who at times operated more like a flanker with his offloading game and mobility around the park.
Nicolas Mas: Strong scrummaging performance from the veteran but not enough to give France the edge in an area of the game they hoped to dominate.
Alexandre Flanquart: Another who never stopped running and made one important line-out steal to stem England’s flow when under huge pressure.
Yoann Maestri: Showed great mobility around Twickenham turf for such a big man, and was an excellent source of line-out possession for the French all day.
Thierry Dusautoir: Lead from the front to help steady France after a rocky opening with his leadership and became a towering influence in the forward exchanges.
Bernard Le Roux: Provided France with an effective link man in the wide channels but was found wanting defensively for Youngs’s second try.
Loann Goujon: Massive carrying display put England’s pack on the back foot on a number of occasions and made a big impact in defence.
