Why we secretly love a good old-fashioned cheat

It’s tragic, I know, but men secretly admire cheats.
When the London Marathon was first run in 1981, a popular TV star of the time arranged with my friend – a very discreet VIP chauffeur – to pick him up in a side road after two miles, drive around London for about three hours and then drop him off in an alley close to Blackfriars Bridge, a couple of miles from the finishing line, so he could work up a sweat for the waiting cameras.
I don’t know if he ever tried to repeat the scam, but at the time I was bowled over in admiration for his deviousness and sheer chutzpah. He raised a fortune for charity, boosted his profile and no doubt won the admiration of colleagues. So what if he fooled everyone?
At least that was my response. My wife, on the other hand, and the wife of the star’s partner-in-crime, howled in outrage. "He’s a fraud," they screamed, "how can he live with himself?" Our approval was tantamount to betrayal, and we were told in no uncertain terms that "men are all the same, cheating is in their DNA".

London Marathon: I’m no cheat, says 'miracle' runner
True horror of the London Marathon
Now I have no idea whether personal trainer Jason Scotland-Williams (pictured above), who apparently completed this year’s London Marathon in just over three hours – the last 13 miles in just 60 minutes – is a cheat or not. He says he ran the race of his life to record a faster second half than Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah and I like to think he probably did. Miracles happen, as this time of year reminds us.
What interests me is that the reactions of those around me to his story are split straight down the middle. While the men invariably express their doubt and admiration of Mr Scotland-Williams's achievement, the women are furiously condemnatory. It's an old-school gender divide. And I think it’s because – and I must stress here that I have no evidence whatsoever that Mr Scotland-Williams cheated – men take their hats off to those who break the rules for their own gain.
Every Saturday night the pundits on Match of the Day use phrases like "he was clever there" or "he knew what he was doing" to excuse a blatant dive. They rarely utter the word cheat (worryingly, it’s most frequently used when a foreigner does the diving) because it’s an acceptable part of the game.
The bankers who got us into the financial crisis were nearly all men and were fuelled by an egocentric competitive streak that saw rewards handed out to those who, quite often, could cheat better than the rest. We delighted in their eventual capture and metaphorical public guillotining – but weren’t many of us slightly envious too that they had got away with it for so long and lived a life of endless luxury by outwitting the regulators? I certainly was – although I’ve yet to find a woman who agrees with me.
Perhaps cheating is part of the male DNA; perhaps it's a natural ramification of our vain and greedy streaks. Infidelity is often instigated by married men because we want what we can’t have, or shouldn’t have. We want more sex, more money, more adulation, more success and we will do all we can to satiate those carnal desires. When we see others triumph by dubious means, we silently applaud their atrocious behaviour because we know we’re just as capable of displaying it.
Women can’t believe people would behave so appallingly. Men know that we do all the time.
When the saintly Delia Smith released a cookery book entitled ‘How To Cheat’, it failed within her core fan base – women – because they were incredulous that someone so gifted could possibly stoop so low. It was as though the word ‘cheat’ tainted her reputation among women – whereas men saw it as a badge of honour, and consequently bought truckloads of the book, making it a bestseller.
We exist in a brutal dog-eat-dog world in which drugged athletes, plagiarising writers and duplicitous bosses cheat to get ahead. Perhaps that’s what unfettered capitalism does to people, encourages them to place success over morality. The conundrum is not why this happens, but why the worst culprits – and most forgiving observers – always seem to be men.
