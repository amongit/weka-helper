GALLERY: TOP 25 BEST HOCKEY PLAYERS
A first-half hat-trick in just 16 minutes at the weekend left East Grinstead coach Karl Stagno under no illusions: Ashley Jackson is "one of, if not the best player" in the world right now.
So, with Olympic qualifiers beginning in May and Europe's elite on show at the EuroHockey Championships later this summer, Telegraph Sport decided to rank the current best 25 in the world.
However, our aim was to compile a list with a slight difference. We wanted to amalgamate the men's and women's game into one comprehensive ranking.

After all, there is a Champions Trophy for both sexes, the last World Cup was a dual one and the European Championships will see both men and women compete.
