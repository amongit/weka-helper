Jonathan Trott has returned to an England squad for the first time since having to leave the 2013-14 Ashes with a stress-related problem.
Trott, who flew home after the opening defeat in Brisbane 16 months ago, is recalled in a 16-man touring party for three Tests in the West Indies.
The squad, announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board on Wednesday morning, also includes a return for Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes as well as places for his fast-bowling county team-mate Mark Wood and Yorkshire's spinner Adil Rashid and opening batsman Adam Lyth - all three as yet uncapped at Test level.

Lyth is likely to contend with Trott for a vacant opener's slot alongside Alastair Cook in place of the dropped Sam Robson.
Lyth and Rashid are among six Yorkshire players selected as Cook picks up the reins again after being replaced as World Cup captain before Christmas, only for England to then endure a miserable early exit from the global tournament under Eoin Morgan.

Eight of those who fell short in the 50-over format, knocked out by Bangladesh last week, are retained for the Test trip to the Windies which begins early next month.

National selector James Whitaker takes note of the importance of starting an Ashes year well.
He said: "This series marks the start of a busy period of Test Match cricket for the England team, and I am sure that Alastair and the players will all be keen to build on the success they enjoyed last summer against India.
"Jonathan Trott produced some outstanding performances for Warwickshire last summer, scoring five centuries, and also made an unbeaten double-hundred during the recent successful England Lions tour.

"Adam, Adil and Mark are all players who have performed impressively over the last 12 months - and they will now have an opportunity to push for a regular place in the Test side's starting line-up."
