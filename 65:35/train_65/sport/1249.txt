How charismatic manager Louis van Gaal put Manchester United back on the right track

It has probably taken until now for Manchester United to fully quantify and come to terms with the earthquake effect of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in May 2013. The aftershocks are still being felt.
It has probably taken until now, with last Sunday’s exciting 3-0 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, for United to not only regain some of that swagger of old, but to provide clear evidence of the way forward. There is a gathering sense at the club that things are clicking into place.
The timing could be crucial given United face Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday with the fight for a top-four finish, and Champions League qualification, fiercely intense and close. United are desperate to remain in that top four and return to Europe’s elite club competition, but it is as much to subjugate Liverpool as to be back in a competition where they feel they belong.
Having taken soundings and been given an indication of the thinking inside the club, it is crystal clear that neither United’s financial health nor Louis Van Gaal’s prospects are dependent on Champions League qualification this season.
Van Gaal is a hard task master
Financially, United believe they can absorb not being in the competition for some time yet – such is their power – but competitively, sportingly, it will be a failure and one that is difficult to argue away even if the club is adamant it is now firmly on the right track.
That United have struggled to convince is emphatically not held against Van Gaal, even though it is accepted that as ‘holistically’ impressive as the 63-year-old Dutchman has been since he arrived – in terms of his charismatic personality and desire to have an influence throughout the club and take an interest – he has found it harder going than expected.
But then, with hindsight, there was perhaps also an inevitability to that, with United now concluding that this is a transitional year after the departure of Ferguson and the failure of David Moyes’ unfortunate and possibly also not fully-supported regime – although that was inadvertent – and then into Van Gaal.
It may take the full term of Van Gaal’s three-year contract for the ripple effect from Ferguson’s retirement to finally subside. It may even take longer although by then United are confident they will be challenging again.
Sir Alex Ferguson left a big hole to fill
The whole club revolved around Ferguson and, with hindsight, there is a deeper realisation that better support could perhaps have been put in place for Moyes – which now exists for Van Gaal – but also the job of controlling everything at United is too big for one man. It would be too big for Ferguson if he was starting afresh.
It is also akin, in a business sense, to an entrepreneurial start-up company which has grown hugely and enjoyed outstanding success and phenomenal dividends to then try and make the change to a different kind of operation once its founder departed. It takes time. New systems have to be put in place and that does not happen overnight.
Moyes famously once said that United was “a machine that isn’t broken” when asked what changes he would make and although that was true it did not mean that change was not necessary after Ferguson’s retirement.
He was that larger-than-life entrepreneur – the man who everyone at United looked to when they needed an answer because the club had grown so massively under him and he contained so much knowledge and force of personality within him to drive it forward.
Ferguson and Van Gaal are cut from the same cloth
At the same time United are now attempting to ensure that they bottle the culture that Ferguson created – especially when it comes to the development of young players. It is why the work that former midfielder Nicky Butt does, as head of coaching at United’s academy, is regarded as very important.
Van Gaal has an input across every part of the club – and his opinion is valued – but crucially he does not have responsibility for everything. He is concentrating far more on the first-team and United are expecting another significant summer of transfer activity as he starts to fully plan for the changes he wants.
Van Gaal was involved in transfer activity last year but largely from afar with that being interrupted while he was at the World Cup.
It has been a challenging season as Van Gaal has grappled with line-ups and personnel and having struggled with his preferred approach of 4-3-3 which is not too dissimilar to Ferguson’s 4-4-2.

That Van Gaal has been unable to implement his system has revealed the extent to which he feels he has been in a crisis-mode just as he was when he went into the last World Cup with Holland and abandoned his approach to shift to that 3-5-2.
At United it feels like he is finally coming out of the firefighting. He will be given a clear run this summer to reshape his squad and more specifically the right-side of his team.
The priority is undoubtedly a ‘number six’ – a deep-lying midfielder to organise the team and shape the play – more than a ‘number eight’ with Juventus’s Paul Pogba emerging as United’s firm target.
Not that Van Gaal will go for the players who are obvious. United have been impressed not just by his personality and deep knowledge of the game but for his commitment to try and develop young players – such as James Wilson – and also how he proposes names not previously considered.
There is certainly no pressure on Van Gaal to play Angel Di Maria, even though he cost a British record £59.7million, or Radamel Falcao, even though he is earning £265,000-a-week on loan from Monaco. If he wants to go with Wilson or Adnan Januzaj then it is no problem for anyone at the club.
Angel di Maria has struggled after a promising start
United recognise that not only is Van Gaal a major figure with a powerful personality and a track record in delivery but that he is what can be termed a ‘90/10 manager’. He can take 90 per cent of the players with him and alienate 10 per cent – which is not a bad ratio. Virtually everyone buys into his approach it seems.
With Pogba, or that type of player – such as Roma’s Kevin Strootman, who has long been linked as a Van Gaal target, but who is now sidelined again until pre-season following knee surgery – a priority then the other priority in terms of immediate first-team players is a central defender who is comfortable in bringing the ball forward out of defence. That might point towards Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels.
The other areas of the team where Van Gaal wants to strengthen include: a right-winger or right-sided midfielder to add width; a striker, should Falcao leave as is now expected after his struggle to regain form; and possibly a right-back.
United’s transfer strategy is clear. Van Gaal has a reputation for identifying and promoting young players and that will continue, but the club are also in the market for ready-made first-team recruits such as Pogba and are prepared to pay for them.
The club is regarded in a bracket alongside Chelsea and Manchester City as being able to financially compete to bring world superstars to the Premier League. Liverpool and Arsenal – despite the signing of Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez – still looking to purchase potential. If a United target is older but is still the best player for the team then his age will not be a barrier to a bid.
United have been linked with a move for Paul Pogba
None of the recruitment is contingent on United finishing in the top four and neither will that affect the spending power available to Van Gaal. The manager has also never been told that finishing third in the Premier League is the minimum requirement this season.
That position was stated in a conference call to investors by United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward last September but was misinterpreted to mean it was what was expected of Van Gaal. Indeed ‘third place’ has been the position United have used for the past 10 years as a way of setting budgets and projecting the finances. In reality there is no short-term financial impact between finishing third or fifth.
It would be a huge disappointment not to be in the Champions League next season but not a disaster.
United are delighted with Van Gaal who has fully embraced the club. Employees having taken to someone whose personality is far warmer and more engaging than his public personae and who, with wife Truus, is loving life in England.
An example of that emerged at a United Christmas party where Van Gaal spoke to around 250 people. It is a small detail but it is impressive that he made the effort and it did not go unappreciated throughout United.
Culturally, and in terms of personality, there is a belief that Van Gaal fits well with United. The lines of communication are good. He is highly-regarded by the club’s owners.
There is also now hope that the team’s performances are also beginning to reflect that. But then everyone needed things to settle down after the reality of the earthquake effect of Ferguson’s retirement was appreciated.
