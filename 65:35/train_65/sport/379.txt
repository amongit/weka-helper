Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic: Brit admits he's up against the King of the Australian Open

Andy Murray has acknowledged that he will be going up against the king of Rod Laver Arena on Saturday, a man who has won 28 of his last 29 matches on Melbourne Park's centre court.
That is only one of many statistics that make Novak Djokovic, already a four-time Australian Open champion, the favourite to win a fifth title on Sunday. Yet there are also reasons for British fans to be hopeful, for Murray has been the form player of the tournament to date.
The fuss over Kim Sears's indiscretions on Thursday rather obscured the fact that he had just ousted Tomas Berdych with his strongest performance since the 2013 Wimbledon final.
Writing in the Melbourne Age newspaper on Sunday, Murray said he has now gathered the experience to face his oldest rival a man he first came up against in a junior tournament in 1999 on equal terms.
"The first few times we played, I think that he probably matured I would say quicker than me," wrote Murray of Djokovic. "And he also had more experience than me from a young age.

"Like when I played against him in the slams early on, he'd already won a slam or he'd already been in those positions a lot more than me. Whereas now I feel like he probably still has more experience, but that the experience isn't necessarily a factor in the match because we've both been there, played each other a bunch of times in these tournaments: the Olympics and big matches. That's a factor really."
Murray and Djokovic have already encountered each other three times at this event, and the last two were classics. There was the five-set semi-final of 2012, Murray's first really big match under the coaching regime of Ivan Lendl. And then there was the final the following year, when he paused to collect a floating seagull feather at a critical moment, served a double-fault, and never quite recovered.
But whatever the details, Djokovic won on each occasion, maintaining that almost Bradmanesque record on Australian soil. "He has a fantastic record here," said Murray. "He obviously loves the court and the conditions. And, yeah, it would be a big upset if I manage to win tomorrow.
"I don't feel like I'm going into the match expecting to win because of how well Novak's played over the last six months," added Murray, who is guaranteed to return to the world's top four on Monday for the first time since January 2014.
"But no-one would have expected me to be in this position after how I finished last year either. So I'm just happy to be back playing close to my best tennis again."
Hopes of a double celebration for British tennis this weekend have already been scotched after 15-year-old Katie Swan lost in Saturday's girls' final to Tereza Mihalikova of Slovakia. Swan was looking to become the first Briton to lift the title since Annabel Croft 30 years ago, but she had burned a lot of energy in Friday's 2hr 36min semi-final and that caught up with her towards the end of a 6-1, 6-4 defeat.
"I think it's a strain in my groin," she said. "If I didn't have this and I could move fully, I think I would have had a better chance of taking that [second] set. But I was still pleased with the way I fought. It's been an amazing week, the best experience I've ever had."
