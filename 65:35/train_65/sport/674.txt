Franck Ribéry, the France and Bayern Munich winger, has announced his retirement from international football in an interview with the German magazine Kicker.
The 31-year-old, who was Uefa's European Player of the Year in 2013, won 81 caps and scored 16 international goals since making his debut for France in 2006. After battling throughout May to be fit for the World Cup he failed to make it to Brazil, where France lost to Germany in the quarter-finals, despite intensive treatment .
"I am retiring. I realised the time had come," he said, adding that he had taken the decision "for personal reasons".
"I want to spend more time with my family, to concentrate on playing for Bayern Munich and also to open the way for the many other young talented players in the national side. You have to know when to stop and the time has come to call it a day.
"And we saw during the World Cup that France have nothing to worry about as far as the future is concerned."

Ribéry was forced to sit out Wednesday's German Supercup match with Borussia Dortmund with a knee injury but hopes to be fit for the first match of the Bundesliga season against Wolfsburg on August 22.
"There were highs and lows but now is the time to start a new chapter in my life," he said.
Ribéry's France career was almost ruined by a players' revolt at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with the winger at the forefront of the strike in support of forward Nicolas Anelka who had been kicked out of the squad for insulting then coach Raymond Domenech.
His reputation at home was tarnished and he was given a three-match ban for his involvement in the controversy after France's disappointing first-round exit.
