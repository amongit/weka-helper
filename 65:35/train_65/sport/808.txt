What our experts said: Four went with May's effort against New Zealand, one went for Bowe's try, and two picked Nick Phipps' second for Australia against Ireland.
What mark would you give England out of 10 and why this autumn?
What you said: The majority of you went with option C: 6 - Forward work was outstanding but they still need good transition play from forward momentum into team attacks
What our experts said: They gave an average mark of 5.6.
Who enhanced their World Cup prospects?
What you said: The most popular option here was: Ireland - appear the home nation most likely to win the Webb Ellis Trophy, which got 48% of the vote. George Ford was the next choice, picking up 30% of the vote.
What our experts said: Ireland and Jonny May were the most popular choices.
Biggest issue raised from this series of games?
What you said: The most selected option was: The TMO - it is clear that it has become an unwieldy and even misleading process (36%). Next up were concerns about England's ability to raise their attacking game (23%), followed by the homophobic abuse aimed at referee Nigel Owens (21%) during the England v New Zealand match.
What our experts said: A range of issues were mentioned, but the TMO clearly continues to rile.
