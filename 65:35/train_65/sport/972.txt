UFC middleweight Gegard Mousasi meets the legend Dan Henderson early next year, but has half an eye on a contest with Michael Bisping in 2015. But a period of rest and recuperation meant stringent medical checks and some intense therapy – playing indoor six-a-side football.
Mousasi just wasn’t himself last time out in the Octagon against Jacare Souza – those mercurial skills seemed to have deserted him. But back in action on Jan 24 on the massive UFC Sweden card puts him in the frame against Henderson, one of mixed martial arts’ all-time legends.
Mousasi believes they “match up well” and reckons they’ll put on an entertaining fight for the fans at the Tele2 Arena. “I've been taking some rest – I needed to rest to re-energise. Dan Henderson and me fought in the same tournament and he's a legend. I'm very happy to fight him.”
“I think he is such a big name. Of course, it's great to fight him, so I can get a win over a name like Dan Henderson.
“I feel my style matches very well against his. He comes to fight and I don't have to worry about a lot of jiu jitsu stuff.
“I can just scramble and go and give my all. I feel I can match up well with him anywhere – stand up or ground. It's a good fight, style-wise.”
They have even shared work time in the past. “I've trained with him before when I was in the US. It was for the EA stuff. We trained well. He's a nice guy.”

Mousasi, like fans in Europe, is delighted with the level of the card in Stockholm on Jan 24. “It's incredible. I think it's one of the biggest in Europe. It's a great card. Me against Dan Henderson and Alexander Gustafsson against Anthony Johnson is a hell of a fight card.”
“Then you add Ryan Bader against Phil Davis. Dan Henderson is a big name, so it will be 50-50 with the fans, I think. I'm more from Europe, but he's a legend of the sport.”
Mousasi was clearly down physically when he fought Souza, and feels he may have ‘overtrained’. “I've never felt like that before. In that fight, I just wasn't me at all. I've never had that before. I just didn't have the spirit of fighting.
“I was really shocked at how badly I performed. I think I may have been burned out a little bit. If I was to blame it on something, it would be that. I trained too long.
“Coming off injuries and fighting three tough guys, I felt I wasn't in the fight from the start. Even when I walked into the cage, you could see that it just wasn't me in there.
“It was one of the worst performances I've ever had. That can happen if you fight so long. It was definitely not me.”
Mousasi went for medical checks afterwards. “I've been to the doctor's, but the doctor just tells me to go rest. The system here is not the same as it is elsewhere. I've done the blood tests and it seemed normal, average.
“Maybe it was more mental and a case of overtraining. It's OK, I still have time. I am healthy, but you never know. I didn't feel so good for the fight. Mentally I was good, but physically I wasn't there. It showed.”
Mousasi believes his weight-cut may have been one of the causes. “The weight cut is normally good but this time, because of the timing, I decided to do everything in one day and that didn't work out well. I don't blame it on that. I just wasn't in the fight from the start.”
He took six weeks off. Active, and less so … at times. “I played a lot of soccer with friends indoors. Just a bunch of friends. It's normally five- or six-a-side, depending on how many guys turn up. I also play PlayStation sometimes. I play FIFA and shooting games like Call of Duty.”
Mousasi is a keen footballer. “I follow the Champions League sometimes if they have big matches. Let's say Bayern Munich plays Real Madrid or Barcelona. I'd watch that. But not all of them.
"I like Lionel Messi, and I like Bayern Munich a lot. They play well. They've got a good team this year. Messi is humble and he's the best player. He does hard things and makes them look easy. I'm not a good footballer. Not bad, but nothing special. I'm just the guy who gives the good passes.”
Next year remains an important time for Mousasi, who has plenty of excellent stylistic matchups in the middleweight division. The key will be staying healthy.
“I want to start with a good win and hopefully fight three times in 2015. This fight is very important for me. A win will give me that rhythm of winning again and that desire. This fight is very important to get 2015 started well. A fight in the future against Alexander would be good. He's a huge name and a win over him would be good for me.”
Mousasi turns his thoughts to the UK, too. “I think Bisping makes sense very much. It would also be an exciting fight. I think people would want to see that fight. But first I have to beat Dan Henderson before I can even think about that.
“There's a possibility that I'll go to Sweden and train with Gustafsson for maybe a week or two. I'll see how it goes. Dan Henderson doesn't have a specific style. He's not like Machida, for example. You have a lot of different sparring partners to replicate him.”
Indeed. It promises to be some fight.
