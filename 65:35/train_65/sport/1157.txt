Cooke, 20, endured a nightmare in his first and weakest event, the fencing, and was in a lowly 29th place seemingly out of contention as he concentrated on the other four disciplines.
He is however the strongest modern pentathlon swimmer in the world – junior or senior – having set a world record of 1.49.59 for the 200m back in July and after storming to his expected victory in the swimming – the nearest competitor finished over seven seconds behind – he started to climb steadily up through the rankings.
An impressive ride put Cooke back in medal contention in fifth place and he finished the job with an outstanding run/shoot element to defeat Pavel Iliashenko from Kazakhstan and Germany's Alexander Nobis.
Great Britain's last junior world champion was Heather Fell who took the title in Greece in 2003.
"I think this is my biggest achievement yet. I didn't expect to win here, especially after my fence," said Cooke.

UIPM 'very satisfied' with Greenwich Park
"There was a lot of pressure on me in the run/shoot as there were some fantastic runners around me. My main goal at this event was just to get experience for next year's senior tour. That was amazing, just fantastic and give me a lot of confidence going into an important Olympic year.
"I was second at the World Youths a few years ago and when I realised I had a chance of winning after the second shoot here I told myself there would be no way that I would be coming second."
It takes Britain's medal tally at the championships so far to three after Freyja Prentice's individual bronze in the women's final on Saturday, when the women's team of Prentice, Kate French and Lydia Rosling also won the gold.
