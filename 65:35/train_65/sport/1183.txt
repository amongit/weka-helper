LA Galaxy captain Robbie Keane is the undisputed king of Major League Soccer

Robbie Keane made it abundantly clear where the balance of power lay – not only at LA Galaxy but also in Major League Soccer – when asked about Steven Gerrard's forthcoming arrival at the MLS Cup champions in the summer.
"He is arriving as an addition, not as a replacement as captain," Keane told reporters.
"I have spoken to Steven and he is excited about the challenge of coming to LA Galaxy. He is going to be a great addition to our squad."
The confidence that Keane had in himself to say of Gerrard that he is a mere "addition" shows just how far the veteran Republic of Ireland international has come since he swapped north London for southern California in 2011.
Keane, now 34, may have felt a need in the off-season to fend off any pretenders to his MLS crown since Landon Donovan's abdication in December – the crown princes being Gerrard, David Villa, Kaka and USA internationals Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley.

However, the much-travelled striker – who played for eight clubs in three countries prior to his MLS switch – sits comfortably on his new throne having not only settled in Los Angeles, but positively thrived.
Having recently been garlanded by the presidents of the United States and Ireland, Keane clearly mixes well in high society.

Keane started his Galaxy career with a goal against the San Jose Earthquakes and his stock has risen to superstar status. Last season he scored a dramatic extra-time winner to seal his third MLS Cup in his most prolific campaign for the franchise, in which he scored 19 goals (third in the league) and recorded 14 assists (tied for second).
Keane is also the reigning MVP - the first European to win the MLS's highest individual honour – yet his coach Bruce Arena believes he is the league's greatest designated player of all time, ahead of the likes of David Beckham.
“He’s the most valuable player. He’s won the most championships. There is a legacy of some great players when you think about [David] Beckham and Thierry Henry, there have been many others. The early days there was Roberto Donadoni, Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno, who were outstanding,” said Arena.
“There have been a lot of top players in our league, but probably few that have achieved the success that Robbie has, both personally and with his goals. His professionalism day in, day out. His leadership of the team, his influence on our younger players, important qualities he brings to the club.
“He’s the most valuable player in our league right now and continues to maintain his international career with Ireland, which we think is great. He has certainly been a great addition, not only to LA Galaxy, but to Major League Soccer in the United States.”

Alexi Lalas, the former USA international and LA Galaxy general manager who now works for ESPN, concurred.
"Robbie Keane has been the best designated player signing in the history of MLS," Lalas said. "I can't say enough about how wonderful a signing he has been, not just for the Galaxy but for MLS.
"From a tactical point of view, there is an incredible respect for his intelligence on the field. I ask all the coaches in my TV work, 'If there is one player you could have, who would it be?' Invariably they say Robbie Keane. That has nothing to do with selling tickets or a sexy signing but he would help them become a better team and they base that on what they have seen with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
"His footprint is so much larger than if he had kept going in the [Premier League]."

When Keane moved to LA Galaxy he said it was a "dream come true" and so it has proved. While some denigrators may say that Keane went to the MLS for an easy ride and a comfortable pay cheque, one only needs note the troubles of Jermain Defoe – his former team-mate at Tottenham Hotspur – at Toronto FC to see just how successful Keane has been in the United States.
By going to the MLS and buying into the league and all it has to offer, Keane has ensured a glorious end to a long career that promised much ever since his stunning debut as a 17-year-old at Wolves but never quite managed to live up to the hype, as big-money moves to Inter Milan and Liverpool proved.
This he certainly could not have achieved as a squad player in the Premier League or Championship.

And Keane, for his part, isn't planning on going anywhere any time soon.
“If I feel the way I feel now, of course I want to play as long as I can,” he added on Galaxy's pre-season tour to Ireland. “I look at people over the years, like Teddy Sheringham, who I played with, (and he) played for a long time. Ryan Giggs played for a long time. As long as I look after myself and keep myself fit, and depending on injuries, I can certainly see myself playing on for that long.
“I do a bit of yoga. It’s good for your stretching but I’m fairly flexible anyway. Maybe that’s the reason why I don’t get too many muscle injuries. But for me, it’s about having the hunger and the drive to play. I still want to score goals and compete at the highest level. That, more than anything, motivates me.”
Keane is ready to reign the MLS for a long time yet.
