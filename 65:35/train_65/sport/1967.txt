LeBron Game 7 GIF: Every Shot NBA Finals MVP Made In Final Game vs. Spurs
LeBron James made 12 of his 23 shot attempts in Game 7 of the NBA Finals en route to a 37-point performance. Five of them were three-pointers and nearly all of them were from the perimeter.
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called James' performance "Hall of Fame basketball."
Now, because it's the internet, we can watch the 2013 NBA Finals MVP make every shot he made in Game 7 at the same time.
