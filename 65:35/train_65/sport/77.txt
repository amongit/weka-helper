Chris Buescher will replace Moffitt for his Sprint Cup debut
FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Buescher will make his NASCAR Sprint Cup debut this weekend for Front Row Motorsports.
Buescher was named Brett Moffitt's replacement in the No. 34 Ford on Friday.
Moffitt is moving up to Michael Waltrip Racing's No. 55 Toyota to fill in for Brian Vickers, who is out indefinitely with a reoccurrence of blood clots.
The 22-year-old Buescher has one victory and 18 top-10 finishes in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, and he still will compete in Saturday's Xfinity race before Sunday's Cup race. He has done numerous Cup test sessions for Roush Fenway Racing.
