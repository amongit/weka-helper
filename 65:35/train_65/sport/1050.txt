A World Cup at Christmas? Why stop there?

Not content with ruining football, Sepp Blatter is now set to ruin Christmas as well.
Since Qatar will have the World Cup no matter what, and it’s approximately 187 degrees there in the summer, the World Cup is set to be moved to late November and December… raising the prospect of a World Cup Final on December 23rd.

Horrific. But why stop there? So many other events could easily be moved around the calendar.
Lent, invented to celebrate the time Jesus went in to the wilderness to avoid temptation and work on his body after reading Men’s Health article ‘Six Weeks To Chiselled Crucifixion Abs’, simply has to go. Increasingly just a war on chocolate, it should come at the beginning of the year when one is still feeling fat from Christmas.

Any last leftover bits of turkey could be combined with flour and sugar to make A Deeply Disappointing Pancake Day to remind everyone of how Jesus suffered over Easter, and how we all suffered having to spend Christmas with our in-laws.

The Christian period of denial would move into the place of Dry January, which is in itself terribly badly positioned. There can be no worse possible time of the year to go without drink than the first, depressing, hard-up month, when a nice teacup full of whisky is an essential defence against the recriminations of shattered resolutions.
Dry January would fit in nicely during February, which is three days shorter, if nothing else. The 28th of the month should be celebrated as a Bank Holiday of Booze, with a Leap Year becoming a double holiday for an Epic Leap Bender.
The end-February booze up would need to borrow the day off from the first May Bank Holiday. May is already a basically decent month – the weather is getting warmer, the football season is coming to a climax, cricket is underway, lunchtime sunbathing has begun. It can spare at least one of its bank hols.
If February is to become dry, it would be necessary to move Valentine’s Day, because the prospect of having to sit through an overpriced ‘Special Couples Menu’ without recourse to strong drink is not to be entertained.

The worst day in the calendar for any right-thinking person could ideally be combined with Halloween, whose primary purpose now appears to be to allow female students to dress up as ‘saucy’ nurses and/or witches, which most people seem to like, apart from nurses. They would be allowed a day off. Witches would need to apply on a case-by-case basis.
With due respect to the Easter Bunny, who does tireless work for the confectionery industry despite combining it with being the Conservative MP for Chocolton West, Easter’s time has been and gone. At least in April. It makes much more sense to move it into a two-for-one deal with Christmas. That annoying bridging period between Christmas and New Year is a sad, fat limbo, and we might as well get all of the chocolate out of the way in one go.

To clear space for the World Cup, we could move all of the Premier League football into Super January, making it a brilliant, if exhausting, month of football and allowing the likes of Jack Wilshere 11 other months to really work on their smoking.
This would clear the rest of the sporting calendar for England’s cricketers to play back-to-back-to-back-to-back Ashes series from February through until November, with the law of averages suggesting surely that they cannot lose to Mitchell Johnson every time.
The sporting calendar would culminate on Bonfire Night, combined with a moved Easter Monday allowing ritual burning of effigies of the moustachioed Australian cricketer followed by a joyful resurrection of the English batting on the third day after tea.
The August Bank Holiday would be moved to Christmas, allowing us to share with Australians the joy of eating turkey on the beach in 30 degree heat, or at least turkey sandwiches while freezing to death in the car and staring balefully at the festive rain.
If it’s alright with Sepp, of course.
