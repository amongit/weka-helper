Martina Navratilova hits out at ITF over Shamil Tarpischev's comments on Serena and Venus Williams

Comments
Martina Navratilova has questioned the “silence” of the International Tennis Federation after one of its members described world No 1 Serena Williams and her older sister Venus as “brothers”.
Shamil Tarpischev, the Russian Tennis Federation president, was banned for a year and fined $25,000 (£15,500) by the Women’s Tennis Association after making the comments on local television on Friday.
Navratilova, who won a total of 59 grand slam singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles, praised the speedy action by the WTA to defend Serena and the former world No 1 Venus, winner of seven grand slam singles titles, but criticised the ITF.
“The silence from the ITF has been pretty deafening,” she said in Singapore ahead of the start of the WTA Finals on Monday. “They are the ones who have actually the possibility of doing something as Tarpischev is head of the Russian Tennis Federation, which falls under the ITF and is also Fed Cup captain, which falls under the ITF.
“The WTA has done all they can do. They certainly have shown they have Serena’s back and Venus’s back and he might have thought the comment was funny but it was anything but. Certainly this kind of bullying comment cannot be tolerated from anyone, but particularly from a high up official in the tennis world.”

Tarpischev, also an International Olympic Committee member, offered an apology on Saturday at the behest of the WTA, whose chief executive, Stacy Allaster, said that the comments were “insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport”.
Serena Williams, winner of 18 grand slam singles titles, labelled the comments by Tarpischev as “very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist” prior to the defence of the season-ending title. “I thought they were in a way bullying,” she added on Sunday.
The ITF said it hoped Tarpischev’s WTA punishment and apology to the Williams sisters, who have teamed up to win 13 grand slams and three Olympic gold medals in doubles, could draw a line under the incident.
“The ITF was very disappointed when it learnt that Shamil Tarpischev, longtime president of the Russian Tennis Federation, made derogatory remarks about the gender of Serena and Venus Williams,” Francesco Ricci Bitti, the ITF president, told Reuters.
“What Mr Tarpischev said was wholly unacceptable to the ITF and, when we learnt of the issue, we encouraged him to apologise immediately. Although Mr Tarpischev assured us that his comment was meant as a joke, we made it clear to him that what he said is inappropriate in any context.
“We hope that his acceptance of fault in this matter, which includes the penalty assessed by the WTA Tour, will allow all of us to move forward.”
Williams opened the WTA Finals by beating her Australian Open conqueror, Ana Ivanovic, 6-4, 6-4.
The tournament is making its debut in Singapore after moving from Istanbul but a different venue could not stop the run of the four-time champion Williams, who was a doubt for the tournament with a knee injury.
She told BT Sport: “I’m really excited with how I played. I couldn’t be happier to be playing here in Singapore. I was fighting really hard. Ana played so well. I think I’m losing my voice from saying so many ‘Come ons’.”
