Steffon Armitage faces suspended jail sentence if guilty of assault

Steffon Armitage faces the prospect of a six-month suspended jail sentence and a €5,000 (£3,700) fine if found guilty of assault after the Toulon flanker appeared in a French court yesterday.
Armitage, who has won five England caps and is the European Player of the Year, was arrested last month along with team-mate Xavier Chiocci following an alleged incident involving a 30‑year-old professional tennis coach in a beachfront restaurant.
Armitage, who had been under consideration for a place in England’s World Cup squad despite the collapse of a move to Bath in October, is alleged to have struck a 31-year-old on Dec 13 in a Toulon restaurant after an evening drinking with team-mates following their side’s 23-8 victory against Leicester in the European Champions Cup. The row resulted in the alleged victim, who was also present during the hearing, being unable to work for 45 days.
Armitage denied any wrongdoing but admitted to being “very ­inebriated”, adding that he did not remember hitting anyone voluntarily.
“I contest the charges against me. I do not remember anything,” Armitage said in court, according to La Provence newspaper.

“I was really drunk and feel that I unintentionally fell on the victim, this injuring him but without doing it intentionally. One thing is for certain, I very much regret being drunk; I’m a professional player and as such must set an example.”
That claim was contradicted by the victim’s lawyer Virginie Pin, who stated that Armitage had approached her client after the incident asking him not to file a complaint. The tribunal will make its ruling on Feb 24.
Armitage has not been considered by England because he is based in France since moving to Toulon from London Irish in 2011.
However, Stuart Lancaster, the England head coach, is understood to have been giving serious consideration to invoking the “exceptional circumstances” clause in the Rugby Football Union’s selection policy before the World Cup.
If Armitage is found guilty of the assault, however, it will almost certainly rule him out of contention given Lancaster’s strict stance on off-field discipline.
