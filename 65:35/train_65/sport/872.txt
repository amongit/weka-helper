Chelsea v Arsenal: Diego Costa insists he is fit to play and eager to avoid club-versus-country row

Diego Costa has confirmed that he is fit to face Arsenal in their Premier League match on Sunday – and has insisted that he does not want a club-versus-country “war” after Jose Mourinho questioned whether the striker should be picked for Spain.
Costa, 25, has been suffering from tight hamstrings with the Chelsea manager suggesting that the forward is not only unable to train properly but cannot play two games inside four days.
However, Costa played the full 90 minutes in the Champions League tie away against Sporting Lisbon, having faced Aston Villa last Saturday, with Mourinho admitting that it was a “risk” for him to play in Portugal.
Mourinho has also suggested that Spain would be better advised leaving Costa out of their forthcoming European Championship qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg so he can rest fully.
Costa, however, said that he hoped there would not be a problem between Spain and Chelsea and referred to the emotionally draining row he was involved in before the World Cup as to whether he would play for the country of his birth, Brazil, before opting for the country where he made his name, Spain.

“I think it is something that cannot happen,” Costa said of the potential dispute. “There was already a war with the Brazil issue, and now I need to be left in peace to try and do things well for the national team.
"That is what I need and hopefully I will be in this next squad.”
Costa said he expected to be ready to play against Arsenal.
“Of course. Certain. I played 90 minutes [against Sporting] and now I can have a rest. I do not see a problem. To play 90 minutes suggests I am OK.
"Every time I play I feel better and it is a decision for the manager the best way to recuperate from the injury.”
Nevertheless, the forward confirmed that he is unable to take a full part in training at Chelsea because of the condition of his hamstring.
“Normally I try to forget it during the games so it does not inhibit my performance,” Costa said.
“It does not enter my head. It is a negative way of thinking and I try to avoid negative thoughts, not just in this but in life in general.
"You are just thinking about ­playing in the best way, not worrying about what might happen. During the week I am working intensively with the physios, but [Mourinho] asks me regularly how I am to make sure I am in the best possible shape.
“The injury is not so bad. I will keep working to return to complete fitness. Every day I feel better. There are a few niggles that are annoying me, but I am working to treat them during the week with the physios and the club’s medical staff. Every day I feel closer.
“There are days when I do not train so I can prevent problems, but there are other days when I can train.”
