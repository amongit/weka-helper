Jonas Bjorkman hopes to "bring energy and enjoyment" to Andy Murray's practice sessions and thinks the Briton has "some interesting years" ahead.
The 42-year-old former Wimbledon semi-finalist will join Murray's coaching team for a five-week trial this month.
"After that we will have time to discuss our roles and how we can approach things," said Bjorkman.
Amelie Mauresmo is world number four Murray's main coach but only works with the Scot for 25 weeks a year.
The Swede is a former world number four in singles and a former number one in doubles. He reached the singles semi-finals at both Wimbledon and the US Open, where he lost to Greg Rusedski in 1997, and won all four major titles in doubles.
The Frenchwoman has joined Murray in Indian Wells this week, the first time they have been together at a tournament since the 27-year-old lost last month's Australian Open final to Novak Djokovic.
"I really like the way Amelie believes how Andy should play," said Bjorkman.
"He is at his prime time with his age, so he has some interesting years ahead of him.
"Andy is in a great situation right now, he has played some phenomenal tennis."
Bjorkman, who retired in 2008, is competing on Let's Dance, the Swedish version of Strictly Come Dancing.
