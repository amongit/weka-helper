Boxer Manny Pacquiao belts out ballad
Boxer Manny Pacquiao serenades the press with a rendition of "Sometimes When We Touch" with Canadian songwriter Dan Hill.
The song was a hit for Hill in the late 1970s and is apparently one of Pacquiao's favourite tunes.
Filipino Pacquiao is set to defend his WBO welterweight championship title on November 12 in Las Vegas against Mexico's Juan Manuel Marquez.
