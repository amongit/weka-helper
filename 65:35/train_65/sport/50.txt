Rangers ace Yu Darvish 'feeling great' after surgery
SURPRISE, Ariz. (AP) -- Texas Rangers ace Yu Darvish says he's ''feeling great'' after season-ending surgery on his right elbow and looks forward to coming back stronger than before.
Darvish is back in Arizona with the team and spoke Sunday for the first time since the elbow ligament-replacement procedure five days earlier in Florida.
''I am feeling great. I'm going to take this year to come back strong,'' Darvish said, holding up his right arm, which was in a cast.
The 28-year-old likely will be sidelined until early 2016.
An All-Star in each of his three seasons since arriving from Japan, Darvish was 10-7 with a 3.06 ERA in 22 starts last season. His final appearance was Aug. 9 because of elbow inflammation.
''When I had elbow problems last year, pitches weren't coming out the way I wanted,'' Darvish said. ''After I rehab, I'm going to come back stronger than before.''
