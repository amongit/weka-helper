Sebastien Loeb on top in qualifying for Wales Rally GB but WRC is proving to be a TV turn-off

Rallying, rivalling Formula One for the public’s attention a decade ago, has fallen so far off the radar that it’s difficult to find any coverage at all of the race formerly known as the RAC Rally.
A new deal with Red Bull to promote the series is in the offing — the last promoter having had its contract terminated at the start of the year after its parent company went into administration — but until then the WRC is surviving on slim pickings and little television coverage.
It hardly helps that Citroen’s Sebastien Loeb is dominating matters to an unhealthy degree.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, arguably the greatest driver in world motorsport, has picked up the last eight WRC titles and is on course for number nine this year. He won in Germany a fortnight ago — his fifth successive win — to establish a 54-point lead at the top of the championship over team mate Mikko Hirvonen.
Loeb already holds an advantage over his rivals this weekend, too, after a stroke of good fortune during yesterday’s qualifying stage at the Walters Arena complex. He managed to complete his run before rain that was in the air started to fall, pipping Ford’s Petter Solberg by five hundredths of a second and earning first choice of where to run on the road through tomorrow’s opening stages.

“I made one or two small mistakes but I am happy, it was not raining for me,” he said afterwards.
His Norwegian rival was left to rue his luck. “It’s unbelievable,” he said. “The rain tap is turned on again at the start line. I didn’t know what the grip would be like and I was braking too early for some of the corners. It’s frustrating but I still have one aim and that is to win.”
Matthew Wilson, Great Britain’s sole driver in the WRC class, qualified ninth fastest in his M-Sport Ford.
