Lewis Hamilton thanked fans from his private jet for voting him as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2014.
The 29-year-old had been runner-up for the BBC prize twice before. He looked to be heading for a hat-trick of near-misses with Rory McIlroy, the Northern Irishman who won two golf majors in 2014, a clear favourite.
But Hamilton won a third of the vote, following securing his second Formula One world title in November.
He said: "what an amazing year it's been. I'm so grateful for all the support, for everyone calling in.
"I just want to tell you that I love you, thank you so much".
