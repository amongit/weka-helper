Liverpool v Besiktas: Five things we learned at Anfield

1. Glen Johnson looks increasingly as though he is running down time on his Anfield career The England international, 30, is out of contract at the end of the season and no agreement has been reached on a new deal. Manager Brendan Rodgers has said he is keen to keep the experienced right-back on the books. But since a spell out injured either side of Christmas, Johnson has played in just two domestic cup ties and after sitting on the bench in recent games didn't make the squad.
2. Jordon Ibe is fast becoming part of Rodgers' current plans Lazar Markovic's European ban and Raheem Sterling's recent recovery from injury may have made the 19-year-old's selection more straight-forward but after being cup-tied for Liverpool's FA Cup win at Crystal Palace the winger was straight back in. A new long-term contract is in the pipeline and his confidence on the ball, quick feet and awareness of those around him again suggested he can already operate at the highest level.
3. Demba Ba will still just be remembered at Anfield for one thing
The former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea striker scored the fateful goal for Chelsea last April, following Steven Gerrard's slip, that set up a 2-0 win for Jose Mourinho's side that did irreparable damage to Liverpool's title hopes. Another goal would have added salt to the wound but from his one real chance Simon Mignolet made a fine save.
4. Liverpool are still a work in progress
Balotelli was right to take penalty, says Rodgers
Balotelli spot on to break Besiktas resistance
Ibe handed new Liverpool contract
Gerrard hits out at 'disrespectful' Balotelli
Their run of just defeat since December has helped banished the memories of a dreadful start to the season and they are still chasing a top-four Premier League finish and silverware via the FA Cup and Europa League. But Daniel Sturridge, their main goal threat, was playing his first European game for the club and without Sterling and the injured Steven Gerrard they lacked an extra cutting edge until Ibe's late run earned them the decisive penalty for Mario Balotelli to win it.
5. Liverpool have work to do in second leg
Liverpool are still far from guaranteed a place in the last 16 of the Europa League with a testing trip to Turkey to come in the second leg. Besiktas under Slaven Bilic, who has been talked about as a possible successor to Sam Allardyce at West Ham should they have a change this summer, were nothing like the side that lost 8-0 at Anfield in the Champions League eight years ago. They were disciplined, defensively strong and carried a threat going forward which they will need to overturn the 1-0 deficit.
Did you know Telegraph Sport has a ?
