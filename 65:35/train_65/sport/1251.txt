Louis van Gaal has picked up a referee’s whistle and taken to the training grounds at Manchester United this week in an attempt to help his team negotiate the hostility they can expect to encounter in one of English football’s most volatile fixtures on Sunday.

United visit Liverpool for a game that has produced 15 red cards in Premier League history – including four for former defender Nemanja Vidic alone – which leaves the fixture second only to the Merseyside derby and its 20 dismissals.
Taking a leaf out of the book of his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson, who was known for a similar approach, Van Gaal has played the role of match referee Martin Atkinson in training this week, deliberately provoking his players in an attempt to teach them to control their tempers and avoid adding to the red card statistic.
Van Gaal adopted the role of referee during training ahead of the trip to Anfield
“I’ve mentioned that to the players already,” said Van Gaal. “And I’ve refereed the games we have on the training pitch and I’ve whistled in a way they have to control their aggression, for example, to prepare them for the atmosphere. I’ve mentioned all this to the players after lunch because controlling your emotion is also a talent.”
Wayne Rooney, with six career red cards, is another player who will come under particular scrutiny on Sunday, given that he has scored just one goal in the past decade at Anfield – on his first appearance there with the club in 2005 – a career record of one goal in 745 minutes of play.

“I don’t think that Wayne has a block over that, no,” said Van Gaal when asked if Rooney has a mental problem at the ground. “He’s a very experienced player, he has played on all the grounds in the world so I don’t think that he shall be influenced by the fans at the stadium or something like that. But Liverpool, for Manchester United, is not a very easy ground so now I’m the manager here maybe we can change that.

“I had the same experience in the Netherlands as a manager. A player has it also. It’s strange because I’m not superstitious so we have to change that feeling also with Wayne. I have grounds where I never won as a manager or a player with a certain club. But then with another club I always won, for example. It’s strange but it can be like this – and I hope I can change it with Wayne.”

United could name the same line-up who beat Tottenham 3-0 last week. In addition, 33-year-old midfielder Michael Carrick goes into the game having signed a new, one-year contract extension on Friday.
“He is important,” said Van Gaal of Carrick. “He can read the game as a player on the pitch so he can coach during the game but he can improve that, I think. And he is also a midfielder who can play the ball forwards. And he is my vice captain.”
