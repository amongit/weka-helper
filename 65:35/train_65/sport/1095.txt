Zoe Smith, Team GB’s teenage weightlifting sensation, broke the British record in the 58kg contest at the London Olympics then joked that she is “just a little girl”.
Smith, 18, lifted 118kg - more than twice her own bodyweight - in the clean and jerk phase of the competition.
But this effort only placed her 12th in the women's 58kg, with China's Li Xueying taking the gold medal at ExCeL.
Smith said that despite the final result she was "over the moon" with the British record and she hoped that it would silence some of her critics.
"I hope that shuts them up to be honest," Smith said, adding, "they were saying that all female weightlifters look like blokes".
