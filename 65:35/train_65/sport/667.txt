Paul Pogba has ruled out a move back to the Premier League after signing a new contract with Juventus.
The France midfielder, who spent two years at Manchester United before leaving for Turin in 2011, had been strongly linked with a move back to Old Trafford, with other English clubs such as Chelsea also said to be keen.
But Pogba has now signed an extension which will keep him at the Serie A leaders until 2019.
