Soft Pretzel Recipes, Because You Need One (Or 20)
When a soft pretzel craving hits, there isn't much else that will satisfy it. You might think that your one option for making soft pretzels at home is to buy those terrible, plastic-smelling, frozen pretzels from the grocery store. If that's you, and you're stuck in that frame of mind, prepare yourselves because we're about to change your world.
Soft pretzel recipes are not as hard as you might think. They are one of those foods that are so ubiquitous at sporting events, movie theaters and the like, that we forget that they started out as a treat made at home. The best thing about making your own soft pretzels is that you determine the shape, size, taste, dipping situation, even filling. Happy cheese dunking, everyone.
