France 1 Spain 0: match report

Spain hope their post-World Cup revival will be inspired by a Chelsea striker, but they were left cursing Diego Costa’s Stamford Bridge deputy in Paris.
Loic Remy — signed as cover for the £32 million man — struck France’s winner in this friendly. While Costa fed off scraps before being substituted on 66 minutes, Remy pounced with 17 minutes to go to pose more questions about how the European champions will cope with the exodus of so many of their superstars.
Spain, returning to action for the first time since their surprisingly early World Cup exit, find themselves in the midst of an unlikely crisis. They have had to endure a full two years of hurt since winning their last trophy.
The inability to win a fourth consecutive major international tournament did not so much prompt dancing on the grave of 'tiki-taka’ as initiate a full-on summer rave at its tombstone. Despite another defeat, it still all seems rather premature.
With two consecutive European Championships bookending the 2010 World Cup, it might be wiser to wait and see if the events in Brazil were a blip rather than evidence of a long-term decline.

Their coach, Vicente Del Bosque, led his side into the Stade de France unveiling a change of personnel but reaffirming a familiar philosophy.
The former world champions do not need a revolution, just replenishing following the retirements of Xavi and Xabi Alonso. With Andres Iniesta also absent for the friendly in Paris, replacing one of the most technically gifted midfields in history was never going to be seamless but the world has not changed so much, despite the surprising malfunction in South America.
Didier Deschamps, the French coach gave the impression he’d been studying Spain’s defeat to Holland for the last three months, casting Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko in the Arjen Robben role and playing on the counter-attack.
When you’re blessed with such pace it is both a wise and risky strategy to sit back and wait to pounce, especially on your own turf when restless supporters quickly tire of the opponent monopolising the ball.
It is a plan that calculates there will eventually be an error or sloppy pass, and the problem for Spain is they have been more obliging than they used to be. Karim Benzema should have punished them on 26 minutes, miskicking tamely with only David De Gea to beat. The Real Madrid striker also had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside three minutes into the second half.
The French emerged in the second half energised but tor the most part, the fixture carried all the Spanish trademarks. Probing, patient — not always penetrative — but quite reassuring to all those who might have feared Del Bosque would ditch the refined approach. Although La Liga is considered the most superior technically in the world, there was a Premier League spine to his new-look line-up.
De Gea, Cesar Azpilicueta, Santi Cazorla, Cesc Fabregas and Costa all started, the striker offering a different dimension in attack.
In keeping with his season for Chelsea, Costa looks two yards quicker than at the World Cup and turned up with a much better rehearsed box of tricks than in June.
His presence enables Spain to send more crosses into the opposing penalty area, and there is a more occasional diagonal pass from 30 yards — anathema when Xavi and Alonso were dictating the tempo — to offer variety.
A Spanish redesign is not necessary nor desirable, however. You only have to look at France to see how flair can give way to pragmatism during a rebuilding process. Ten years ago it was the French academies that prompted rival countries to dispatch their scouts overseas, their pace and power evolving attacking football.
Now they have found satisfaction from a quarter-final appearance in Brazil based on containment football. An admirable achievement but still all rather drab when you recall the era of Zidane and Henry.
Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann have the potential to lift France back to those heights, but the shackles have not yet been released.
Presumably that is the next stage of Deschamps’ master plan.
He had too much respect to grant Spain space here, so there was a sterility about proceedings.
Remy’s appearance was the catalyst for a breakthrough. Found in space by the impressive Blaise Matuidi, Remy struck first time with his left foot. De Gea could only watch.
On balance France deserved their win for a much improved second half. The French look settled in their counter-attacking system, while Spain continue to pursue the cutting edge that once made them so flawless.
