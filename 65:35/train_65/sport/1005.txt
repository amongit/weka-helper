Now the race is on to make sure that it does not end up a glib catchphrase and that UK sport as a whole, from the grass roots to elite level, harnesses the euphoria.
National sporting bodies were yesterday reporting a huge upsurge in interest from members of the public keen to get either themselves or their children involved in sport.
Volleyball England said it had received 30 times the usual number of inquiries to its office and experienced an 850 per cent increase in traffic on its website over the past two weeks, with the two pages most searched “club finder” and “get into volleyball”.
“We have been delighted at the response from the Olympics and have received huge interest in people wanting to try volleyball and beach volleyball,” said Rob Harding, head of marketing and communications at Volleyball England.
“The sport is growing and we’d love to capitalise on the interest.”

Capitalise on Olympic spirit locally
With its GoSpike campaign, Volleyball England is one of a number of bodies encouraging free 'taster’ sessions at venues across the country as it seeks to increase interest and participation.
With funding from Sport England, it is also transporting more than 4,000 tons of sand from the temporary beach volleyball courts at Horse Guards Parade to sports venues across London and the South East.
Other 'minor’ sports such as taekwondo and sailing also reported increased levels of interest.
The Royal Yachting Association said that more than 150 people a day – nearly 3,000 by the end of the Games – took up the offer to try sailing and windsurfing for free from the beach in Weymouth, where the Olympic sailing regatta took place.
A spokesman said the RYA was working with clubs and centres to encourage as many 'have a go’ sessions and open days as possible.
It is typical of a more joined-up approach to legacy according to Natasha Quinn, of Sport England.
“A number of national governing bodies have set up grass-roots schemes to capitalise on the interest generated by the Olympics,” she said. “After the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 there was no signposting but lessons have been learnt. We’re far more prepared this time.”
Prime Minister David Cameron announced this week that UK Sport would receive around £125 million a year over the next four years of National Lottery and Exchequer funding and Tim Lamb, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said it was crucial money reached the grass roots where it is most needed.
“The challenge now is to deliver on the 'Inspire a Generation’ motto,” Lamb said. “Community clubs are where sport happens in this country and we need to make sure they get all the support they need to take advantage of the momentum.
“These are challenging times for clubs and they face all kinds of pressures thanks to the recession and thanks to countless bits of regulation. What the government must do now is make it as easy as possible for clubs to deliver on a legacy of participation.
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to translate the interest generated by the Games into a sustained increase in activity and that’s something many governing bodies have been preparing for since the Games were awarded to London in 2005.”
The call comes as thousands of local sports clubs and community groups prepare to offer free 'taster’ sessions this weekend.
Join In Local Sport, a charity-run initiative, is trying to get every sports club or community group in the UK to put on a special event or activity on Aug 18-19.
The comedian Eddie Izzard, who is backing the campaign, said: “We’ve already inspired a generation. Now is the time to make one weekend last a lifetime.”
So you’re inspired and want to try your hand at something new. How hard can it be? Telegraph Sport picked three sports at random and rang clubs near Reading.
Building the legacy: how to get involved
Picking three sports at random the Telegraph’s Tom Cary rang clubs near Reading.
Volleyball
Volleyball England’s website reveals my nearest club is in Newbury, some 15 miles away. Sue Sayers, club secretary and coach at Newbury Volleyball Club, answers.
The first two sessions are free, she says, and thereafter for under-18s it is £4 for two weekly sessions. Excellent value. For adults annual membership is £260 to play twice a week.
Taekwondo
There are a number of clubs in the area. I pick one at random — Reading Taekwondo — and owner/instructor Rob Morgan-Warren answers.
He’s had three or four enquiries today and a request from a school for a demo. He offers free taster sessions and then it’s £40 per month for adults.
Sailing
A quick search reveals 10 clubs within an eight-mile radius of Reading. Berkshire Sail Training offers taster sessions for £30, 50 per cent of which is deducted from any course you take. Five morning sessions are £121 and a four-day course £235.
