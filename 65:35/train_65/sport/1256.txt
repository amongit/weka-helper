In his hi-tech glass and chrome office in Stratford, east London, Dennis Hone, the chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), is jotting numbers on scraps of paper. Looking up, he points towards the Olympic Stadium, the jutting ArcelorMittal Orbit, the rolling lines of the Zaha Hadid-designed Aquatics Centre, and poses the question with which he and scores of others are now wrestling. 'Why would people cross the bridge, leave the comfort of retail therapy and go over to the park?’ he asks.
By Hone’s maths, there will be 9.3 billion visitors to London’s newest attraction, the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, by 2016. But on this bleak, overcast day the park’s appeal has fallen about as low as the unseasonal spring temperatures. The joy and ebullience of tens of thousands of spectators is long absent; the feats of athleticism, bravery and skill in the park’s various stadiums have given way to the mundane grind of giant earthmoving equipment and scores of purposeful men in hi-vis jackets. Not only do the Olympics and Paralympics seem a distant memory, so do many of the physical elements of this revitalised square mile in east London. Gone are the colossal wings of the Aquatic Centre, and the last of the basketball arena’s skeletal structure. Much of the park is already unrecognisable – not that many people are allowed to see it.

For the past 10 months wire fencing, patrolled 24 hours by security, has shrouded the site of the capital’s greatest modern triumph. It will remain there for the rest of this year, rendering much of the park off-limits to the public.
Yet inside, the long-term vision for this vast space is beginning to take shape. When it is completed there will be two new schools, 1.9 million square feet of retail and entertainment areas, 22 miles of cycle- and footpaths, nine miles of new roads and four miles of waterways – and five world-class sporting venues. To help ease London’s housing shortage there will be about 8,000 new homes. If you were lucky enough to have visited this part of town last summer you might struggle to get your bearings.

Hone admits that the site is going to feel very different, but so it should. 'The experience of the Games wasn’t about the physical buildings,’ he says. 'It was the banners, the way the park was dressed, the enthusiasm of the volunteers. And it was all for an event, for the 17 days of the Olympics and 12 days of the Paralympics. In the future the park has got to have many functions. We want it to have that magic we saw at the Olympics and Paralympics, but it can’t be a Disneyland with razzmatazz every day. It has to have days where it is tranquil, when people can walk the dog, fly a kite and have a picnic. Then on other days we want major events, to have it as a fantastic destination and visitor attraction. We want to get that balance right, and that is quite difficult.’

Some cities – notably Athens, Moscow and Beijing – failed to get the balance right once the Olympic circus left town. None of those cities seriously thought about what would happen to their arenas and facilities post-Games, or the huge costs of maintaining them.
Yet from the moment in July 2005 London won the right to host the 30th Olympiad, the most overused word associated with it has been 'legacy’. The constant refrain, from politicians to members of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the organising committee Locog, was that the park would have a vibrant life post-Games, which would benefit the local population and the country in general. The London Olympics would be the gift that kept on giving.
So far the only people reaping any financial reward from the London 2012 have been the owners and tenants of Westfield Stratford City, where £17 billion worth of transport links installed ahead of the Games have brought the public flocking in their thousands – to go shopping. The 1.88 million sq ft site saw £950 million of sales throughout 2012.
Westfield Stratford City was an enormous gamble for the Australian shopping centre magnate Frank Lowy but his investment has paid off handsomely. John Burton, Westfield’s director of development, says, 'Westfield [Stratford] has exceeded all expectations and attracted 8.5 million visitors over the Games period alone. In its first year of trading [it opened in September 2011] we had 47 million visitors, breaking all sales records for the company.’
Yet retail was only ever a small part of the 'legacy’ masterplan. Nearly two years ago that post-Olympic plan, known as the Legacy Community Scheme, was approved by the ODA. It had been an enormously complicated process, with eight different design codes to pass muster and 20 separate planning statements, yet had faced relatively muted opposition. It helped that the ODA acts as both the planning body and the consent authority, and that everything falls under the Mayor of London Boris Johnson’s control as the chairman of the LLDC.
The few voices of dissent that could be heard in advance of the Games have largely fallen silent. The majority of locals in the surrounding boroughs now acknowledge that the development has added much-needed investment and improved facilities to one of London’s most neglected areas. All of which has afforded the politicians on Johnson’s London Assembly and the LLDC’s board members – most of them business leaders – the freedom and flexibility to continue the transformation of the site.

In its promotional material the LLDC promises that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park 'will be the UK’s most exciting urban park, unlike any other park you have visited. Whatever your age, background or interests, here you’ll find something you’re into – from extraordinary new experiences to ordinary activities in extraordinary surroundings.’
The site will comprise two distinct areas, bisected by the newly constructed Waterden Road, the busy western access to Westfield Stratford City. The northern part of the park is centred on the Lee Valley, and will comprise lush landscaped parklands, a velopark (including a new mountain-bike course, and the revamped Olympic BMX track), a business district, hockey and tennis centres, and a recently-approved low-rise development of 850 homes, known as Chobham Manor, located where the temporary Olympic basketball arena stood. This section of the park is meant to be a relaxed, largely natural area that will be gated and shut to non-residents from dusk to dawn. The first residents of this area are expected to be in situ within the next two years.
Adjacent to the old media and broadcast centre, a development of 1,200-1,500 homes, called East Wick, may be fast-tracked in the next 12 months (ahead of its original five- to eight-year timescale) so that the entire northern park will be completed within a few short years. Already the business district is taking shape: the first tenant for the Olympic media centre, BT Vision, has moved in; the rest of the cavernous space is being leased through a business conglomeration named iCity, which is pursuing creative and digital companies for its £100 million redevelopment.
The area to the south of Waterden Road will have a more fast-paced feel, although the building work is progressing much more slowly. It is being developed around a plaza hub between the Olympic Stadium and the Aquatics Centre, and surrounded by high-rise housing. One of the South Plaza’s most anticipated commissions is a 55-acre landscaping project designed by the New York-based Briton James Corner, who was responsible for the acclaimed New York High Line, which transformed a section of derelict elevated railway in Manhattan into one of the city’s most popular new attractions. Corner’s London proposal is no less ambitious, with a wide tree-lined promenade branching out into areas designed for a variety of cultural activities, with carousels, climbing walls and picnic spots, and spaces for music and food festivals.
Yet many aspects of the South Plaza remain undecided, and previously agreed plans are being re-evaluated. There is growing speculation that some of the planned housing (a thousand or more homes) could be scrapped at the expense of other yet to be determined visitor attractions; a museum, a university and exhibition centres have all been mentioned.
According to Neale Coleman, the Mayor of London’s Olympic adviser and an LLDC board member, the Legacy Community Scheme always allowed for a degree of flexibility. The planners, he adds, can now afford to be more ambitious because, in short, last summer exceeded everyone’s expectations. 'The Games were so successful, the transport worked so well and people have experienced the park, and so they are starting to accept that Stratford is part of central London,’ he says. 'It has completely changed the perception of the area.’

While the planners keep an open mind significant questions remain unanswered, not least regarding the total cost of the park, how much of it is coming from the public purse, and when it will all be finished. The park’s website still states that 'the transformation project to turn the Olympic site into Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park started straight after the end of the Games and is anticipated to take 18 months’. However, the planning application section of the LLDC’s website paints a more long-term picture, stating that 'the redevelopment... is to be phased over a considerable period of time, spanning roughly 25-30 years’.
The park will host its first major events since last summer at the end of this month, starting with the music festival Hard Rock Calling, headlined by Bruce Springsteen. 'We’ll go from bulldozers to the Boss,’ Dennis Hone says with a smile.
A few weeks later the Olympic Stadium will host the London Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games, three days of Diamond League athletics action featuring a number of A-list Olympic stars including Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah. But other sections of the south park will take many years to complete. According to the most recent schedule the last of the park’s houses are not due to be finished until 2030, although Neale Coleman now says that residents could be moving in a decade sooner.

Boris Johnson, sensing rumblings of impatience, has insisted the public facilities of the park be reopened as quickly as possible, which is why a middle third of the park – incorporating the Olympic handball arena, the Copper Box (London’s third-largest arena), and reworked garden areas down to the river – will be opened in July, six months ahead of schedule.
But it will be next January before the velodrome is in action for club cycling competitions (before becoming a national training centre) and the middle of next year before the Aquatics Centre will welcome its first public swimmers. Although it is hoped that the first residents will move into what was once the athletes’ village in September, the renamed East Village is currently still being retrofitted with kitchens.
About half of the 2,800-plus homes have been earmarked for affordable housing – part of Hone’s commitment that 30 per cent of all housing on the park be affordable (a third of that will be social rent, a third shared ownership, and the rest available at 80 per cent market price). This hasn’t stopped low-income earners in nearby Newham raising concerns that they may be priced out of the new accommodation.
Some would argue that a greater cause for concern is that the remaining East Village homes were sold in late 2011 to Qatari Diar, the ruling family of Qatar’s development company, for £557 million in a deal which has left British taxpayers, who had contributed the equivalent of £800 million for requisition of the land and construction costs, out of pocket by over £200 million.

Hone, an accountant by trade, believes that the money will be easily recouped in profitmaking sales of other future development plots on the Olympic Park but he is acutely aware of the need to balance the books. The government purse contributed more than £7 billion to the construction and infrastructure of Olympic Park out of the total £9.3 billion cost of hosting the Games (the rest went largely towards security and transport) and part of Hone’s job now is to ensure that, in legacy, that was money well spent. Which in the middle of a recession and with rising costs has not been easy.
It was always the case that £300 million of taxpayers’ money would be spent reshaping the park after the Games, but the final budget looks like being more than double that amount. The Government has already allocated a further £150 million, but more will be needed.
Furthermore, £650 million must be returned to the government’s Big Lottery Fund which was drawn down when the initial plans to have private enterprise pay for the vast media centre and athletes village went belly-up with the recession, and there is also the £10 million a year Boris Johnson has pledged to set aside in upkeep for the park.
'Ideally the park would pay for itself,’ John Biggs, the local Labour politician who also oversees the London Assembly’s budget committee, says. 'I would be disappointed if it costs a great deal. The park has to generate its own income.’ That means, among other things, selling the naming rights to venues, and charging the public to use them.
West Ham United will become tenants of the Olympic Stadium (Jason Orton)
The arrival of Premier League football will bring much-needed cash into the park. Last month, after delays, confusion and legal threats, the 99-year tenancy of the £429 million Olympic Stadium was granted to West Ham United. It came with a proviso that the stadium be modified, with £200 million of new retractable seating, so that it can still serve its original purpose as an athletics venue (it will host the 2017 World Athletics Championships). To get the deal over the line the Government contributed another £25 million; Newham Council put in £40 million.
Hone said the West Ham deal was 'an important milestone’ and showed that 'we remain firmly on track to deliver a meaningful physical and social legacy for Londoners’. That means the park is on its way to becoming a place Londoners – and people from all over the world – will want to visit.
'We want people to have a cluster of reasons to go there on a wet windy February afternoon,’ Hone tells me as we look out of his office window. 'If we build houses for them, that might be the solution, but we need other things – cultural things, educational things, rich sporting offers, clubs, cafes, bars, so that once it’s there it will be there for 50 years. I don’t think people understand how exciting the park will be once it’s finished.’
