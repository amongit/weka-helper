Heather Watson was laid low today by an attack of physical lassitude that struck at the worst possible time at the Australian Open. She interrupted her match against Tsvetana Pironkova to receive visits from the doctor and the trainer, and wolfed down as many energy gels as she could find in her bag, but her legs remained as heavy as lead piping.
Watson’s 6-4, 6-0 defeat was all the more disappointing because she came to Melbourne on the back of a superb run in Hobart, where she claimed her second WTA title and thus forced her way up to a career high of No. 38 in the world.
Had she been able to maintain that level of play against Pironkova, who stands just outside the top 50, the result would surely have been a place in the second round against Dominika Cibulkova, the 11th seed.
But Watson’s natural dynamism was sucked away by her physical condition, which she described as “just one of those things, one of those days … I get this at different times.” Happily, those around her confirmed that it was not a recurrence of the glandular fever which struck her down at this tournament two years ago, even if the doctor who treated her on the court happened to be the same man whom she had consulted then.
“I just felt kind of bloated and weak and not that good,” Watson explained after the match. “I struggled on the court to have energy and against any player here you can’t be like that. It’s tough enough when you’re fit.

“I have a day or two here and there where I feel like this. It’s unfortunate that it’s come today but I didn’t cope well with it. Pironkova took advantage. I kind of wish that I’d played Monday but what can I do?”
From a British perspective, Watson’s match had looked the most likely to generate a win today, because the two male players in action – James Ward and Kyle Edmund – were up against much higher-ranked opponents. Both men did indeed fall in the first round, although Ward could take encouragement from the way he tested the 2013 Wimbledon semi-finalist Fernando Verdasco, dominating the first set before going out by a 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 scoreline. Edmund, though, lost in straight sets 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 to Steve Johnson.
Meanwhile, tournament favourite Novak Djokovic opened his Australian Open campaign against a man who could well be playing under the Union Jack flag in a few weeks’ time. Aljaz Bedene, a Slovenian who is waiting for his British citizenship papers to come through, put up a decent fight before succumbing 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. The work he is doing at the Gosling Tennis Academy in Hertfordshire looks likely to boost Bedene – who is now ranked No. 116 – back into the top 100 soon.
