Indian Wells: Andy Murray equals Tim Henman career win record

Andy Murray equalled Tim Henman's Open-era record for career wins by a British man as he advanced to the quarter-finals at Indian Wells.
Murray beat unseeded Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-3 6-3 in what was the first meeting between the pair.
The Scot will play Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the last eight.
Murray said he "wasn't aware" he had equalled Henman's record of 496 career wins, joking: "It's probably one of the few records Tim still had over me."
Fourth seed Murray took the opening set in 45 minutes, winning the last four games in a row after losing serve.
He then sealed victory over the left-handed world number 38 in one hour 29 minutes to set up a meeting with Lopez, whobeat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6 (7-2).
Mannarino's deceptive punchy style, executed with a short backswing, presented difficulties for Murray in the warm Californian morning sun and a double fault ensured the Scot was first to lose serve in the fifth game.
He broke back immediately with some high quality returns and quickly claimed the opening set, the first lost in the tournament by Mannarino, who beat 14th seed Ernests Gulbis 6-4 6-4 in the previous round.
Murray, at 27 a year older than his opponent, was unable to convert four break-point opportunities in the first game of the second set but broke to love in the fifth.
With Mannarino unable to maintain his impressive early level of performance, Murray, the 2009 runner-up, secured his fifth quarter-final spot at the event.
"He's playing very well this year, he's got a very tricky game, quite hard to read, moves very well and has good hands but in both sets he played one or two loose games which helped me," Murray said.
