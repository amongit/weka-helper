NBA Draft 2012 Round 2 RESULTS: Bernard James, Robbie Hummel Among Second Round Picks
As is NBA Draft tradition, the second round began with enthusiastic cheers as Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver replaced his antagonistic boss, David Stern, at the podium.
Round Two of the 2012 NBA Draft featured surprises, players from overseas and, of course, some more Kentucky Wildcats.
Charlotte got the second act of the 2012 Draft started by selecting Vanderbilt's Jeff Taylor with the 31st overall pick. A few minutes later, the crowd provided one of the most touching moments of the night, chanting "U-S-A!" as Florida State's Bernard James -- a former soldier in the U.S. Air Force -- made his way to the stage after being selected with the 33rd pick by Cleveland (he was later traded to Dallas).
National champions Doron Lamb and Darius Miller were also taken in the second round, making Kentucky the first school ever in the two-round era to have six players selected in one draft.
