MAIN STADIUM The centrepiece venue will receive its biggest and final test before the Olympic opening ceremony this week, with four days of competition in the British University and Colleges Athletics Championship on the track from Friday, and an “entertainment event” watched by 40,000 people on Saturday night.
The performance, which will mark 2,012 hours until the Olympics, is crucial to the stadium being granted a safety licence for its 80,000 Games-time capacity.
Newham Council will have to be satisfied that the management of crowds and various safety elements are handled well. James Bulley, the director of venues and infrastructure for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, said every aspect of the stadium would be tested.
“We are testing all the operational areas for ticketing, entry and exits, the kiosks that we have opened up for the first time for food and drink, the toilets, the merchandising.
“We are also in full athletics set-up, so all the sports equipment has to be installed, the hammer cage and such like, the broadcast and press camera positions, mixed zones and the like.

“Our teams have one opportunity to test with 40,000 people in the stadium before we lock-down on May 12 to begin preparations for the opening ceremony.”
WATER POLO The Cube, a temporary venue with a capacity of 5,000, took its bow yesterday, with four international women’s teams, including Great Britain, getting their first experience of the water before a tournament starting Thursday.
With most fans sitting in a steep-rake of black seats on one side of the asymmetric building it will be intimate and could create a raucous atmosphere. Water polo does not always have its own area at the Olympics, having to make do with a home in the middle of a main 50-metre pool, and the players are enthused by the prospect.
“We are just excited to be here,” said Fran Leighton, the captain of the GB team, staring up at the main grandstand. “There’s going to be a massive crowd which we are just not used to. It is going to take a bit of concentration to keep your eye on the game rather than looking up to the gods, but seeing it full of British fans will be fabulous.”
The venue is trialling some innovations which it hopes will be adopted by the world governing body for use in the Games. These include coloured light strips across the bottom of the pool to delineate the five-metre area and around the major box (sin-bin). They hope these will make the game easier to follow and more dramatic.
RIVERSIDE ARENA, HOCKEY The 60,000 tickets for the men’s and women’s invitational hockey tournament sold out within 14 minutes.
The distinctive blue-and-pink pitches are staging their first competitive action as Great Britain’s women take on world champions Argentina, China and Korea and the men Australia, Germany and India.
As with all the venues, the test event is a chance to recreate Games-time operations for volunteers and staff. Venues are split into distinct zones, with players and officials separate from media, who in turn are separated from spectators.
The pitches are still bedding in, and the Australian team have complained about the surface being slippery, but there was excitement among players and officials as the first spectators filtered in on Wednesday morning.
“It is absolutely fantastic to be here just a few weeks out from the Games,” said Andy Halliday, the GB men’s team manager. “We are staying in a hotel in Westfield, and to open the curtains and see the park laid out is unbelievable when six years ago the same view was a wasteland. It is part of the journey to the Games for us to come here, play and get a sense of what the place will feel like with 16,000 people in here.”
PUBLIC REALM This week’s test events are the only opportunity for Locog to test how it operates the public areas in the Olympic Park. With several venues in use there will be 140,000 spectators passing through during the next five days, peaking at 75,000 on Saturday. In addition there will be 11,000 staff and volunteers and 3,000 athletes and coaches on site.
“This is a really important week for us not just to test individual facilities and their operations, but also how we operate the park as an overall zone,” said Paul Deighton, chief executive of Locog.
“We need to see people moving around, how people come in and out, the security process, the last mile between the transport hubs and the security gates.
A crucial area is that surrounding the main stadium, which is close to the spectator gate through which more than 70 per cent of spectators will pass during the Games.
“Egress from the main stadium is one of the main things we will be looking at this week. How people get out, how much time they spend in the park afterwards, how they queue.
“It’s also an opportunity to test the communications between our Park operations team on site and our main operations centre back in Canary Wharf, which handles operations across all the venues.”
SECURITY
Getting large crowds in and out of the Olympic Park several times a day is the major logistical challenge for Locog and one that will be tested thoroughly over the coming days.
With multiple sessions across four venues in the park it is the closest organisers will get to Games conditions. Locog’s solution to the need to carry out airport-style checks on all spectators is manpower. Up to 62 security lanes will be used this week, with as many as 162 during the Games.
Despite this Lord Coe, the London 2012 chairman, warned there would be queuing, and even familiar venues would take longer to access.
“We are testing spectator flows and systems this week but yes, there will be some queuing,” Coe said. “Part of our communication here is really important. Whether it is the Olympic Park, or Wimbledon or football grounds, these are not ordinary championships. For example, if I go to Stamford Bridge I might build in 20 minutes, perhaps less, to get in and out of the stadium.
“But if you go to the Olympic football, build in more time, it will take longer than normal, particularly if you are benchmarking against Wimbledon or Lord’s or Wembley.
“There is an added tier of security, we have no appetite for risk, but that is what we are testing and we are working to minimise the amount of disruption.”
