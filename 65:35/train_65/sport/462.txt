Joy Robson, 50, from the Isle of Skye, was killed in the incident at the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally, in Glenurquhart Forest near Loch Ness, on Saturday.
An eight-year-old boy was also taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, although police said that his condition was not believed to be life-threatening.
The Highland Car Club Snowman Rally in Glenurquhart Forest, near Loch Ness, was abandoned and emergency services attended the scene.
Neither the driver or the co-driver of the rally car was injured in the incident and no other spectators were hurt.
Northern Constabulary said initial reports suggested a car left the track during stage one of the event, and hit spectators.
