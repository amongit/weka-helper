12.32 Former Arsenal striker Sylvain Wiltord has described his horror at the crash.
Wiltord, who was not on either of the helicopters after being eliminated from the programme the day before the crash, tweeted his shock at the events this morning, saying: "I'm sad for my friends, I'm trembling, I'm horrified, I have no words, I don't want to say anything."
A fortnight ago, he posted onto his Instagram account this photo of himself with Alexis Vastine.

12.03 The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has put out a statement.
We are shocked by this sad news. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of these great athletes who have left us.
With them, the world of sport and the Olympic family have lost three of their key members. They were all not only champions in their sport but also contributed greatly as role models.
The Olympic movement mourns with their families and friends, their fellow athletes, the French National Olympic Committee and with France.
The Olympic flag will be flown at half-mast for three days at the IOC Headquarters to honour these great champions.
11.34 According to Gabriel Gonzalez, who was standing nearby, the helicopter from La Rioja was suspended in the air, and the one from Santiago del Estero was testing its cameras flying alongside, and they knocked into each other.

El de la LR habría estado suspendido en el aire, el de Santiago del Estero hacia una prueba de cámaras volando a la vuelta y se tocaron.
11.26 French tennis star Henri Leconte said he was "shocked and devastated" by the news, "even more so because they contacted me to take part but I couldn't".
What's unbelievable is that Florence Arthaud almost died several times on her boat. In the end, she died like that.
Teddy Riner, the French seven-times world judo champion and a friend of Alexis Vastine, also had wanted to take part but "couldn't find two weeks free in my diary".
It looked fun, that's why it attracted so many sports people.
It just goes to show that life only hangs by a thread. Now what's for sure is they can forget it. I will never take part in such a show.
He said the news had made him "want to vomit".
11.16 Florence Arthaud gave an interview recently in which she spoke of her life.
I lived life in the fast lane.
It’s not a women’s profession, it’s a universe that is very tough and hard.
Above all you are constantly on the water, at least we were in my time: we didn’t have a house, we had nothing but just lived on our boats all the time with a big group of friends who were our family. I only had my daughter at 36. Before I didn’t have a "woman’s life", I lived life in the fast lane and was an adventurer.
The boats were much tougher before. I had a 24.5m catamaran whose mainsail weighed 200kg and had no furler. The boats were much too hard. With today’s technique, a boat of 31 or 40m is no harder to pilot that our catamarans of 26m.

11.02 Gabriel Gonzalez was 100m away from the helicopters as they crashed.
He said that there were 50 police on the scene very quickly, but they could do nothing for the victims as the helicopters burst into flames immediately.
He says:
"A terrible accident. Two helicopters crashed in Villa Castelli.
"Nothing could be done for the passengers. The two helicopters were in flames. Supposedly a woman got out."
It was later confirmed that no one survived the crash.
Finally, he says:
"The fire from the helicopter of the province (La Rioja) has been extinguished."

10.55 From Paris, Henry Samuel writes:
Florence Arthaud, a flamboyant figure with a penchant for partying while on dry land, was something of an feminist icon.
Maud Fontenoy, a female French solo round-the-world sailor, said: "Florence Arthaud opened something in the hearts of many women."
Arthaud signed a petition in today's Libération newspaper calling for gender equality to become a reality and entitled: "If you're a man."
François Hollande, the French president, expressed his “stupor and emotion” at the deaths. Speaking of the fallen sports stars, he said:
They died because they wanted to push the boundaries.
Florence Arthaud served as a model for a generation of women, and men too, to go further, to defy both the elements and other competitors. She was able to surpass herself. Florence Artaud was an example of freedom and commitment."
Camille Muffat was a “great champion who had numerous medals, notably in London,” he said, remembering personally handing her the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur” – among France’s most prestigious awards.
Alexis Vastine, he went on, was “full of talent.”
At one stage, his sporting career was broken as he could have been Olympic champion twice. He also carried the flag for the defence ministry. He died because he wanted to show young people that they should never despair, never give up, and always go further, including defying referees that didn’t recognise him as champion.
10.50 This is the trailer for Dropped - a show which is filmed around the world.
You can see why the Olympians would be inspired to take up the challenge.

10.31 Argentine newspaper Clarin reports that the two helicopters were lent to the producers to entice them to the region, in order to promote tourism.
From September 23rd - 27th last year the producers of Dropped filmed in the same area, in the Quebrada del Yeso - a spectacular, almost lunar, district of canyons and red rocks.
10.28 The ten victims of the crash have been named as:
Argentine pilots:
Roberto Abate and Juan Carlos Castillo
French TV crew:
Laurent Sbasnik
Lucie Mei-Dalby
Volodia Guinard
Brice Guilbert
Edouard Gilles
French reality show contestants:
Camille Muffat
Alexis Vastine
Florence Arthaud

10.24 From Paris, Henry Samuel writes:
This is second tragedy to hit French reality TV in two years.
In 2013, Gerald Babin, a contestant on Koh Lanta, the French version of Survivor also on the TF1 channel, died of a heart attack while taking part in the programme on a desert island in Thailand.
Like Dropped, the Koh Lanta show was produced by Adventure Line Productions (ALP), which lost five employees in the Argentina crash.
Shortly after Babin's death, the show’s doctor, Thierry Costa, committed suicide, leaving a note saying he had been unfairly criticised over the death of a contestant.
Some media outlets had carried reports criticising the amount of time it took for anyone to treat Babin, 25, after his collapse.
ALP, the producers, said at the time that Costa's suicide should "encourage those who accuse and comment indiscriminately to exercise responsibility".
10.22 The accident happened at 17.15 on Monday, when the two Eurocopter AS350s collided mid-air.
They had just taken off from the tarmac at Bella Vista club, in Villa Castelli - a town in the province of La Rioja, towards the border with Chile.
10.20 The two Argentine pilots have been named as Roberto Abate and Juan Carlos Castillo.
Investigators will be looking into events to see whether the accident was a result of pilot error, mechanical failure, or the weather conditions.
10.10 The three Olympians who were killed were much-loved in France.
• Sailor Florence Arthaud, 57, made sporting history and became a female icon in 1990 after becoming the first woman to win the Route du Rhum, the prestigious solo Atlantic race. It earned her the enduring nickname of “fiancée of the Atlantic”.
• Swimmer Camille Muffat, 25, won gold in the 400m freestyle in the 2012 London Olympics, and added a silver medal in the 200-metre freestyle and a bronze in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay.
• Boxer Alexis Vastine, 28, won bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the light-welterweight category.
You can read more about the trio here.
10.05 An investigation has been opened in Paris for manslaughter over the helicopter crash.
10.03 Camille Muffat's boyfriend, William Forgues, 26, said her agent broke the news to him overnight. He then drove to her parents.
He told itele:
They didn't know. You can imagine the scene. It was 1.30am, you ring the bell and they find such a thing out. It was terrible.
The most important thing to know is that often people called Camille "Madame 100 per cent" because she succeeded in almost everything she did. She went (to Argentina) very happy in every way. She chose to do this TV programme and loved it. She was where she wanted to be and the rest, c'est la vie.

09.57 The two helicopters were flying low, around 100m above the ground and very close to each other so the cameramen in each aircraft could film the rival teams in the air, according to Le Figaro's correspondent in Argentina. The helicopters took off just five metres apart, according to local media.
Eye witnesses cited by local media said one of the helicopters hit the other's tail, causing the damaged craft to crash. It plummetted to the bottom of a cliff, hampering reocvery attempts, reported Le Parisien. The first craft then caught fire and exploded in mid-air.
Local authorities, the helicopters were in excellent condition and weather conditions were fair.
09.44 More from Henry Samuel, who is following the story for us from Paris.
Tributes from fellow sportsmen and women are flooding in.
Laure Manaudou, the French Olympic swimming champion, wrote:
All my thoughts are with Camille, Alexis and Florence and the others. Tragic. They have made France and sport greater.
Second tragedy for the family of Alexis Vastine this year, as his sister died in a car crash two months ago.
He reportedly agreed to take part in the reality show to try and take his mind off her death.
09.43 To give you an idea of where the crash happened, AFP have just created this map:

09.38 “The whole of France is in mourning,” said Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, this morning.
France will organise a special tribute for the fallen sports champions and all those who died in the helicopter crash, said Patrick Kanner, the French sports minister.
09.24 France is in mourning after the death of three much-loved sporting personalities in a helicopter crash in Argentina, writes Henry Samuel in Paris.
Florence Arthaud, 57, made sporting history and became a female icon in 1990 after becoming the first woman to win the Route du Rhum, the prestigious solo Atlantic race. It earned her the enduring nickname of “fiancée of the Atlantic”.
Aged 8, she revelled in the victory of Frenchman Eric Tabarly in the Observer Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, ending years of Anglo-American domination. It felt like “revenge” for Napoleon’s defeats at the hands of admiral Horatio Nelson, she would later say.
She has had several brushes with death; a serious car accident put her in a coma when she was 17, while in 2011 she fell off her yacht off Corsica and was only saved thanks to her waterproof mobile phone. Picked up two hours later, she said: “My day hadn’t come. True miracles have happened.”
Camille Muffat, 25, won gold in the 400m freestyle in the 2012 London Olympics, and adding a silver medal in the 200-metre freestyle and a bronze in the 4 by 200-metre freestyle relay. A shy and unassuming champion, she first made a name for herself by beating her idol, French Olympic champion Laure Manaudou, at a medley event aged just 15. She retired from swimming last year to focus on her personal life.
Alexis Vastine, 28, won bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the light-welterweight category. He was narrowly beaten in the quarter-finals of the 2012 Games, famously shedding tears at his defeat to Manuel Felix Diaz, after he was docked points by the referee in the final round – a decision many observers questioned.
Frustration struck again at the London Olympics, when he missed out on a medal after drawing on points in the quarter-finals but then losing on a complex countback rule. The hot-tempered Frenchman punched the ring with his naked fist, before once again breaking down in tears. “This is politics, not sport,” he later said.
He was determined to have another crack at Olympic gold in 2016.
08.52 Christian Estrosi, Nice mayor, has paid tribute to swimmer Camille Muffat, an Olympic gold medalist from Nice.

08.47 The series, which was to air on French television channel TF1, involved eight sports stars being dropped into inhospitable environments for an adventure- and survival-themed reality show.
One of the helicopters was provided by the provincial government and the other by the police force in the neighbouring province of Santiago del Estero.

08.45 Four members of the production staff were also killed, named as Laurent Sbasnik, Lucie Mei-Dalby, Volodia Guinard, Brice Guilbert and Edouard Gilles, as well as the two Argentine pilots Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate.
In total, eight French nationals were killed in the crash, along with two Argentine helicopter pilots.
08.40 "The sudden death of our fellow French nationals is a cause of immense sadness," a statement from French President Francois Hollande's office in Paris said.
"The whole of French sport is in mourning because we have lost three huge champions," Sports Minister Thierry Braillard told RTL radio.
"Florence Arthaud – we all knew her as the 'Fiancee of the Atlantic'," he added, using Arthaud's nickname.
The scene of the crash
08.31 Three French sports stars – Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat, yachtswoman Florence Arthaud and boxer Alexis Vastine – were among 10 people killed when two helicopters collided in Argentina on Monday during the filming of a reality TV show.
Authorities said it was still unclear what caused the accident in the rugged western province of La Rioja near the Andes mountains.
