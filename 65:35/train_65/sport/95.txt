Australian boxer dies 2 days after collapsing after fight
BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- A 23-year-old boxer died Monday two days after losing consciousness after losing a 10-round featherweight bout.
Family spokesman James O'Shea confirmed Braydon Smith, who was in the final year of a law degree, had been in an induced coma at a Brisbane hospital since collapsing 90 minutes after a WBC Asian Boxing Council continental title bout with John Moralde of the Philippines on Saturday.
Smith lost in a unanimous points decision, before praising his opponent and congratulating Moralde on the win and then returning to his dressing room.
O'Shea said Smith was alert and talkative immediately following the bout before collapsing.
