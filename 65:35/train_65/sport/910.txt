Most mothers with a four-year-old and a 10-month-old can be found with a wild-eyed stare, struggling to keep up with a deluge of nappies and washing while attempting to maintain a semblance of sanity.
Jo Pavey, on the other hand, was winning the 10,000m gold medal at the 2014 European Championships in Zurich.
That’s just one reason why I believe she should be crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year this Sunday evening.
SPOTY is usually dominated by men – famously in 2011 they didn’t even bother to put a woman on the shortlist.
And this year the three favourites are men – Rory McIlroy, Lewis Hamilton and Gareth Bale.
Jo Pavey won gold for running, not giving birth. Ok BBC?

But women everywhere should be voting for Pavey – the European champion runner and mum-of-two, who stands head and shoulders above these young men.
Her victory in Zurich made her the oldest female European champion in history at the age of 40 years and 325 days.
She’s an inspiration to mums who often struggle to get their lives back on track after having children. Four out of five women feel guilty about returning to work after having children. Almost half of all mums have to take on lower-paid, less skilled jobs when they return to work after maternity leave.
Pavey proves to the world that women are just as valuable, if not more so, after having children.
This year she also won a heroic bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, breaking the world record for women over 40 by almost 12 seconds.
Afterwards she said: "The fact I've got two kids and my youngest is only ten months old feels almost comical to me.
"To be out there trying to race against the Kenyans and get a medal is like a dream – hopefully I can inspire some mums to get fit.

"My little boy was watching – it was so great to give him a hug after the race. The fact I'm 40 now makes this medal seem almost funny.
"I haven’t been on any training camps, I was still breast-feeding at the start of April. Being a mum is my main thing now.
"It seems funny being out there – now changing nappies and doing meals means I don’t have a minute to relax."
Now that’s inspirational – and it’s something all mums can relate to.
Pavey has also overcome a series of serious injuries and illness, which has afflicted her career.
She was a promising junior and her first UK national title came at 1500m in 1997. Injuries almost ended her ambitions but she has still managed to represent Great Britain in every Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.
Before this year, she has come oh-so close to winning medals on the world stage, finishing fourth in the 10,000m at the 2007 World Championships and fifth in the 5,000m at the 2004 Olympic Games. In London 2012 she was seventh in both the 5000m and 10000m at the London 2012 Olympic Games. She was the first European in both races with the top six places in the 5000m all going to Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes.
Moreover Pavey is the only female athlete in the modern era to have competed over 1500m, 5000m and 10000m at an Olympic Games and World Championships.
Now aged 41, she’s got her sights set firmly on Rio, which would be her fifth Olympic Games. For a woman who ran up to three weeks before the birth of her daughter and started training again seven weeks after her C-section, age should be no barrier.
Yes, I know Rory McIlroy and Lewis Hamilton are the favourites. Oh please. To me driving round and round in circles does not qualify you to have a personality. F1 is not so much a sport as a willy-waving contest. And where does Our Lewis live? Monaco, obviously, that well known tax haven. I can’t imagine why. Must be the weather.
Then there’s McIlroy, who plays one of the few sports involving a ball which challenges F1 in terms of tedium.
No, if you want real personality, determination and grit, look no further than Pavey – who happens to live in a market town in Devon, and trains with her husband and two small children in tow.
