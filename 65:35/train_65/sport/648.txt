David Moyes has refuted suggestions that Manchester United are a declining force and claims that an “incredible” number of leading players want to sign for the club.
Ahead of the crucial trip to Chelsea today, a bullish United have also brushed off claims by Jose Mourinho that they will consider selling Wayne Rooney to an overseas club in the summer.
Club sources said Mourinho was simply showing his frustration at not being able to sign Rooney last year and insisted that the striker would be offered a new deal before the end of this campaign. He has one more year after this season on his present deal.
Chelsea host United at Stamford Bridge today with the champions still attempting to come to terms with life after the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Mourinho claimed in an interview last week that United were “probably too late to win the league” although he claimed later that they could still be a threat.
If United lose it will further raise fears that they will not only relinquish their title but fail to finish in the top four and fail to qualify for the Champions League for the first time, putting their ability to attract new players under scrutiny. But Moyes brushed aside concerns over United’s current predicament and insisted that the club remained a significant attraction for leading players.

“Manchester United are not only the biggest club in this country, they are the biggest club in the world,” Moyes said. “I don’t think any of the aura is fading whatsoever. I think some of the results have been not what you want, but I don’t think the aura is fading; in fact, I actually think the opposite.
“I don’t see an issue when it comes to signing players, not judging by my trips and the things I’m hearing. The amount of big players who want to join United is incredible. Maybe players want to go for the money to other clubs, but if you asked them where they really want to be, what club they’d really like to wear the badge of, they want to wear the badge of Manchester United. Players are not looking at the share price. What they’re looking at is the club, what it stands for in football terms.”
There is pressure on Moyes to be active in the January transfer window but it is understood that he would prefer to try to wait until the summer before a major overhaul of his squad.
One deal that has, once again, stalled is a loan move for left-back Fabio Coentrao with Real Madrid resisting fresh attempts from his agent Jorge Mendes to secure a switch to Old Trafford. Real say they will sell Coentrao for around £20 million but only once they have first secured a replacement.
Moyes and Woodward are believed to be lining up a number of deals for the summer. Moyes and his staff made extensive scouting trips around Europe last week and the club are believed to be confident that they will be able to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan in the summer.
The 23-year-old has a £23 million release clause in his contract, which runs until 2015, and talks have been opened with United.
Moyes has still to make a decision on Wilfried Zaha’s future, with the young winger rarely in contention and a loan target for Cardiff and Crystal Palace, his former club, among others. Midfielder Anderson yesterday joined Fiorentina on loan until the end of the season.
