The spirit of Elena Baltacha lives on through the next generation of tennis players

I can’t think of a better tribute to my friend and team-mate Elena Baltacha – ‘Bally’ as we all knew her – than the fact that, thanks to her, children are learning to love tennis the way she did.
The Elena Baltacha Foundation charity, largely thanks to the money raised by the Rally For Bally fundraising matches in June, has introduced tennis to more than 3,000 children in the past four months. Many of those are from deprived backgrounds and would never have had the chance to play had it not been for Bally.
The kids are taught to work hard, be disciplined, have fun and, above all, to give 100 per cent commitment to everything they do because that’s exactly the way that Bally went about her tennis and her life.
Only now is it clear how much she must have struggled with her chronic liver condition throughout her career, because she never moaned about anything. By reaching the top 50, playing on the WTA Tour and representing her country, Bally achieved so much more than anyone could have expected of someone with her health problems – yet she always expected more from herself.
I first met Bally when we were eight or nine years old. She had red hair and huge glasses and she whacked every ball that came her way as hard as she could. Bish bash, that was Bally. The no-nonsense attitude was there off court as well. We were almost exactly the same age and it proved to be the start of a shared journey, from junior squads and trips to tournaments to taking our first steps on the professional circuit, playing Fed Cup together, vying for British No 1 and eventually representing Great Britain together at the London 2012 Olympics.

One of my best memories was when we were both about 16, sharing a room during a big junior tournament near Miami called the Orange Bowl. We had been to see a movie, Coyote Ugly, and when we got back we spent all night trying to re-create a dance routine from the film, staying up until the early hours to get the footwork right. As always, Bally wouldn’t give up.
Later, as our tennis got more serious, we lost our camaraderie and we did grow apart. We were both desperate to succeed and be British No 1 and although we would never have admitted it at the time, the fierce rivalry we had made us both better players. It took years for us to rediscover our friendship but it was wonderful when we did.
We were playing Fed Cup and by then we were senior players on the team, compared to youngsters Laura Robson and Heather Watson. Bally just sat next to me and we started talking.
Neither of us was from a privileged background and we had come from an era where women’s tennis wasn’t on an equal footing with men’s tennis so we’d had to battle to get to where we did. In that conversation we went from being rivals to allies again.
Playing together at the London 2012 Olympics was such a celebration of everything we’d experienced. I remember us jumping up and down in the locker room after she heard that she was in the team. We both desperately wanted to be part of the Olympic dream before our careers ended. Playing doubles together for Team GB, we reverted to being kids again and kept shouting ‘tube it!’ to each other (ie hit it hard), and then laughing at ourselves.
After we’d lost our doubles we sat on the court for ages after everyone else had left, just chatting about our careers and how happy we were to be there together in that moment. We were at peace with ourselves, our careers and each other.
It breaks my heart that Bally won’t experience the life she had planned. That’s why it’s so important to those of us who loved her to continue the work she started with her foundation. That indomitable Bally spirit lives on.
