Rajon Rondo's No-Look, Over-The-Head Assist Is Simply Bananas
Rajon Rondo is blowing our minds this week with a no-look assist that basically defies all logic.
During a Wednesday night game against the Orlando Magic, Rondo threw a jaw-dropping over-the-head pass to his Dallas Mavericks teammate Monta Ellis, who went on to score a basket.
“[This] assist will tie your brain in knots,” For The Win declared.
The Mavericks bested the Magic 107 to 102. The Mavs are 44-25 this season.
