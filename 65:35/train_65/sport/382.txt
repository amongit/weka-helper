Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic's pooches hoping to bask in their master's glory

Will it be Rusty and Maggie May posing alongside their master’s Australian Open trophy – just as they did after Andy Murray won gold and silver medals at the London 2012 Olympics – or will it be Novak Djokovic’s dogs Pierre and Tesla showing off the spoils of victory?
When Murray takes on Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open on Sunday it will not just be the world tennis’s numbers six and number one struggling for domination of the sport, it will also be the battle of their dogs for their master’s glory.
Indeed when photographers are present it is not just Novak’s wife Jelena and Andy’s fiancée Kim Sears seen posing on their players’s arms. Their dogs are just as likely to take centre stage.
Both couples also regularly tweet pictures of their pooches in a variety of tennis – or otherwise – related poses.
When Murray won the Wimbledon Championships in 2013 Maggie May and Rusty posed alongside the trophy, though the two border terriers seemed fairly indifferent to the cup which it had taken a British player 77 years to win.

And when her owner was awarded the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year in the same year, there was Maggie May again, with the trophy. It came as little surprise then to see her sharing the glory when Murray was presented with the OBE, also in 2013.

Naturally the dogs cannot be given a seat in the player’s boxes during matches, leaving the business of whooping, fist pumping and, well, robust language, to Jelena and Kim, but they certainly like to get in on the act away from courtside.

Last year the Djokovics tweeted a selfie of themselves with Pierre and Tesla taking a walk through Wimbledon during the championships and they were again photographed in the couple’s arms after the traditional winners’ ball, following Novak’s five set victory over Roger Federer in the Men’s Singles Final.

Things have not always gone so smoothly for Pierre. In 2011 Djokovic was refused permission to bring the poodle into the country when he appeared at Wimbledon, because of rules governing Pet Passports, and was said at the time to be “genuinely upset” at the dog’s absence. Pierre was able to make it to the US Open that year, alongside Jelena, much to Novak’s delight. The threesome were duly photographed together at Flushing Meadows.
Not that Jelena and Kim are occupied solely with looking after the dogs while Novak and Andy do their stuff on the practice courts.
While Novak has been busy bestriding the world tennis rankings Jelena runs a foundation she set up to work with some of the most deprived children in the couple’s native Serbia. Projects undertaken by the foundation include restoring a children’s theatre in Belgrade, supplying new furniture for a primary school and repairing schools damaged in recent floods.

Kim has not gone as far as to set up her own charity, but she is understood to be hoping to do more in this sphere over the coming years.
Last year she ran the London Marathon, raising more than £14,700 for Malaria No More, a charity which works to combat the disease, particularly among children in Africa. She also took part in the Wimbledon- Roland Garros cycle challenge in aid of the Tennis First Charitable Trust, riding 400 miles in four days with her friend Sharon Ely. The pair raised more than £5,000 towards helping some of the UK’s most talented young tennis players reach their goal of playing on the professional tour. Kim’s father Nigel Sears, a leading coach on the WTA tour for several years, is one of the charity’s ambassadors.
Last year Murray was given the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award for his work in support of the battle against cancer and malaria. He is a founding member of the Malaria No More’s UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with David Beckham.
He has also taken part in several cancer fundraising matches, including last year’s Queen’s Club event in memory of Elena Baltacha, which raised money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis.
