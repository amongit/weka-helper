Luis Suarez lauded his El Clasico winner as his biggest goal since moving to Barcelona, as the Catalan giants moved four points clear of Real Madrid with a 2-1 win on Sunday.

Coach Carlo Ancelotti was consoled by his side's much improved display in the first hour of the game compared to their wretched form in recent weeks.
However, he admitted his side wilted under the pressure of chasing an equaliser for the second time after the break.
"I think it was a mental problem not a physical one. We started looking for more difficult passes and that is why the last half-hour didn't go like the first-half.

"We are disappointed, but it is better to have better feeling in the way we played. We can have more confidence in the future games in the league and the Champions League."
