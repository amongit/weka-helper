From the roars to the gasps, from the sounds of joy at thumping Toulouse to the sighs of relief at holding off a spirited Glasgow, Bath have travelled along the spectrum of emotions over the past seven days. The upshot is that they joined Wasps as the first sides to qualify for the knockout stages after losing their opening two games in the pool. Historical ramparts are never easily breached and, boy, did Bath have to scrap their way into the quarter-finals for the first time since 2009.
They were forced to live off their nerves as an under-strength Glasgow pounded forward just before the final whistle in search of an improbable win. It was tense, taut, compelling and, in truth, not wholly deserved for Bath on the run of play. This was an about-turn in style from the pyrotechnics at the Stade Ernest Wallon, Bath being awarded two penalty tries for huge forward-led shunts while Glasgow, shorn of at least half-a-dozen front-line players relied on sleight of hand and invention.
From glamour to grunt, from sparkle to sweat, Bath have had to dig into their repertoire, including coping with the early loss to injury of Kyle Eastmond. Whatever it takes.
Bath will care little for the merit or otherwise of the win. This jangling final day, with scores filtering through all afternoon from the other pool game Montpellier, was all about the outcome. Bath had to show character and self-belief to get the job done.
This was one of those days when they had to show guts in the face of a remarkable effort from Glasgow, to be stern and resilient when things were not going their way and to throw themselves into the tackle as the likes of Sean Maitland and Finn Russell came within inches of touching down in those frantic closing moments.

Bath can only prosper from the experience. They have yearned to be back among the big boys of Europe and now they are. Their slipshod start to their pool, and their dramatic mid‑campaign rally, can only inure them to what lies ahead. They have topped the pool, but still must travel to Leinster for the quarter-final.
After victories on the road in this pool in Montpellier and Toulouse, leaving the splendour of the Recreation Ground will not faze them. Far from it. These are the games in which they want to be involved.
“We don’t fear going away,” said Mike Ford, the Bath head coach, who reported that Eastmond had a recurrence of the shoulder ‘stinger’ that forced him off last week and would be scanned by England today. “We have to take confidence from qualifying. To consider where we were in October, to get to this stage is a great achievement.
“Last week you had the dash in our game, this week the grunt. Glasgow threw a few shots and we were not at our best. I’m delighted we found a way to win. The margins are so small but we were on the right end of it all.”
That was due almost entirely to their pack. Glasgow, through the ceaseless ­activity of men such as Fraser Brown and Leone Nakarawa at the breakdown, made life a misery for Bath backs. They simply could not shake off the defence, shackled at source. Sean Maitland was a handful from the rear, Alex Dunbar likewise in the centre, setting the tone for a lively afternoon with a terrifically constructed try in the fifth minute. It set Bath on their heels and ensured that this was going to be no gimme no matter Glasgow’s injury problems coming into the match.
Bath realised that they had to apply pressure in the only area in which they had some dominance, the scrum. They had to wait until after the interval for that superiority really to tell – what an impact their backup front-row of hooker Ross Batty and the props Nick Auterac and Henry Thomas made – and relied on the boot of George Ford for their six first-half points, from two penalties.
Glasgow hit Bath as strongly and pointedly after the break as they had in the first half, scoring one of the tries of the weekend through No 8 Richie Vernon, after the ball had passed through numerous pairs of hands, with Russell, Mark Bennett and the ever-tricky wing, Tommy S­eymour, all involved.
But then the pendulum began to lurch the other way, wrenched in Bath’s favour by their heavyweight operators up front. A penalty shot at goal was turned down for a crack from a line-out. The forwards kept their side of the bargain, sending Glasgow back-pedalling from 20 metres and the referee James Lacey went under the posts to signal a ­penalty try as the galloping maul was pulled down illegally.
Midway through the second half, Lacey was signalling the same distressing thing for Glasgow fans after a five-metre scrum, awarded after the Bath full‑back Anthony Watson was somehow held up as he went for the line, was heaved goalwards,
Glasgow did not raise the white flag, finishing the stronger as first Seymour, then Bennett and Maitland all went close. It was breathless stuff, as the creation of a little bit of history ought to be.
