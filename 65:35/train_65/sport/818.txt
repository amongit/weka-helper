Italy 20 Wales 61, match report: George North brilliance in vain for Welsh

It was not enough, but Wales did all they could in a sensational second-half demolition of Italy. Even if there was considerable gnashing of teeth over Leonardo Sarto’s late try, there could be no regrets over a performance in which they eviscerated a hopelessly outmatched Italy by playing with a holy trinity of pace, power and ambition.

The real regret lies in their second-half performance against England, which ultimately cost them the Six Nations Championship as well as a grand slam. Even without a title, Wales finished the tournament as the team with momentum with four straight victories.
In its own way, this was every bit as impressive as their defensive stand against the Irish the week before. From trailing 13-11 a couple of minutes before half-time, Wales ran in 50 unanswered points including a George North hat-trick to boost their points difference to +60. Sarto’s converted score reduced the target, but it was surpassed by Ireland in Edinburgh regardless.
Leonardo Sarto scores a try for Italy at the death
Anyone who claims that Wales are one-dimensional adherents to “Warrenball” needs to be shown a video of the second-half when they cut Italy to ribbons with incisive running, devastating lines and the occasional blast of raw power. Liam Williams, who moved to full-back after Leigh Halfpenny was withdrawn with concussion, was a snarling ball of energy, Rhys Webb a constant spark at scrum-half and Alun-Wyn Jones was immense yet again.
Some of the scores were breathtaking both for the quality of the attack and the poverty of the defending. Scott Williams’s try, which began under the shadow of his own posts, merits consideration for a place in the pantheon of great Welsh length-of-the-field tries. The only asterisk would come in the quality of the opposition. Italy were wonderfully committed in the first-half and held the lead three times. They had the nudge on at the scrum and were causing all manner of problems at the breakdown.


Then they ran out of puff quicker than an asthmatic penguin. The manner in which North was allowed to score his hat-trick would shame the Dog and Duck third XV. Luke McLean, the Italian full-back, in particular needs to take a good long hard look in the mirror at how he waved the giant Northampton wing through.

There was little inkling of what was to come at half-time. Dan Biggar’s penalty gave Wales a 13-11 advantage but it was anything but comfortable. After Jamie Roberts gathered Halfpenny’s clever grubber to score, Italy hit back when Giovambattista Venditti hit a sumptuous line. As Warren Gatland conceded, Italy were making life difficult.
“Italy really slowed the game down and if you look at how slow they were walking to halfway,” Gatland said. “So it was hard for us to get that tempo in the first half. Once we got into the game and got in front we started to play and we were very good.”
The catalyst was Webb’s quick tap penalty which led to Liam Williams breezing through against a dozing defence on 47 minutes. No Welsh back three player had scored in the tournament before this game; by the hour mark they had four. Williams set up North’s first by running back Luciano Orquera’s gift of a chip.
Leigh Halfpenny had to come off with a head injury
The Italian edifice was already wobbling. Once Andrea Masi was sinbinned, it collapsed quicker than a sandcastle against the incoming tide. Jones pinched an Italian lineout to give North his second score while his third saw him breeze past three tacklers to take Wales past England’s points difference.
No sooner than Italy had their full complement back than Quintin Geldenhuys was yellow carded and Wales were again ruthless in taking advantage with the wonderful Webb darting down the blindside before Sam Warburton snagged a long range effort. It was enough to drive the Italian defence coach to therapy but the punishment was not over as Italy were turned over a couple of metres from the Welsh tryline. The breakout was led by a trio of replacements in Justin Tipuric, Gareth Davies and Scott Williams who finished superbly.
On the charge: Captain Sam Warburton busts a gut for Wales
There was, though, a sting in the tail as Sarto danced down the left wing to score. Ireland’s victory made it academic anyway but Wales will emerge from this Championship with the confidence to take on all comers. Their defensive excellence was established against Ireland. Now they have demonstrated the quality of their attack, even if it was assisted by Italian incompetence.
“There is always a licence, no matter what people try and say, for these players to play what is in front of them and if they feel they can go from their own goalline they have that licence to make those decisions,” Gatland said. “They played with a bit more freedom in the second-half and there was some outstanding play with some great offloads which we spoke about during the week. We created some more of those and scored some great tries.”
