Arsenal's absence - teams who reached Champions League quarter-finals since Gunners last got there

Arsenal have perfected qualifying for the Champions League. Winning it remains as elusive as ever.
Under manager Arsene Wenger, Arsenal have played in the group stages of Europe's top club competition for 17 straight seasons. They even reached the final once, losing to Barcelona in 2006.


But while the Arsenal leadership seems satisfied by such consistency and the financial security it offers, the lack of European silverware is a glaring omission from Wenger's record.
It was a familiar hard luck story for Arsenal on Tuesday, coming oh-so close with a strong second-leg performance against Monaco - but ultimately falling out of the competition in the last 16 for the FIFTH straight season.

The Gunners became the first European team to score at Monaco this season - twice, in fact - while preventing the hosts from hitting the target once. But it wasn't enough after a defensive implosion at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg last month led to a 3-1 loss.
Despite Arsenal's 2-0 win on Tuesday, Monaco eliminated the London club on away goals, just as Bayern Munich did in 2013 following another 2-0 win away from home for the Gunners.

There will be the familiar grumbling about the away-goals rule, which Wenger has lobbied Uefa to scrap, but the reality is that the team repeatedly falls short.
