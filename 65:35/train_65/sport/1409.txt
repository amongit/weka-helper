Davis Cup: Queen's Club could stage GB quarter-final with France
Great Britain defeated the United States 3-2 in Glasgow to reach the last eight of the Davis Cup
16 March 2015 Last updated at 00:38
Great Britain's Davis Cup team have decided to stage July's quarter-final with France on grass - with Queen's Club emerging as the most likely venue.
Discussions since the first-round win over the United States have concluded that a grass court offers Britain its best chance of reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 1981.
A preliminary conversation with Queen's Club prior to the victory over the US was not said to be encouraging, but the mood has changed since the west London club became the team's preferred venue.
British number one Andy Murray made clear his preference for grass in the immediate aftermath of his straight-sets victory over John Isner, which clinched the first-round tie in Glasgow.

Murray has won all four of his grass-court matches against French number one Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and pointed out that the surface should also assist the powerful serve of team-mate Dom Inglot.
The initial concern was that it would be difficult to find a suitable grass court, with Wimbledon ruled out because the quarter-final is due to take place the week after the Championships.
But conversations with Queen's Club officials over the past week are said to have been very positive and there is now cautious optimism they will agree to host the tie from 17-19 July.
The views of members and local residents will need to be taken into consideration, as a Davis Cup tie would cause disruption.
The stands that are built every year for the Aegon Championships are due to go up at the beginning of May, and so could be in place for an 11-week period.
The LTA does, however, have an excellent relationship with Queen's and LTA legal director Stephen Farrow also runs the Aegon Championships.
If costs do not prove prohibitive, Queen's is looking increasingly likely to stage the quarter-final.
