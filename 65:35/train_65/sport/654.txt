Rumaropen's team Persiwa Wamena were drawing 1-1 with rivals Pelita Bandung Raya when the referee awarded Pelita a penalty eight minutes before the end of the match.
Rumaropen was caught on camera punching the referee in the face.
The official's nose started bleeding so profusely that he had to be taken to hospital.
The match was delayed while a substitute referee was found, and Rumaropen was subsequently given a red card.
