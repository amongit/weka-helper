London 2012 remembered: Gemma Gibbons: I have moved away and put my degree on hold to focus on Rio 2016

A lot of people recognise me now which, as a judo player, never happened before the Olympics. In the first six months after the Games, people were constantly coming up to me to shake my hand or shouting out ‘it’s the judo girl!’
It has calmed down a bit now but you still get it once or twice a week. People seem genuinely interested in what I am doing.
The media interest in me has also grown massively. Before the Games I could count the number of interviews I had done in my entire judo career on one hand. Now that is obviously not the case.
I have experienced some amazing things in the past year that I would never have dreamed of. For example, I went to Rio de Janeiro with David Cameron and a couple of the boxers from the Games.
We went into the favelas to visit a place called ‘Luta pela Paz’, or Fight for Peace. It is a kind of academy that uses martial arts and boxing to get the kids off the streets but it also uses education as well.

I also went on a celebrity edition of Million Pound Drop in support of Cancer Research UK with Ashley McKenzie, one of my judo team-mates. We managed to win £25,000 by answering the question: ‘Brad Pitt was the first man to do what this week?’
The answer was that he had fronted a Chanel No 5 advert, which was pretty easy, though it is a bit harder when you are under pressure in the TV studio.
I am now an ambassador for Cancer Research UK, which is a great honour. Because of all the publicity about my mother dying of cancer, a lot of charities approached me after the Games to ask if I would help. If you could, you would help them all but there are not enough hours in the week for me to do that so I chose the charity that I felt most strongly about.
I have now left my old home in south-east London and am living in Edinburgh with my husband, Euan Barton, who is also a GB judo player. We got married a few months ago, though we had been going out for about four years before that.
Euan is from Scotland but, before London 2012, we lived apart to concentrate on our Olympic preparations. It made sense for me to move north rather vice versa because Edinburgh happens to have one of the best judo training bases in the UK.
I had also planned to begin a teaching degree in PE at Edinburgh University but I have now decided to defer my studies until after the Rio Olympics.
Unfortunately, I have had a few injury problems. I broke my thumb while competing at the Olympic Games, which took me out for four months afterwards.
I recovered in time for the British trials, which I won, and then I won the German Grand Prix, but a couple of weeks later I broke my wrist while lifting weights in the gym and had to miss the European Championships.
I have just returned to competition, so maybe my life will return to some sort of normality from now on.
