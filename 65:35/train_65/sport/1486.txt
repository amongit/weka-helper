McIlroy says split with agent is about trying to improve his game
Rory McIlroy reveals his decision to split with his long-term agent Andrew 'Chubby' Chandler 's International Sports Management agency is "about trying to play my best golf".
A fantastic year saw the Northern Irishman become the youngest-ever winner of the US Open in June, and McIlroy believes believes having "a new environment" may allow him to improve his game.
McIlroy, 22, most recently won golf's biggest prize with victory in the Shanghai Masters , and says Chandler was "absolutely fantastic" but feels like he needs something "a little different" as his career progresses.
