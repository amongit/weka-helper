1. Jon Jones loves these moments. The cartwheel. The prayer. The performance. Deserved 49-46 x 3. Agreed completely with the scoring. There was no need for the apology about “being classless” after the fight.
2. Don’t motivate Jon Jones in a ‘bad blood’ hate match – it just makes him better.
3. Jones could step up to heavyweight, and if he did so, he could do it in the knowledge that he has wiped out an entire division of challengers and former champions. But will he step up and fight at heavyweight in 2015, having called out the divisional champion Cain Velasquez?
4. Referee Herb Dean has a chin, taking a punch from Daniel Cormier at the end-of-round fight.
5. Donald Cerrone made a statement against a great up-and-coming fighter. Disciplined, controlled, supreme, thoroughly deserved 30-27 x 3. Cerrone is now a really experienced, savvy fighyter. Fifteen UFC fights in three years, it is time he was given a title shot at 155. Myles Jury will come again.

6. Kyoji Horiguchi continues to be impressive at flyweight. Easily the best Japanese fighter in the UFC in recent years. Open at times to being countered, but the commentary team focused on Louis Gaudinot more than Horiguchi, who probably doesn’t have it yet to defeat champion Demetrious Johnson, but he is not far away from a challenge. DJ might be better off facing him sooner rather than in 12 months time.
7. Paul Felder looks to be an exciting addition to the lightweight roster. He defeated Danny Castillo, great finish, and will be a fan favourite with that style.
8. Yves Lavigne is a great referee. His timing was perfect in stopping the Castillo-Felder fight.
9. Conor McGregor could make 2015 another great year for himself, Ireland and Europe. Cracking interview with Joe Rogan during the broadcast of UFC 182. McGregor: “I will stiffen Dennis Siver up and make way for the biggest fight in UFC history. I’m not looking past him (Siver), I’m looking through him.”
10. Did McGregor almost let slip in the interview that the UFC are planning a title fight in August in Ireland with Jose Aldo, if the Irishman defeats Siver in Boston in two week’ time?
