Lewis Hamilton wins Australian Grand Prix easily but sparks furious outburst from Mercedes' rivals

The chequered flag had barely fallen in Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix before Mercedes were involved in a bitter row with their rivals who were demanding an urgent shake-up of the rules to prevent a two-horse race this Formula One season.
The scale of victory enjoyed by Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg left Ferrari and Red Bull in particular reeling, immediately pressuring the sport’s rule makers to peg back Mercedes’ advantage for the sake of the show. However, their pleas drew a withering response from Mercedes chief Toto Wolff, who urged them to “get your f------ head down, work hard and try to sort it out” before suggesting those “moaning” should make their complaints at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.

Rosberg, who finished second behind his team-mate, even suggested he hopes the competition will gain ground to help the sport, prompting ridicule from third-place man Sebastian Vettel.
But Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, was most vocal in his warning, after a chastening weekend for the team with engine supplier Renault hopelessly behind the rest.
“I fear the interest will wane,” Horner said. “I didn’t see much of Mercedes on the television and I can only imagine that it isn’t interesting watching a procession so the producer was looking for other battles going on in the race – except there weren’t that many cars to look at. The highlight for me was Arnie [Schwarzenegger] on the podium.

“Take nothing from Mercedes, they have done a super job. They have a good car, a fantastic engine and two very good drivers. The problem is that the gap is so big that you end up with three-tier racing and that is not healthy for Formula One. Unless there is an intervention, we are set for a season with quite a broad running order.”
But Wolff was having none of it.
“If you come into Formula One, try to beat each other and perform at the highest level and then you need equalisation after the first race - you cry out after the first race - that’s not how we’ve done things in the past,” he said. “I think ‘Just get your f****** head down, work hard and try to sort it out’.”
Quickly clarifying his remark, Wolff added: “I didn’t mean the f-word in relation to him (Horner).”
Asked whether he feared another political season, Wolff replied: “It is always a political season. It was last year and it is this year.
“There is this wall in Jerusalem that you can stand in front of and complain. Maybe the guys should go there.”
The scale of Mercedes’ dominance in the season-opening race was astonishing, the gap possibly even bigger than last year, both in qualifying and the race. Even Hamilton seemed taken aback.
Of course, Horner’s is not an impartial view. His priority is finding a means of returning Red Bull to competitiveness as soon as possible, and at present changing the rules is his best hope.
The 41-year-old, who was again deeply critical of Renault, claimed it was not simply sour grapes and that when his team were dominating Formula One, ingenious designs were consistently banned to try to peg them back.
Horner added: “On today’s evidence we are set for a two-horse race at every grand prix.
“When we were winning – and we were never winning with an advantage that Mercedes has – double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was banned, engine mapping was changed mid-season – anything was done to pull us back. That was not just us, it was done to McLaren and Williams in other years.

“Is it healthy to have a situation like this? The FIA within the rules have an equalisation mechanism and that needs to be looked at.”
But it is nothing like as simple as banning an innovation Mercedes have come up with. Horner suggested that the FIA, motorsport’s governing body, use complex sensors on the cars to effectively limit the amount of power a team can use. It is tantamount to asking Steve Redgrave to row with one arm behind his back.
Yet even Rosberg seemed aware that Mercedes walking away with the title for the second year in succession was not good for Formula One.
“I do think about the show,” he said. “Half of me – or a part of me – thinks about the show because I want to give people a great time at home watching on TV or at the track. If you [Ferrari] do come a bit closer, that would be awesome for everybody.”
Vettel responded by joking that he would therefore like Mercedes to open up their garage at the next race in Malaysia to allow the competition in for a snooping exercise.
The four-time champion mocked: “Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it’s going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you’re saying?”
The German was in buoyant mood after finishing on the podium in his first race with Ferrari, even if it was some way behind the Mercedes.
Sauber also had reason to be cheerful with their points haul after a legal quagmire had threatened to prevent them racing at all.
“It was a great reward for the team that had to deal with unfavourable circumstances,” Monisha Kaltenborn, their team principal, said.
