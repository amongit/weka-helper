Man City and Shakhtar Donetsk won their titles last year, but does money buy success?

Manchester City’s success since Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan started pouring billions of pounds into the club may suggest that money brings success in football, however this is not strictly the case.
Last season out of the 15 richest owners in world football, only two of them saw their sides lift their respective league titles.
Mansour saw City win the Premier League for the second time in three seasons while Rinat Akhmetov’s Shakhtar Donetsk won the Ukrainian Premier League for the fifth time in a row.
But this can be misleading. Eight of the richest owners' clubs last season played in the Premier League.
Out of these eight English clubs, six of them are owned by foreign owners, but globally most of the 15 richest owners in world football own clubs from their own country.

The majority of the 15 richest owners come from Europe, and they all own teams in Europe, but only six of them own a team which last season played in Europe’s top club cup competition, the Champions League.
Fulham’s Shahid Khan and Anzhi Makhachkala’s Suleiman Kerimov’s were nowhere near Europe’s elite last year, and they saw their teams relegated from their respective leagues despite their billions.
