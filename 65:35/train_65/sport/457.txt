A dramatic video has emerged of a high speed rally crash at a championship in Poland earlier this month.
Driver Wojciech Szulc was lucky to escape without any serious injuries when his Mitsubishi Lancer crashed and flipped onto its back during the Magura Malastowska rally.
Safety crews were on hand to free the driver from the wreckage and take him to a nearby hospital.
Miraculously, Szulc only sustained minor bruising from the crash.
