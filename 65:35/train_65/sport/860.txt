Goodbye Thanks for joining tonight, just four more sleeps until the return of the Premier League.
21.41 Well, that was pretty dismal stuff for the most part, and the goal to win it, although welcome, wasn't exactly a classic either. Kroos can hit them a lot better than that, and Kiko Casilla in the Spanish goal will be desperately disappointed not to have kept it out. He'd looked similarly uncertain with a Volland effort minutes before so credit Kroos for having a go I suppose. Hard to draw particularly concrete conclusions on either side given how many players both teams were missing, but Spain will have hoped for a bit more dynamism from their young players. Nolito aside, and to a lesser extent Isco, it was a very laboured, flat performance from a team that seams to be in transition, with most of its best players on the wane. Germany were fine, but looked content to just soak up pressure and wait for a breakthrough, which eventually came.

Full-time: SPAIN 0-1 GERMANY (Kroos 89') The Bayern Munich midfielder's late effort separates the sides after a disappointing match in rainy Vigo.
90+1 min Khedira is taken off for Lars Bender for the final couple of minutes.
GOAL! SPAIN 0-1 GERMANY (Kroos 89'). The midfielder receives the ball on the edge of the box, and with not a lot on has a go. His shot is not particularly powerful but Kiko Casilla, who's looked uncertain since coming on for Casillas, can't keep it out and it squirms in for what will surely be the winner.
86 min Germany look content to suck the life out of the remaining few minutes as they stroke the ball around without really going anywhere.
83 min Spain have the ball in the back of the net but it's wrongly ruled out after Azpilicueta was incorrectly deemed to have been offside in the buildup. Germany respond by taking off Gotze, who is replaced by Kruse.
82 min Isco makes a great break right through the heart of the German midfield and he lays off a pass to Pedro, but his curling effort is well saved by Zieler.
81 min Hard not to long for the likes of Xabi Alonso, Cesc Fabregas, David Silva, Iniesta etc while watching this. Isco and Nolito have impressed in fits and starts, but Spain have been so flat tonight.
79 min Volland has a pretty speculative effort from about 30 yards for Germany, but Kiko takes no chances and parries it away rather than holding onto it.
78 min The game's best player Nolito is replaced by Barcelona's Pedro, and Spain also change their keeper. Casillas goes off to be replaced by Kiko Casilla. And they say friendlies are meaningless matches demeaned by constant substitutions.
76 min This is one of those games that makes it difficult to remember how goals are ever scored. I can't really fathom the concept of a goal right now - both teams are making it look impossible.
74 min Callejon makes an immediate impression, as he scampers down the right and whips in a low cross that Mustafa almost turns into his own net, but manages to hook clear. The rain is absolutely pouring down in Vigo.

72 min Volland is freed down the right by an excellent Kroos crossfield pass, but the winger's cross is parried clear by Casillas on the stretch.
70 min Change for Spain - Garcia goes off for Napoli's Callejon.
69 min Bellarabi has been bright for Germany since coming on for Muller, and he gets forward to get effect down the right, before Khedira's attempted scooped through ball to Gotze is headed clear by Bartra.
66 min Morata and Nolito are trying to get Spain going, but Germany are repelling Spain's attacks pretty comfortably, and Zieler remains relatively untested in the visitors' goal.
63 min Garcia is the first booking of the night, after one of the most comical fouls you're likely to see. Bellarabi bursts forward on the counter, and Garcia just grabs onto him for about 10 yards until eventually the German can run no more and falls to the ground.
61 min Bartra does his best to make something happen as he bursts into the box from the centre-back position, but his touch is ultimately heavy and he's forced into a foul on Howedes. I won't lie to you, this hasn't been a classic.
59 min Spain win a Free-kick in a dangerous position after Rudiger brings down Nolito on the edge of the box. The Celta Vigo dusts himself down and takes the free-kick, but it's a relatively comfortable save for Zieler away to his right.
57 min Morata nearly gets away for Spain but after the striker turns away from Mustafa, Howedes slides in to make a recovery tackle and the ball trickles through to Zieler.
55 min A Germany free-kick pinballs around the Spain box and it falls to Rudiger about 12 yards out, but his volleyed effort is deflected wide. The visitors definitely the better side at the moment.
52 min Germany playing with a bit more authority this half, and it's they who are probing and looking for spaces around the edge of the Spurs box. No chances as yet but Khedira's influence is growing and he's seeing plenty of the ball in more advanced positions.

49 min Garcia does well to get into space down the right, but his cross is easily collected by Zieler.
46 min We're back underway in Vigo for the second half of Spain v Germany. A couple of changes at half-time... Marc Bartra, Raul Albiol and Ignacio Camacho on for Busquets Pique and Puyol.
Half-time Spain have had more of the ball, but Germany came closest to scoring through Gotze's effort that forced Casillas into a good save. Azpilicueta was also inches away from an own goal. Spain's best effort came from the lively Nolito, whose shot from the edge of the box was saved by Zieler. Lots of pretty patterns, but not a great deal of cutting edge as yet.

44 min Nervous moment for Azpilicueta as he flicks a Durm cross just over his own bar, with Rudy waiting for a tap-in. That was very close to being an own goal.
43 min Spain win a free-kick on the right and Isco's delivery is decent, but Isco's header is over from about eight yards.
39 min You have to admire how well both sides zip the ball about in tight spaces, but at the moment attacks are tending to break down when either side gets to the edge of the box. Certainly that's what's happening in Spain's case.
36 min Spain overelaborate in their own half, and Rudy is quick to capitalise, forcing the ball forward to Volland, whose attempted through ball is blocked by Pique. That was a crucial interception or Bellarabi was through on goal.
33 min Germany so nearly take the lead after great work down the left from Gotze forces Casillas to block only as far as Rudy, who shanks his volley high and wide from about 12 yards. Spain with the possession, but the visitors with the better chances so far.
31 min The hosts again try to attack down the right - this time through the busy Raul Garcia, but Germany are equal to the threat and Mustafi gets the block in. Nolito then has half a chance but Zieler is quick to close him down and the winger can't get enough on his close range effort.
28 min Spain probing, and Azpilicueta gets a cross in from the right, but Howedes does well to ease Morata out of it. Mustafa is back on, and looks ok.
26 min Half a chance for Isco as the Real forward receives the ball on the edge of the box from the rampaging Bernat, but he puts his effort high and wide. Such is Isco's talent, you'd have expected him to work the keeper there. Germany meanwhile have another man down, with defender Mustafi limping off the pitch for treatment.
23 min Muller tried his best to carry on and he doesn't look in too much pain, but his night is over with that injury. He's been replaced by Leverkusen winger Karim Bellarabi.
21 min That's the move of the match by a distance - Gotze and Muller exchange passes on the edge of the box and the former bursts into the box to get in a low volley, but Casillas makes the save down to his right. Lovely stuff from the Bayern pair, and a good save from the Real keeper.
18 min Raul Garcia has a pop from the edge of the box with his left foot, but it's a comfortable save for Zieler. 16 min Can't argue with John's prediction about the passing so far - both sides are stroking it around very comfortably without possessing much of a cutting edge. Muller meanwhile has taken a knock, but is back on and looks ok to continue.
John McEnerney writes...Evening Charlie, can see both sides in the last 4 of Euro 2016 but the Germans are a better unit than this Spanish side & are very comfortable with each other as we saw in Brazil. Spain have lots of new faces who are good players but not the same quality as the guys they are replacing, they'll be in better shape for the next World Cup. May or may not be a cracking game but lots of passing on the deck from both sides.
13 min Superb stuff from Nolito, who revieves a pass from Bernat, moves inside Rudiger with a lovely Cruyff turn and gets a shot off that's saved by Zieler. Really inventive stuff from the Spanish debutant, who's playing at his home ground this evening.
11 min Spain enjoying all the territory and possession at the moment, but they're not creating any chances. Germany look pretty comfortable soaking up pressure, and they'll hope to spring Spain on the counter with Muller and Gotze.
8 min Bernat and Nolito are linking up well down Spain's left, and the full-back gets in a low dangerous cross right into the famed corridor of uncertainty, but no-one's there for Spain to tap home.
5 min Half a chance for Germany as Muller's loopy cross goes all the way to the back post where Volland stoops to get in a header, but it's straight at Casillas.
3 min Germany the brighter of the two teams early on, and Durm gets to the byline down the left but his cross is cleared by Ramos. Spain very comfortable in possession when they get the ball as you would expect.
19.45 Germany's national anthem is a little dirgey, Spain's has a bit more about it and is sung with a touch more gusto. Anyway, we're underway in Vigo after captains Casillas and Khedira exchange pennants...
19.40 The teams are out and kick-off is just five minutes away...
19.31 It looks like Germany will be lining up in a 3-4-3 formation, while Spain are playing a 4-2-3-1 with Juventus youngster Alvaro Morata leading the line.
19.22 Six years ago, Fernando Torres broke German hearts with this goal in the Euro 2008 final...
19.13 Four Real Madrid players start tonight - Casillas and Isco for Spain, and Khedira and Kroos for Germany. Isco scored an absolute peach against Belarus on the weekend, and he's currently preferred by Real fans to a certain Gareth Bale, so it'll be interesting to see how he gets on tonight. It's also a chance for him to stake a claim for a regular starting spot in the Spain team with the likes of Cesc Fabregas currently unavailable. For Khedira, a good performance here, and you can expect a hasty revisiting of rumours that he will imminently be joining Arsenal/Chelsea/Bayern Munich/Manchester United (delete as appropriate). 19.00 Below is what happened the last time these two met...Carlos Puyol headed home the only goal of the 2010 World Cup semi-final in South Africa.
Lukas Podolski has unsurprisingly taken to Twitter to give his thoughts on tonight's match... <noframe>Twitter: Lukas-Podolski.com - Matchday, Former World Champions vs New World Champions.

18.52 Firstly, doesn't Isco look like Jamie Redknapp in the picture. Secondly, the last two occasions these sides met have been pretty crunch games - the 2010 World Cup semi-final and the Euro 2008 final. On both occasions Spain won 1-0. Prior to that, the two sides' last meeting was in 2003, with Spain winning 3-1 courtesy of a brace from Raul and one from Guti.
18.42 And here is the Germany team...Zieler; Howedes, Mustafi, Rudiger; Rudy, Kroos, Khedira, Durm; Muller, Volland, Gotze. Joachim Low has made four changes to the side that beat Gibraltar on Sunday, with goalkepeer Ron-Robert Zieler, Benedikt Howedes, Antonio Rudiger and Kevin Volland coming into the side. Ron-Robert really is a superb name, and this will be a fourth cap for the Hannover keeper. Howedes you remember looking very uncomfortable at full-back during the World Cup. Rudiger is a promising young centre-back for Stuttgart, while Volland is a striker for Hoffenheim, with just the one goal to his name this season. Elesewhere it's pedigree ahoy with Kroos, Khedira, Muller and Gotze all in the side.
18.32 Spain's team for tonight is already out...Casillas; Azpilicueta, Pique, Ramos, Bernat; Raul Garcia, Busquets, Bruno, Isco; Morata, Nolito. A few less familiar names in that team, such as 28-year-old winger Nolito, who plays at this ground for Celta Vigo and will pick up his first Spanish cap this evening. Juan Bernat, the Bayern Munich left-back, starts and will pick up only his second cap, while Villareal defensive midfielder Bruno gets only his sixth cap this evening. In total Vicente Del Bosque makes six changes from the team that beat Belarus on Saturday.
18.30 Hello, Charlie Eccleshare here - welcome to this evening's friendly match between Spain and Germany at the Balaidos in Vigo. This clash sees the last two winners of the World Cup going head-to-head, with Spain eager to show that they have bounced back from the disappointment of relinquishing the trophy in Brazil this summer. Despite their lofty reputations, both teams have endured a less than perfect start to their Euro 2016 qualification campaigns - Spain lost 2-1 to Slovakia last month, and Germany suffered a 2-0 defeat to Portugal and a 1-1 draw at home with Ireland. They did each record wins at the weekend however, with La Roja defeating Belarus 3-0 at home (including a gorgeous Isco goal) and Germany beating minnows Gibraltar 4-0, also at home. Manager Joachim Low was pretty angry about the performance however, and said: "I am everything but satisfied with this. The team did not do what we wanted to do. We wanted to play as world champions and four goals are too few." Will he be more satisfied with his team's performance tonight? We shall soon find out...
Preview Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has demanded his players put on a show as his rejuvenated side prepare to welcome Germany, the team that succeeded them as world champions.
"When you get this kind of match there's almost no difference whether the game is an official one or like in this case a friendly," said Del Bosque, whose side go into the game on a high having rediscovered their form.
"We want to play well, to put on a show," he said.
"They (Germany) want to remain at the highest level, and we want to keep up our post World Cup momentum," said Del Bosque, after Saturday's 3-0 European qualifier win against Belarus.
Germany coach Joachim Low looked to be taking the game less seriously than Del Bosque.
"We're delighted to be taking on a team of such a high technical level. It's the perfect test for us," Low said in Vigo, where the teams are due to play.
"But if we lose I won't consider it a defeat that would compromise our chances for next year (of winning Euro 2016). It's not so important," said Low.
Low has recently complained that Germany is suffering a post World Cup hangover, and that a fresh start is needed in the New Year.
"After this match, we need a good break and a long holiday so everyone can recharge our batteries," he said.
