England polo squad set sights on gold at FIP World Championships in Chile

England will attempt to land their first medal since 2004 when the 10th FIP World Polo Championships take place at the end of the month in Santiago, Chile.
England have never won the event, which was first staged in 1987, but the Hurlingham Polo Association has assembled a four-strong squad laced with experience and youth for the 14 goal handicap showpiece.
The squad flew out this week for a tournament in Argentina before travelling to Santiago. The four-man team will comprise Will Emerson and Peter Webb - aged 32 and 40 with five handicaps respectively - George Pearson and Jack Hyde, who are 18 and 17. Both teenagers have a two handicap, while Jack Mesquita is the travelling substitute.
Emerson and Webb have played together for the last five years and have competed well in 15-goal and 12-goal events in the UK.
“It is great to have a few wise heads on young shoulders,” said Webb, the oldest member of the team. “Having four younger guys is fine but sometimes it’s a case of having older players, as they tend to peak that bit later.”

Each team will be allotted a pool of horses by a random draw, while each player will be allowed six horses per match.
Webb admits it’s how England can adapt to the “good and bad” horses which will play a key role in how they perform in Chile.
“If we have some luck with the horses and some good ones come our way then we have a great chance of winning with a very good team,” Webb said.
England will be coached in Chile by Anthony Fanshawe, who was appointed as polo manager at Guards in November.
“We will be spending a lot of time together so it’s important that the team gels,” added Webb. “Anthony has so much knowledge from his time playing high goal so he will bring that extra goal.”
Santiago last held the FIP World Championships in 1992 when England took bronze place behind Argentina and Chile.
