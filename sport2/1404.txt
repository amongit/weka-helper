Four-time champion Roger Federer beat American Jack Sock in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.
Sock, 22, was outclassed by second seed Federer 6-3 6-2.
The 33-year-old Swiss will next face Czech Tomas Berdych , 29, in the last eight, who earlier beat fellow countryman Lukas Rosol 6-2 4-6 6-4.
Three-time champion Rafael Nadal will meet Milos Raonic with Novak Djokovic set to face Bernard Tomic.
On facing the big-serving Canadian sixth seed, Nadal said: "He's an amazing player, one of the young stars. It will be a big test for me."
Nadal, 28, reached the last eight by beating Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2 6-4, his only blip coming when he dropped his serve when serving for the match at 5-2 in the second set.
"Simon is always a tough opponent but I think I played a positive match," the Spaniard said. "I played a solid match and did not make many mistakes."
Raonic, 24, had earlier reached the quarter-finals by beating Spain's Tommy Robredo 6-3 6-2, while Australia's Tomicbooked his place in the last eight with a 6-4 4-6 6-4 over compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis, sealing victory on his fifth match point.
Tomic will take on defending champion Djokovic after the Serbian world number one beat John Isner 6-4 7-6.
Meanwhile, Britain's Andy Murray will face Spaniard Feliciano Lopez after beating unseeded Frenchman Adrian Mannarino and in doing so equalling Tim Henman's Open-era record for career wins by a British man.
Lopez earlier beat fifth-seed Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-4 7-6 (7-2).
