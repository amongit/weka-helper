Are These World Cup Players Seeking Divine Intervention? (PHOTOS)
The 2014 World Cup has already been full of heartbreaks and victories. And per Pope Francis' example, we aren't taking any sides.
Some athletes, however, are praying that God is on their side; perhaps with a little divine intervention, especially when something like a surprise goal that tips the game's tie to a 2-1 win at the last minute occurs. (We see you, John Brooks.)
Over and over again the World Cup victors can be spotted looking, pointing and gesturing up toward the heavens in a moment lament or thanks. Here are some of our favorites so far:
