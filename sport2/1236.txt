West Ham United have been hit with another huge injury setback after central defender James Tomkins suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder in training.
Tomkins will have scans on the injury today, but the 25-year-old could struggle to play again this season.
West Ham manager Sam Allardyce must now travel to Arsenal on Saturday with only one fit centre-back in James Collins.
Winston Reid is already out with a hamstring injury, which means Allardyce will have to move midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté back to play as a makeshift partner for Collins.

Allardyce is also without first-choice right-back Carl Jenkinson, because loan cannot play against his parent club.
Alex Song could step back into midfield to replace Kouyaté against his former club having been for West Ham’s defeat by Chelsea.
The injury to Tomkins happened just hours after Allardyce had revealed that forward Enner Valencia is poised to miss the Arsenal game having suffering a toe injury in a freak accident.
Valencia required emergency hospital treatment, with the club confirming he had suffered a “deep laceration” stepping on a piece of broken porcelain after he dropped a teacup to the floor.

Allardyce, who is also without injured strikers Andy Carroll and Carlton Cole, said: “Enner has had an accident at home and has cut his big toe quite severely on a broken cup.
“We think it will be too soon for him be considered for the game at Arsenal. It was a freak accident at a time when we could have done without it.” Allardyce had hoped that his squad would return to action recharged and fit after taking them on a warm weather training break to Dubai.
“Everyone enjoyed the break,” Allardyce said. “The lads enjoyed the quality of the training sessions. A bit of rest, both mentally and physically, will help us to win more games in the last 10 games of the season.
“I’ve done it every season for 13 or 14 seasons. The research by the LMA shows the benefits of having a break and the evidence shows the risk of injuries decreases.”
