Six Nations: Game plans for Wales, Ireland and England

Wales
They know that they need to score at least 30 points, so they need to play at tempo and get their runners attacking a broken field.
Italy do not reorganise in defence particularly well and France caught them out like that last weekend.

Wales can take advantage of this as well, maybe better. They need to get Jamie Roberts over the gain line early and then the forwards can play off that, with scrum-half Rhys Webb keeping Italy under pressure with his own threat, as well as bringing those forwards off him.
Penalties may result initially so Wales can build a lead through Leigh Halfpenny and then score the tries required later.

Ireland
I think they should use their driving maul as their main weapon. Italy showed how effective this can be against Scotland, and Ireland have a very powerful maul.

They will want to tie in the Scottish forwards and then release Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton around the fringes. If they get the maul right, Scotland will simply have to commit forwards in an attempt to stop it, so then Ireland can run hard at the inside backs.
They may even try to set up mauls in the middle of the field. Look at how effective that was for England last weekend from the very kick-off against Scotland.

England
Their forwards have to win the game for them. If one of the front five wins the man-of-the-match award then the job will have been done.

They need to get that front five into the game just as they did in the first match of the campaign against Wales. So scrum-half Ben Youngs will be very important, as he was in Cardiff when he brought his forwards into the game superbly with their repeated tight-channel carries.
If the France pack is put on the back foot, as it was in Paris against Wales, then everything else unravels.
