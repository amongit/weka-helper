Tottenham fear Hugo Lloris could miss Burnley clash

Tottenham Hotspur fear goalkeeper Hugo Lloris could be ruled out of their Premier League trip to Burnley with knee injury he suffered against Leicester City.
Lloris was forced off in just the fourth minute of Tottenham’s victory over Leicester after suffering a deep gash to his right knee in a clash with team-mate Kyle Walker.
Having been to hospital, Lloris immediately withdrew from international duty with France and will miss the games against Brazil and Denmark.
Spurs are also worried the wound may not heal sufficiently in time for Lloris to return to action after the international break against Burnley on April 5.
Losing Lloris for any length of time would be a big blow to Spurs, as the 28-year-old has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe. Deputy Michel Vorm conceded three goals against Leicester, but was not to blame for any of them.

Meanwhile, the Football Association will examine the post-match comments of Leicester manager Nigel Pearson on Monday.
Pearson was furious with referee Mike Dean’s decision to award Tottenham a penalty with the game level at 2-2 and claimed: “He is one of the most arrogant men I have ever met.”
The fact Pearson’s attack did not accuse Dean of showing bias or question his integrity may limit the FA’s right to punish him.
