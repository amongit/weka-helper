Switzerland v England: Wayne Rooney could play on left wing as Roy Hodgson expects 'baptism of fire'

Roy Hodgson is again considering using Wayne Rooney on the left wing as he anticipates a “baptism of fire” for his young England players in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign that starts with Monday’s testing away fixture against Switzerland.
England have trained in a number of formations in recent days – including, a 4-2-3-1 line-up with Rooney on the left, Raheem Sterling in the middle and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right behind Danny Welbeck.
Alternatively England have looked at a diamond midfield behind Rooney and Welbeck as a strike partnership – with Sterling at its tip. Either way it appears the 19-year-old Liverpool player is emerging as England’s key man.
Hodgson has said that Rooney will be England’s “centre-forward” in Basle – a likelihood strengthened by the thigh injury that has ruled out Daniel Sturridge – but he has practised with alternative approaches while training at St George’s Park.
Hodgson could adopt 4-2-3-1 with Rooney as the striker and Welbeck, who has pleaded to play as centre-forward, on the left.

Sturridge’s injury, the extent of which is still being assessed back at his concerned club Liverpool, has reduced Hodgson’s options as he admitted that his young squad is under increasing scrutiny in this qualification campaign after a disappointing World Cup.
“They’re getting a baptism of fire, many of them are coming in very young and into an air of negativity,” Hodgson said of his squad, which includes young players such as Calum Chambers and John Stones following several international retirements.
“Maybe I’m asking for too much of an ideal world here – and from you all [the media] – but let me make the point that in an ideal world it would be nice to look at the squad as it is now, look at the individual players and the types of talents they are, at how quickly they’ve come from being total unknowns to being accepted as respected England players. They would agree with me that they need a bit of time, these players.
“They’re not going to suddenly step in and be Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard or John Terry or Ashley Cole. They might need a bit of time before they reach that level.”
Rooney, who has admitted the World Cup was the “worst experience” of his career, has been given the captaincy despite questions over his form and role in the team. Hodgson conceded that his future may eventually lie in a deeper midfield role.
“I’m not prepared to dispute that, in time, he could move back,” Hodgson said. “But he will be playing centre-forward on Monday and we’ll see after that. When it comes to those six [forward players] and how do we play – in a diamond, one in front of the four, two up front, I’m lucky the players I’ve got can do all those things.”
That first statement would appear to be unequivocal about where Rooney will feature in Basle but Hodgson has looked at other options in training, even though playing him on the left failed in Brazil.
