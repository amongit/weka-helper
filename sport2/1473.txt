Wigan winger Josh Charnley will be out for six weeks with an ankle injury.
The England man suffered the problem in Wigan's 13-12 Super League win over Hull FC on Friday, when he sustained a high ankle strain.
The 23-year-old has been a regular in the Warriors side this season, starting every game so far.
"It's unfortunate but it gives Dom Manfredi a chance to show what he can do and I'm chilled about it," said head coach Shaun Wane.
"Dom can do things which Josh can't. I'm a big fan of his."
