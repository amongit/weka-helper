There's No Obstacle That Can Stop Me
When I was in a foster home for eight years, I had a rough life. My foster mom would always put me down because of my disability and didn't think I could do things for myself.
I basically had to learn on my own to prove to my maternal mom and to myself that there's no obstacle that can stop me from doing what I love to do.
People said I couldn't pitch for my softball team. They didn't think I could pitch very well because I only have the use of my right hand. I throw the pitch than have to quickly put the glove on the same hand so I can catch the ball.
It hurts me a lot inside when people tell me I can't do this or that because of your disability. I don't listen to that. I do what I think I can do to the best of my ability.
It took a lot of hard times and practice to get used to pitching than putting the glove on one hand. When someone says I can't pitch, or I can't run, I go ahead and motivate myself to do that to show them that I can do everything that they said I can't do.
It feels wonderful to pitch on a winning softball team. It feels even better to do the things that people told me I never could.
