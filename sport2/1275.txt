Eufemiano Fuentes offered blood transfusions for £3,400, Jorge Jaksche tells court in Spanish drug trial

In four hours of hugely damning testimony, Jörg Jaksche detailed how Fuentes would charge €4,000 (£3,400) to transfuse one bag of blood, but offered a discount for two. Fuentes, former team manager Manolo Saiz and three others are on trial in Madrid for endangering public health and face two years in jail if convicted.
Jaksche, who has admitted doping from 1997, said that Fuentes provided him with EPO, the insulin derivative IGF-1 and female hormones that stimulated testosterone production.
The German rider explained that Fuentes’ office provided a map of France on which were marked the locations for transfusions and drug injections. “From the amount of circles on the map I could almost not see France,” he said.
Jaksche, code-named Bella in Fuentes’ files, also implicated the Polish doctor who is alleged to have provided banned drugs that went to the Spanish top-flight football team Real Sociedad.
He identified Markus Choina as an associate of Fuentes and said that Choina gave him a blood transfusion during the 2005 Tour de France when he was racing for Liberty Seguros-Würth. He also detailed how Choina reinfused his blood in a hotel when that Tour passed through Germany.

By naming Choina, a Germany-based anaesthetist originally from Poland who was linked to Polish track and field and their national football team in the 1980s, Jaksche has reignited claims that Real Sociedad were heavily involved in a doping programme. Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, who was at Real Sociedad from 1999 to 2004, said he had no knowledge of anyone using such substances.
El Pais has published Fuentes’ documents, which were dated 2003 and were uncovered in the Spanish Civil Guard raids of 2006. One document, which was entitled “Accounts Asti” and included the inscription “RSOC”, listed Choina as the supplier of two drugs: Actovegin, which countered the sluggish side-effects of EPO, and Synacthen, a powerful stimulant.
El Pais said it had also seen Fuentes documents that detailed how payments for medicines costing tens of thousands of euros in January, February and April 2002, and of €12,000 (£10,300) directly to Fuentes.
The former Real Sociedad president Iñaki Badiola repeated his claims that, in the seven years before his 2008 appointment, the club paid nearly €330,000 (£282,000) “in black money to buy medicines and to pay Fuentes”. He believed the RSOC code referred to his former club. The club denied the claims.
The second cyclist to give evidence, the 2005 Tour runner-up Ivan Basso, said he had agreed to deal in which he would pay Fuentes €70,000 (£59,800) but had given him only €15,000 (£12,800) because the police raids interrupted his plan. Basso, whose code name was Birillo, the name of his dog, said he gave blood that was frozen to be reused to help him win the 2006 Tour. He said he never had the blood transfused.
Meanwhile, the UCI has claimed that one of its main critics, the former UCI employee Michael Ashenden, had said that Lance Armstrong’s blood profile was normal based on analyses carried out between October 2008 and March 2009.
The ruling body added that the Australian was the only one of three scientists who studied the samples to make such a declaration.
