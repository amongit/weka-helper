Firsts: In 2005-06, McDonald was skipper of Ericsson 1 while his wife Lisa was skipper of Amer Sports Too. It was the first time the race had featured husband and wife as skippers. And probably the last.
Best moment: Winning three legs and coming second overall after taking over as skipper of Assa Abloy in 2001-02. We weren’t supposed to do well but we did and that was hugely satisfying.
Worse moment: Performance wise, when we lost the second rudder on Telefonica last month and realised we couldn’t win the race. Everyone went quiet. It was a terrible moment.
Scariest moment: The hull damage in this race in the Southern Ocean was pretty scary. We were 2,000 miles from land so didn’t have too many options. There is no one to rescue you down there and if we’d carried on, we would have sunk.
Best crew: Probably Telefonica – 40 laps of the world between them as well as a few gold medals but I’ve been lucky with all the crews I’ve sailed with.

Best skipper: I enjoyed sailing with Lawrie Smith and also Grant Dalton. Two very different people but they were both great skippers. The most talented is Iker Martinez. He’s totally dedicated. Amazing sailor.
Best race: 1997-98 with Silk Cut was the most relaxed, but the best was 2001-2 as part of the Assa Abloy crew.
Worst race: 2005-2006 with Ericsson 1. That was very hard work. We started late and there were a lot of anxieties because it was the first generation of these new boats and we never felt like we were in with a shout.
Greatest contribution: I don’t think I have made much of a contribution, though I hope I have helped people enjoy the race more.
Greatest regret: Not making people outside the sport understand the sport. I could have done much more on that front.
In a nutshell: I’ve had a great time. I met my wife through sailing and have done some of the best sailing anyone could have done offshore, I have made some great friends and have made a decent living. I have been incredibly lucky.
