Serena Williams is rejoining the tennis family - and stepping away from her father's influence

Tennis – the loneliest of sports – has always rewarded outsiders. Just look at our two greatest male champions: Fred Perry, the son of a Labour MP who was never welcomed at Wimbledon, and Andy Murray, who spent his teenage years raiding across the border in his mother’s minibus.
It is a sport of firebrands, obsessives and malcontents. Most of the true artists have complex and flawed personalities, which do not sit easily with the endless round of airports, massage tables and press conferences. Some (John McEnroe) rage against the system. Others (Andre Agassi) try to subvert it by wearing denim shorts and snorting crystal meth.
Over time, though, even the most determined members of the awkward squad tend to soften, and to assimilate themselves slowly into the so-called “tennis family”. Which brings us to Serena Williams’s decision to return to Indian Wells – the Californian showpiece where she was due to play Monica Niculescu overnight – for the first time since 2001.
Trained on litter-strewn courts in Compton by self-taught parents, the Williamses are the ultimate outsiders. And from the very beginning, their defiant attitude stood out provocatively from the genteel facade of women’s tennis. When Venus Williams conquered Wimbledon in 2000, her father Richard held up a sign that read “It’s Venus’s party and no one’s invited”.
This was the context for those highly charged scenes at Indian Wells the following year. It all started when Venus pulled out of her semi-final against Serena a matter of minutes before the scheduled start. She cited tendinitis in her knee but there were rumours about Richard arranging things from backstage.
The next day, Serena was booed repeatedly throughout a three-set victory over Kim Clijsters. So were Venus and Richard, as they walked down the stairs to their courtside seats, Richard characteristically responding with a clenched-fist black power salute.
“Nobody would have booed some blonde, blue-eyed girl,” wrote Serena in her 2009 autobiography. “And nobody would have shouted down her father with cries of, ‘Go back to Compton, n-----!’ You don’t just ignore this kind of prejudice and hope it goes away. No, I won’t go back.”
Well, it took another six years, and extensive negotiations with Indian Wells’s billionaire owner Larry Ellison, but in early February Serena made her announcement. In a first-person article in Time magazine, she quoted a verse about forgiveness from the Gospel of Mark, and also mentioned how much more support she now feels from tennis as a whole. A key moment here was the instant condemnation – and year-long suspension – handed out to Russian official Shamil Tarpischev when he crassly referred to “the Williams brothers” during a TV interview in October.
Intriguingly, Serena has been accompanied to the desert by her mother Oracene and elder sister Isha, but not by Richard or Venus. Which supports the argument – most persuasively made by Doug Robson in USA Today – that she is gradually disentangling herself from her father’s overbearing influence.
The biggest step in this process was the coaching alliance with Patrick Mouratoglou that began in the summer of 2012, and represented – in the words of Chris Evert – “the first time she went to a resource outside of the family that her dad didn’t have control over”.
You can also see it in her burgeoning friendships with peers such as Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka. And in her decision to move out of the Florida home she used to share with Venus, the sister who was always that little bit tighter with Richard than she was.
They may still play doubles together, but both literally and metaphorically, the two sisters are coming from different places these days. On the court, Venus scraps for every last point yet emotionally she still keeps her distance from the wider tennis world. Serena, by contrast, has been gradually reconciling herself with her sport, as the Indian Wells decision makes clear.
Increasingly, she stands in the centre of her own Venn diagram, poised midway between her natural family and the tennis one. The position seems to suit her. As she wrote in Time magazine: “I’m still as driven as ever, but the ride is a little easier.”
