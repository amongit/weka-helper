Southampton have secured the future of the latest young star off the club’s successful production line with Ryan Seager poised to sign a new four-year contract.
Forward Seager has been watched by all of the Premier League’s top clubs, having scored 16 goals for Southampton Under-21s this season.
The 19-year-old made his Premier League debut for Southampton last month as a late substitute against Swansea City, following his first senior game in the FA Cup in January.
Seager won the inaugural Under-21 Player of the Month award for February and has now been rewarded with a new deal.

Southampton have become famous for their long list of young talent over the past 10 years, with Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw all coming through the club’s ranks.
Seager is the next player ready to break through and the Saints were desperate to make sure he could not be lured away by one of the Premier League’s top four.
Despite growing up as a Southampton fan and looking up to Matt Le Tissier, Seager claims to have modelled his game on former Liverpool striker Michael Owen.
While the Saints have tied Seager down to a new deal, the club may have more difficulty in hanging on to midfield prospect Callum Slattery.
Slattery, who turned 16 last month, is being watched closely by Arsenal, who are keen to add him to the list of players they have taken from the south coast.
