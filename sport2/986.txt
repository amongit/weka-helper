British sailor Neal McDonald calls time on brilliant Volvo Ocean Race career. One question: will he come back?

His sixth Volvo Ocean Race, serving as watch leader with Telefonica looked set to earn him the victory that, bizarrely has escaped him since he first participated, as a bowman on Lawrie Smith’s ill-starred Fortuna campaign in 1993-94.
But it wasn’t to be. From leading the race for eight months of the race, Telefonica slumped to fourth place on the final leg, the campaign hampered by slow downwind speeds and a broken rudder in the penultimate leg.

“Some campaigns have been about doing the best we can rather than winning but with this campaign I really felt we had a good chance of winning so to come fourth is very sad,” he says.
“We have had some fantastic racing – some of the closest and most competitive racing I have ever done but we didn’t achieve our goals.”

McDonald, a qualified naval architect as well as being Britain’s most complete offshore sailor, learned his ocean racing from Smith who had been an Olympic team-mate at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, when McDonald was campaigning Flying Dutchmans (6th) class and Smith a Soling (4th).
Smith carried on his Olympic sailing winning bronze at Barcelona in 1992 and while McDonald briefly campaigned a 49er, becoming European champion, his Olympic career was sidelined in favour of big boats.
He returned to Smith’s stable in 1997-98 for the highly rated Silk Cut campaign but the race proved to be seminal in shaping a new era with trailblazing American Paul Cayard, skipper of winning boat EF Language, setting unparalleled standards of professionalism in terms of fitness, competitiveness, work rate and communications . Silk Cut were found wanting and came fifth.

In 2001, McDonald joined Assa Abloy and was promoted to skipper at the end of the first leg. Understated and painfully modest, he seemed embarrassed by the upgrade, prompting one journalist to liken him to Peter Pan losing his virginity but McDonald swept to victory in the fifth leg, and came second overall with a success that he rates as the highlight of his Whitbread/Volvo career.
Four years later, he started as skipper of Ericsson 1 which from the outset was beset by technical problems. After three poor legs, he was demoted to watch captain in an episode that stands out for him as a career low point.
He emerged with his dignity and respect in tact and in 2008-09, returned to the ranks as a watch leader with Green Dragon in 2008-09, coming fifth and continuing with the same role in this edition with Telefonica.

The race has changed dramatically over the 20 years he has been involved and it is the longer race, the shorter stopovers and his extra responsibilities as father to Lily and James that has prompted his decision, finally.
“The race has become more stressful because everything is sailed to within a knife edge of sensible seamanship but the level of professionalism has also increased which is why there are relatively few accidents or injuries despite the added danger.
"The days when the boat is slowed to change sails are long gone. Everything is done at full pelt in modern racing which makes it hard work. It is incredibly hard work.”
He has completed more than 200,000 nms on the Volvo race in five different roles with six different teams under seven different skippers so his list of firsts and lasts, best and worst, highest and lowest is one to be reckoned with.
What they say about McDonald. . .
He is certainly the most complete British sailor of our generation. Above all else, offshore Neal is a fantastic team player with little or no ego. It is an injustice that he has not won this race. British skipper Ian Walker
It is extremely rare to have someone who can combine sailing experience with a technical and engineering background. His contribution to the race has been massive. Juan Kouyoumdjian, yacht designer
He’s a genuinely nice bloke and all of us will miss not having him out on the water, although I don’t think this will be the last we see of Neal offshore. He’s still got plenty of life left him in yet! Grant Dalton, former skipper, two times Volvo winner
It’s quite simple. Neal is the best Volvo sailor there has ever been. A brilliant all-rounder but I’m with Dalts. He’ll be back. Andrew Cape, Telefonica navigator
