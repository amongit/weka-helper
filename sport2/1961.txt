EARLIER:
Few expected the Eastern Conference Finals to last this long. If the series even went six games, then many thought it would be Miami with a shot to close it out. But the Celtics outplayed the Heat for three consecutive games (arguably four) after falling into an 0-2 hole to take a 3-2 series lead.
Then LeBron James stepped up, dropping 45 points and 15 rebounds in an elimination game to force the series back to South Beach.





LeBRon, Wade and Bosh scored the Heat's final 31 points.
