Australian Open 2015: Serena Williams sets up final against Maria Sharapova

The sporting world’s most one-sided rivalry will be reunited in Saturday’s women’s singles final at the Australian Open, after both Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams eliminated their lesser-known opponents in straight sets on Thursday morning.
Despite their joint status as the headline acts of the women’s tour, Sharapova and Williams have never established a compelling narrative in their head-to-head meetings.
Put simply, the series has been a near-total wipeout for Sharapova, who famously beat Williams as a naive 17-year-old in the 2004 Wimbledon final, only to lose all but one of their 16 match-ups since.
Is it technical? Is it psychological? What we do know is that these two queens of the court show little warmth towards each other, and even less since the imbroglio at Wimbledon 18 months ago where they started taking pot shots at each other’s partners.
You may remember that Williams made reference to Sharapova’s boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov as “the guy with the black heart”, whereupon Sharapova painted her old foe as a marriage-wrecker on account of her close relationship with coach Patrick Mouratoglou.

So what will happen on Rod Laver Arena on Saturday? “It’s not impossible that Maria turns it around here,” said the 1980s legend Martina Navratilova. “After all, we saw Tomas Berdych beat Rafael Nadal this week after 17 losses. But Serena just really digs in. She would hate nothing more than to lose to Maria.
“It is just a bad match-up for Maria,” added Navratilova. “Once the rallies start she is okay, but getting into the points is hard for her. Where she gets in trouble is with her second serve, Serena attacks it really well. And then whereas Maria’s return of serve is great against most players, Serena can overpower that with her pace.
“Serena also defends better, she is quicker around the court, so Maria’s best chance is to focus on offence: go down the line a lot, change direction early and get Serena on the run. She should not have lost that many matches in a row; she is a better player than that.”
Sharapova certainly looked in fine fettle on Thursday morning as she swept past fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova with barely a hitch. The 6-3, 6-2 scoreline perhaps underestimates the dominance of the world No. 2, who struggled to hold her first service game, but then found her self-belief and her rhythm in an overpowering display.
There was more tension in Williams’s semi-final against a woman 14 years her junior, the brilliant 19-year-old Madison Keys. The first set of this one was extremely tight, as Keys belted down ace after ace to stay in contention until a tie-break.
Remarkably, it was the first tie-break that Williams had been forced to play at the Australian Open since 2010, but she held her nerve superbly, snatching the vital mini-break with a punishing backhand return of serve and then driving on to a 7-6, 6-2 victory like the juggernaut she is.
Keys, however, can take enormous credit. Not only for going so deep in this tournament but for fending off eight match points and delaying Williams’s victory for over a quarter of an hour before she finally succumbed.
