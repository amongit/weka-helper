US PGA: Coy Rory McIlroy quietly confident
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy believes he has a good chance at the US PGA Championship, despite initially looking bashful when reminded of his US Open victory at Congressional.
McIlroy adds that Tiger Woods, who recently returned after knee surgery, is still the "biggest attraction" in golf, and a successor has not yet emerged.
The US Open champion tees off at 1845 BST on Thursday, while former world number one Woods tees off from the 10th hole at the Atlanta Athletic Club at 1335 BST.
