Heat Fan Screams Behind Bill Simmons During ESPN Postgame Show, Gets Shoved (VIDEO)
ESPN's postgame coverage of Game 7 of the NBA Finals was nearly as unpredictable as the game itself. When not dealing with purported technical difficulties, ESPN's "NBA Countdown" crew had to fend off a boisterous fan.
As Bill Simmons was discussing the Heat's performance in Game 7, a Miami fan climbed onto the edge of ESPN's set and started screaming. Simmons briefly hesitated, but was able to keep his composure and continue the segment despite the high-volume interloper over his shoulder.
A staffer quickly walked over and shoved the Heat fan away from the set.
