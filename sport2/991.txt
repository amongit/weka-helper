Groupama's Franck Cammas (1st, below) Started out as foxy Franck with the beaming smile and finished as fearless Franck (with an even bigger smile) after a nigh on flawless performance on the quickest boat in the fleet. One of the best sailors in the world just got better. 10/10 Next stop? Sailing's Hall of Fame

Camper's Chris Nicholson If there were rosettes for flogging dead horses, Nicholson would have a wall covered in blue. No one quite knows how Camper pulled off second place, apart from pure grit and iron guts among a crew who deserve to be decorated. Very popular victory in last leg to Galway. 9/10 Next stop? The honours list (Arise Sir Chris!)

Puma's Ken Read Loved by race followers for his honest, articulate (and golf-laden) 'just a three iron away from Camper' updates. Read (pictured below, right) was blessed with a decent boat and a fantastic crew who sprang back valiantly from the gut wrenching dismasting in Leg 1 to stay in contention. Involved in two leg wins and some of most thrilling finishes in the race. 8/10 Next stop? The 19th hole
Edwards calls for all-British crew

Telefonica's Iker Martinez Looked invincible in the first three upwind legs but downwind, Telefonica looked ordinary and couldn't raise their game. Delamination on Leg 5 dented hopes and the dream died when the second rudder broke on Leg 8. Led the race for eight of the nine month race but finished fourth. Martinez devastated. 7/10 Next stop? The Olympics (he and Xabi Fernandez compete in 49ers in Weymouth)

Abu Dhabi Racing's Ian Walker The biggest disappointment since Lawrie Smith's Silk Cut campaign in 1997-98. Big budget and top crew saw Abu Dhabi start as favourites and finish as slow coach also rans. They won Leg 7 into Lisbon and three in port races but these were scant compensation. The second Volvo disappointment for Walker, who skippered Green Dragon to fifth place in 2008-09. 4/10 Next stop? A lie down in a darkened room

Sanya's Mike Sanderson (6th) Set out wanting to 'mix things up' since he knew full well he had the slowest boat in the fleet but struggled to make any impact, offshore or inshore on the race. "I promise to never go even Wednesday night racing in a boat which is slower than the rest of the fleet," he said at the end. 4/10 Next stop? The bank
