London 2012 Olympics: sport-by-sport guide to Team GB's strongest medal hopes

BEST BETS
Athletics
Britain met its seven-medal target at the World Championships in Daegu last summer, spearheaded by Mo Farah’s 5,000 metres gold and 10,000m silver, and Dai Greene’s 400m hurdles triumph, but there were worrying signs about the country’s lack of strength in depth.
Beyond Britain’s seven medals, the country managed just six more top-eight finishes. The stars will have to perform at their best if Britain are to achieve their eight-medal target in London and two of those face new and imposing threats. Daegu sounded a warning bell for heptathlete Jessica Ennis in the shape of the Russian Tatyana Chernova, who took the Sheffield athlete’s world crown, while Phillips Idowu was upstaged by American newcomer Christian Taylor in the triple jump.
Key dates March 9-11: World Indoor Ch’ships (Istanbul); April 22 Virgin London Marathon; May 4-7 British Universities Ch’ships (Stratford, Olympic test event); June 22-24 UK Ch’ships & Olympic trials (Birmingham); June 27-July 1 European Ch’ships (Helsinki). Olympic prediction 8 medals.

Cycling
The form of Mark Cavendish, Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome on the road bodes well for early Olympic success while on the track Sir Chris Hoy, who won a world championship silver in the keirin and bronze in the sprint, appears to be getting stronger and faster.
The form of the other male sprinters, however, has been patchy. Lucy Garner was an outstanding world junior champion in the road race but neither Lizzie Armitstead nor Nicole Cooke made the podium in the senior women’s race.
On the track, the stand-out squad last year was the women’s pursuit team who won the world title in Holland and have dominated the World Cup series. Vicky Pendleton won a silver and bronze at the worlds, while Shanaze Reade is on target for gold in the BMX after winning the world title and Olympic test event.
Key dates Feb 17-19: London World Cup (Olympic test event, Feb 17-19); April 4-8: World Track Cycling Ch’ships (Melbourne). June 30-July 22: Tour de France. Olympic prediction 9 medals.
Rowing
Britain’s rowers are on course to dominate at Eton Dorney this summer after topping the medals table at the World Championships in Slovenia in September. In Olympic class events, Britain won three golds, three silvers and four bronzes, and added four more golds in non-Olympic and Paralympic events.
Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter, the Olympic champions in the lightweight men’s double scull, retained their world crown while the men’s four of Alex Gregory, Ric Egington, Tom James and Matt Langridge also claimed gold.
Completing the winning triumvirate was the women’s pair of Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins, who have yet to be beaten since they linked up at the start of the 2010 season. After three Olympic silvers, Grainger’s long quest for Olympic gold must surely reach fruition at London 2012.
Key dates March 8-11: Senior Trials (Eton Dorney). May 4-6: World Cup 1 (Belgrade). May 25-27: World Cup 2 (Lucerne). June 15-17: World Cup 3 (Munich). Olympic prediction 10 medals.
Sailing
The Finn class is dominated by Britain, although only Ben Ainslie will compete in Weymouth as Games qualification is limited to one entry per class. Ainslie and the other British Finn sailors won almost a third of the 44 medals won by the British squad in 2011, which was substantially up on 2010 (33) and proof that the country is on course for a successful Games.
The 470 men’s team of Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell and the women’s match racing team of Lucy and Kate Macgregor and Annie Lush showed their potential by picking up world silver medals. The 470 women’s pair of Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark also won world silver and earned Olympic selection, despite only teaming up in February. All but three of the 10 selections were announced in September, with only the 49er, the men’s 470 and the Laser Radial still to be decided.
Key dates March 31-April 2: Trofeo SAR Princess Sofia MAPFRE Majorca (Palma). April 20-27 French Olympic Week (Hyeres). May 23-27 Delta Lloyd Olympic Classes Regatta (Medemblik, Holland). June 4-9 Skandia Sail for Gold Regatta (Weymouth). Olympic prediction 7 medals.
Swimming
Golds in the 800 metres freestyle for Rebecca Adlington and in the 10km open-water race for Keri-Anne Payne were the highlights for Britain at the World Championships in Shanghai last July, though the overall tally of five medals in Olympic events was at the lower end of British Swimming’s target range.
Liam Tancock did add an extra gold in the non-Olympic 50m backstroke, and there were silvers for Adlington in the 400m freestyle, Ellen Gandy in the 200m butterfly and Hannah Miley in the 400m individual medley, but their success was tempered by the failure of some of their team-mates to live up to their potential. The consolation is that there were three fourth-places finishes, which British Swimming will hope to convert into podium finishes this summer.
Key dates March 3-10: British Ch’ships & Olympic Trials (Olympic Park, test event); May 21-27: European Ch’ships (Antwerp); June 20-23: ASA Ch’ships (Sheffield, final Olympic qualifier). Olympic prediction 6 medals.
STRONG CHANCES
On form: Sarah Stevenson was crowned taekwondo world champion last year
Boxing
British boxers have already qualified for the Olympics in five men’s categories, with further opportunities at the final European qualifier in Istanbul in April. The women’s places will be decided at the World Championships in Qinhuangdao, China, in May, and Britain have high hopes of qualifying in all three female categories. The British squad achieved their best medal tallies at the men’s European and World Championships last year, which included a gold for Nicola Adams at the Europeans.
The men won three world silvers through flyweight Andrew Selby, bantamweight Luke Campbell and super-heavyweight Anthony Joshua plus a bronze for light-welterweight Tom Stalker to add to the two golds, one silver and one bronze at the European Championships in Ankara.
Key dates April 13-22 European Olympic qualifier (Istanbul); May 21-June 10 Women’s World Ch’ships, Qinhuangdao, China. Olympic prediction 5 medals.
Canoeing
The sprint team exceeded their qualification targets at the World Championships in Hungary in August, winning two silver medals in Olympic events and a further medal in a non-Olympic event. Jon Schofield and Liam Heath won the silver in the K2 200 metres (after winning gold at the Europeans) and Ed McKeever narrowly failed to retain his world title, winning silver in the K1 200m.
The women’s K4 500m was fourth, just 0.072sec off third place. More importantly, the team qualified seven athlete places outrigh. Selections will be based on performances early this year and all eyes will be on Beijing Olympic gold medallist Tim Brabants, who is focusing on the K1 1000m. The slalom team have secured five places
Key dates April 23-15: GB Olympic slalom selection event (Broxbourne). May 11-13: Slalom European Ch’ships (Augsburg, Germany). May 16-17: Sprint European Olympic Qualifier (Poznan, Poland). June 22-24: Sprint European Ch’ships (Zagreb). Olympic prediction 3 medals.
Equestrianism
Britain boasts the world’s No 1 and No 2-ranked eventers in Mary King and William Fox-Pitt, as well as the European title-winning dressage team of Laura Bechtolsheimer, Charlotte Dujardin, Emile Faurie and Carl Hester.
Hester won silver in both the grand prix special and grand prix freestyle sections last year, with Bechtolsheimer collecting a bronze in the grand prix special. Britons also picked up bronze medals in the team show jumping and team eventing at the Europeans as well as an individual bronze for show jumper Nick Skelton.
Key dates April 25-29: Dressage, Hagen (Germany). April 25-29: Eventing, Kentucky. May 3-7: Eventing, Badminton. June 20-24: Show jumping, Rotterdam. July 3-8: Show jumping & Dressage, Aachen (Germany). Olympic prediction 3 medals.
Taekwondo
Just four gold medals are available, and Britain could well be challenging for all of them. Last year’s World Championships in South Korea underlined the country’s strength as Sarah Stevenson claimed her second world title while Welsh teenager Jade Jones took silver and Martin Stamper won bronze. Aaron Cook was eliminated in the first round but is now world No 1.
Key dates: March 3-4: German Open. May 3-6: European Ch’ships (Manchester). Olympic prediction 3 medals.
OUTSIDE HOPES
Unstoppable: triathlete Alistair Brownlee strolls home to victory at Hyde Park
Archery
Britain only partially met its 2011 targets but has qualified in five Olympic archery events by right, with a sixth place in the women’s team event highly achievable. Indeed, Britain’s best medal hopes may well lie in the team competitions. At the Olympic test event at Lord’s, the British women conquered world champions Italy before narrowly losing to Japan in the bronze-medal play-off.
Key dates Feb 5-9: World Indoor Ch’ships (Las Vegas). March 31-April 1: GB Olympic Selection Shoot 1 (Lilleshall). April 14-15: GB Olympic Selection Shoot 2 (Lilleshall). April 20-21: GB Olympic Selection Shoot 3 (Lilleshall). May 21-26: European Ch’ships & Olympic Qualifier (Amsterdam). Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Badminton
Imogen Bankier and Chris Adcock were the revelation of last year’s World Championships, winning a silver. They are currently ranked 16th in the world, two places above fellow Britons Robert Blair and Gabrielle White and seven places above Nathan Robertson, the 2004 Olympic silver medallist, and Jenny Wallwork.
Key dates Jan 10-15: Malaysian Open (Kuala Lumpur). 3-5 Feb: English National Ch’ships (Bolton). March 6-11: All England Open (Birmingham). April 17-21: European Ch’ships (Karlskrona, Sweden). May 20-27: Thomas & Uber Cup Finals (Wuhan, China). Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Diving
Britain returned from the 2011 World Championships with Tom Daley no longer world champion after he could only muster fifth place, well short of the outstanding Qiu Bo, of China. Daley entered the tournament just seven weeks after losing his father to cancer but even he admitted that his performances were lacking the consistency that earned him a global title in 2009. He faces a significant struggle to overcome Bo, who won the individual 10m platform event with a massive score of 584.45 points, but he remains a strong contender for silver.
Daley and his synchro partner, Pete Waterfield, remain outside medal prospects while their female equivalents could also challenge. Tonia Crouch and Sarah Barrow finished just outside the medal places at the worlds but face a battle for selection from Megan Sylvester and Monique Gladding.
Key dates Feb 20-26: World Cup (Olympic test event, London). March 16-17: World Series (Dubai). March 23-24: World Series (Beijing). April 13-14: World Series (Moscow). April 20-21, World Series (Tijuana, Mexico). May 14-20, European Ch’ships (Eindhoven). June 8-10: British Ch’ships & Olympic trials (Sheffield). Olympic prediction 2 medals.
Football
Stuart Pearce’s selections for the men’s squad are set to dominate the headlines in the build-up to London 2012. How many non-English players will defy their home associations and line up for Team GB, and will David Beckham be deemed good enough to take one of the three permitted over-age places in the under-23 squad? The women’s team will receive far less coverage but may be the ones to deliver a medal.
Key dates June 8-July 1: Euro 2012 (Poland & Ukraine). Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Gymnastics
While the women’s artistic squad have qualified the full quota of five, the men missed the opportunity to do likewise at the World Championships in Tokyo and face a crucial test at London’s 02 Arena next week when they have a second chance to qualify. Beijing bronze medallist Louis Smith was Britain’s sole medal-winner at the worlds, taking bronze on the pommel horse. World Series champion Dan Purvis and former world champion Beth Tweddle cannot be discounted. Kat Driscoll could be a decent outside bet in the trampoline event.
Key date Jan 10-18: Olympic Test Event & Qualifier (02 Arena, London). Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Hockey
With Olympic qualification guaranteed, both the men’s and women’s teams have had the luxury of testing their younger players on the international scene and experimenting with tactics. Both teams have retained their world No 4 ranking. Last May England’s women finished their Champions Trophy campaign in fifth place, while the men came sixth in New Zealand in November — a disappointing performance which included a worrying 8-1 drubbing at the hands of Spain in what was the last high-profile international event before London 2012.
Key dates Jan 28-Feb 5: Women’s Championships Trophy (Rosario, Argentina). May 2-6: Olympic Test event (London). June 5-10: London Cup. Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Modern Pentathlon
Two young British athletes have already achieved the Olympic qualifying standard for London 2012 – Jamie Cooke, 20, who was fourth at the European Championships, and Freyja Prentice, 21, who finished eighth in the same competition. Cooke also took the junior world title in November.
Neither is certain to compete at 2012 as there are two further qualifying opportunities for other British athletes, with a maximum of two men’s and two women’s places available per nation.
Mhairi Spence, ranked fourth in the world, won a silver and a bronze medal during the 2011 World Cup series, while Prentice won her first World Cup medal, a bronze. Both are pushing the Beijing Olympic silver medallist, Heather Fell.
Key dates May 7-13: World Ch’ships (Rome). May 26-27: World Cup Final (Chengdu, China. July 4-10: European Ch’ships (Sofia). Olympic prediction 2 medals.
Shooting
The British squad surpassed expectations by winning four medals at major championships in 2011 and they have also qualified four Olympic quota places. Peter Wilson is Britain’s outstanding medal hope, having climbed to No 1 in the double-trap world rankings last August after a superb season which included his first gold medal on the World Cup circuit. He was also a member of the British double-trap team that won gold at last year’s European Championships.
Key dates April 18-28: World Cup & Olympic test event (Woolwich). June 17-26: European Ch’ships (Larnaca) Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Tennis
Andy Murray, who again missed out on a grand slam title in 2011 when he lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final, is Britain’s only realistic medal contender. Elena Baltacha remains Britain’s top female player with a world ranking of 51. Only the top 56 qualify for the Olympics as of right.
Key dates Jan 16-29: Australian Open. May 27-June 10: French Open. June 25-July 8: The Championships (Wimbledon). Olympic prediction 1 medal.
Triathlon
If the success of 2011 is repeated, British Triathlon will exceed its stated Olympic ambition of securing one Olympic medal. Alistair Brownlee and brother Jonny dominated the World Championship series, finishing first and second overall.
Welshwoman Helen Jenkins also underlined her Olympic credentials when she regained her World Championship crown with series of consistent results, starting with her emphatic victory at the Olympic test event in Hyde Park. But one small cautionary note: none of the previous World Championship winners has gone on to win the Olympic gold.
Key dates World Championship Series, April 14-15: Sydney. May 12-13: San Diego. May 26-27: Madrid, Spain. June 23-24: Kitzbühel. July 21-22: Hamburg. Olympic prediction 2 medals.
