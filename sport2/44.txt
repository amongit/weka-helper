Rockies release right-hander Jhoulys Chacin
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- In a surprise move, Colorado released right-hander Jhoulys Chacin after the former Rockies' ace struggled this spring.
After going 1-7 with a 5.40 ERA last year, Chacin had a 6.52 ERA in four appearances in Cactus League games, two starts. He walked four and struck out five in 9 2-3 innings.
''It's a tough day,'' manager Walt Weiss said. ''A tough day for us, for me having to have that conversation with Jhoulys, who has been a warrior for us.''
The reason for the move, Weiss said, was that the club had brought in a number of starting candidates and, ''We just felt like Jhoulys was behind a few of the other guys.''
Chacin was 38-48 in six seasons with Colorado with a 3.78 ERA, including 14-10 with a 3.47 ERA in 2013.
