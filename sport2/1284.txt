How Manchester City are trying to be the next Barcelona

Recruitment 5/10
Txiki Begiristain’s appointment as Manchester City director of football in October 2012 came in the wake of a fractious summer of transfer dealings, with Roberto Mancini angered by the failure to sign Robin van Persie from Arsenal.
Mancini’s annoyance – the Italian was also unimpressed by the slow pace of City’s transfer moves – was directed largely at Brian Marwood, Begiristain’s predecessor, who was moved to an academy position following the Spaniard’s arrival. Widely respected for his work at Barcelona, in tandem with City chief executive Ferran Soriano, Begiristain (left) was handed control of recruitment – and had a hand in replacing Mancini with Manuel Pellegrini at the end of the 2012-13 season. However, while Mancini, with the help of former chief executive Garry Cook, lured the likes of Yaya Touré, David Silva and Samir Nasri to the club, Begiristain’s signings have been less impressive. Aside from Fernandinho, a £30 million buy from Shakhtar Donetsk, City’s recruitment under Begiristain has been unspectacular.
Eliaquim Mangala, at £42 million, has proven over-priced, while City waited half a season to replace Alvaro Negredo with Wilfried Bony last month. At Barcelona, Begiristain’s record was mixed: for every Dani Alves or Eric Abidal, there was a Keirrison or Henrique Adriano. Time will tell as to whether his signings at City will prove successful.

Youth development 5/10
During Begiristain’s reign as sporting director at Barcelona, the club’s La Masia academy nurtured a raft of talent arguably unsurpassed over the past 30 years. Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, Cesc Fàbregas, Sergio Busquets, Victor Valdes, Bojan Krkic and Gerard Piqué all progressed to the first team, providing a group of players, costing nothing, who would help Barça dominate for a decade.
Begiristain has been charged with ensuring that City eventually generate their own conveyor belt of talent, but 2½ years on from arriving, there are few signs of first-team players emerging from the elite development squad, overseen by Patrick Vieira.
As Sir Alex Ferguson discovered at Manchester United, rebuilding an unproductive youth system is a lengthy process, but City’s thriving youth set-up ground to a halt following Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan’s takeover in 2008.
Only one academy graduate, defender Dedryck Boyata (right), has since broken into the first team and made more than one Premier League start.
This season, José Ángel Pozo, 18, a £2.4 million buy from Real Madrid’s academy, has made one league start and two substitute appearances, but his progress has been checked by the January purchase of Bony.
City have invested millions in their new training ground, with the academy a key aspect, but now is the time for results.

Style of play 6/10
Barcelona’s success under Pep Guardiola was built around a 4-3-3 system, with fluid movement between the front six and defenders capable of starting attacks from the back. A central plank of Begiristain’s football philosophy is the need for a ball-playing centre-half alongside a more combative and destructive defender – Gerard Piqué’s partnership with Carles Puyol being the prime example of this at Barcelona.
In his early months at City, reports emerged of Begiristain imposing a 4-3-3 blueprint on the club, from youth team through to the first team. Although Pellegrini was appointed to enable City to pursue a 'holistic’ approach, with the likes of the manager, Begiristain, academy head Brian Marwood and EDS coach Patrick Vieira all regarded as spokes of the same wheel, Pellegrini has remained independent of tactical blueprints.

He has used 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 to great effect. At their best, there are similarities between City’s style of play and that of Guardiola’s Barcelona. The composure and vision of David Silva can replicate that of Iniesta, Vincent Kompany is a leader in the mould of Puyol, with Fernandinho capable of performing the Busquets role in midfield. City do not have a Messi but, on form, Sergio Agüero’s goals can come against the very best.

Success on the pitch 8/10
When Ferran Soriano declared in May 2013 that the challenge for Manuel Pellegrini was to win five trophies in five years, it signalled a new era of ambition at the Etihad Stadium and one in keeping with a club whose ambition is to establish themselves among the European elite alongside the likes of Barcelona. The FA Cup win of 2011, followed by the Premier League title 12 months later, ended almost four decades without major silverware for City.

Pellegrini’s appointment turned the focus to the future rather than the past. When Soriano and Begiristain joined forces at Barcelona in 2003, the club had not won a major trophy since the turn of the millennium and the pressure was on to revive a failing institution.
Led by the presidency of Joan Laporta, Soriano and Begiristain played significant roles in transforming Barcelona into the superpower they became.
At City, Pellegrini’s two trophies during his first season in charge put him ahead of schedule in terms of meeting Soriano’s target. But the Chilean will be judged on European success and how close he comes to taking City into the same stratosphere as Barça.
City reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time last season and Pellegrini has been charged with making further progress this year. But even City’s Abu Dhabi hierarchy concede that the team are not ready to win the tournament this season.

Growth of the brand 6/10
Soriano inherited a debt‑ridden club with salaries accounting for 88 per cent of Barcelona’s income, which was only the 10th biggest in world football, when he took charge of transforming finances and commercial earnings at the Nou Camp in 2003. Soriano has since admitted to “directly copying everything Manchester United did well” to take Barça into the top three of football’s global brands.

At City, Soriano is treading a similar path. The club now chase and acquire almost as many partnership deals as United and Barcelona, but the numbers are still tiny in comparison. City’s kit deal with Nike, worth £12 million a year, is likely to be renegotiated to £20 million a year, but United will soon earn £75 million a year with Adidas, with Barcelona’s Nike deal worth £28 million a year.
Outside Manchester and the United Arab Emirates – the home of owner Sheikh Mansour – City have yet to match their on-field success with similar growth commercially or in their fan base. Nonetheless, commercial revenues grew by 28 per cent in the most recent accounts thanks to increasing television earnings and Soriano is on course to steer City away from the choppy waters of FFP non-compliance this year.
City are growing, but while Soriano inherited a sleeping giant at Barcelona, he is having to build City from a much smaller base in a landscape dominated by the likes of Barça, Real Madrid, United, Liverpool and Bayern Munich.
