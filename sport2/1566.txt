UK Snooker Championship: Beating O'Sullivan a 'shock' for Trump
Judd Trump expresses his surprise at beating Ronnie O'Sullivan in the second round of the UK Snooker Championship in York.
The match finished 6-5 as some excellent attacking snooker culminated in a thrilling final frame in which both players made mistakes.
The Englishman says he'd rather stay away from reigning champion John Higgins in the next round.
