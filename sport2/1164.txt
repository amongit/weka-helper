Mark Carney watches over the world's sixth-biggest economy as governor of the Bank of England and heads a global banking watchdog, but somehow still finds time to train for a marathon.
Mr Carney, 49, will participate in the London Marathon in April to raise money for Cancer Research UK, a BoE spokesman said.
Although the Bank declined to comment on his training or preparation for this year's event, the Governor is known to run early in the morning before meetings. In London, he sometimes runs to or from the Bank rather than use his official car.
The Canadian, who took over the central bank in 2013, ran the Ottawa marathon in 2011, clocking up a time of three hours and 48 minutes that placed him 1,022nd out of 2,733 runners. That compares with a winning time that year of two hours and 10 minutes, set by Laban Moiben of Kenya.
Mr Carney has a long association with sport, playing in goal for his ice hockey team at Harvard. He is also a fan of the Edmonton Oilers hockey team and Everton Football Club.

Olympic double gold medal-winner Mo Farah made his debut in the London marathon last year, finishing eighth, and admitted the 26.2-mile course was the toughest challenge of his career.
Kenyan world-record holder Wilson Kipsang finished first, smashing the course record with a time of two hours, four minutes and 29 seconds to claim his second London title in three years.
