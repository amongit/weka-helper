Selma Anniversary: How Much Has Black Life Really Changed In 50 Years? (INFOGRAPHIC)
On March 7, 1965, protesters marched along Alabama's Edmund Pettus Bridge on a mission led by Martin Luther King Jr. and guided by his goal to achieve fair voting rights.
Fifty years later, that bridge -- and that goal -- still remain, reminding us that the fight for equality for African-Americans still isn't over.
The nation is remembering Selma this year amid the backdrop of the recent events in Ferguson, Missouri -- another incident that highlights how much work still needs to be done when it comes to racial divides in the country. Protesters in Ferguson have called for an end to police practices that disproportionately affect African-Americans, and a scathing report released on Wednesday by the Department of Justice that looked at racial profiling in Ferguson's police department showed just how real these disparities are.
To many, Selma epitomizes many of the racial and justice issues black Americans have faced in the past, and reflects some of problems that still exist today. The historic march also broadly symbolizes the strength of the civil rights movement and the power of social activism.
Even as the nation continues to deal with the harsh realities of racism today, the quality of life for black Americans has improved in many ways since Selma's "Bloody Sunday" 50 years ago. But we still have a long way to go. As the ceremonies begin this weekend to celebrate the landmark civil rights march, it is important to reflect on the progress -- or a lack of it -- that's occurred when it comes to true racial justice and equality for all African-Americans.
How far have we really come? And, how far do we still have to go?
We here at The Huffington Post have put together a chart to help you decide.
