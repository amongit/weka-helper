Round 2: FCC Net Neutrality Comments Stem Largely From One Source - US News
The Federal Communications Commission sought public comments regarding new policies on net neutrality earlier this year, reportedly receiving over 3.5 million submissions.
But new analysis from the Sunlight Foundation on the second round of comments received questions the FCC's numbers. "At this point, there's a difference of 1,124,656 between what the FCC is reporting and what we counted in the files the agency provided," the group wrote.
Some pro-net neutrality groups said they submitted more comments than appeared in the Sunlight Foundation's calculations from the FCC files.
While we reported that only 1 percent of comments in the first round opposed net neutrality, anti-net neutrality comments represented 60 percent of comments in the second round. The Sunlight Foundation attributed this difference largely to one form letter campaign spearheaded by the anti-big government group American Commitment.
The letter-writing campaign by American Commitment was responsible for more than half of second-round comments, the Sunlight Foundation said. The group was behind at least 30 different varieties of responses submitted by commenters, which could have been an attempt to evade form letter groupings, according to the foundation.
"The new campaigns on the anti-net neutrality side appear to have been crafted to use similar language to the successful pro-neutrality campaigns of the first round, while supporting opposite conclusions," the foundation wrote in a blog post.
