5 political stories to make your Sunday better
You could be forgiven for thinking that the only things that happened this week in politics were Hillary Clinton's e-mail news conference, the Republican senators' open letter to Iran and yet another Secret Service scandal. But, amid all of that drudgery, there were a few rays of sunshine, too. Here's our weekly roundup of political news to make you smile. 1. A South Carolina state lawmaker sang " on the House floor. As Roger Kirby, a Democrat, says in the video above, he played Jean Valjean recently (who hasn't?) and so when another lawmaker asked him to sing something from "Les Miserables," he did. According to Carolinalive.com, Kirby's song came during a dinner break as the state House debated the "nearly $7 billion state budget." In addition to being a state legislator, Kirby is also a real estate appraiser and a minister of music, according to Carolina Live. A real Renaissance man! 2. Joe Biden did bicep curls while on the phone. This has to be seen — and seen (and then seen again) to be believed. The goal of the Vine video — aside from the forced implosion of the Internet — was to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the "Let's Move"campaign by urging people to do five repetitions of an exercise and then passing it on to a friend. 3. . Will T. Scott, a retired state Supreme Court justice and little-known Republican candidate for governor this fall in the Bluegrass State, has come up with a novel way to get people to pay attention to his plan for veterans. He's going to present it after jumping out of an airplane. "Scott said he is qualified to jump from a plane but declined to say how long it has been since his last jump," wrote the Lexington Herald Leader's Sam Youngman. "The only difference between jumping now and when he was a paratrooper, Scott said, is 'the difference between driving an old dilapidated pick-up truck and a Ferrari.'" 4. Rep. Aaron Schock, man of the people. The Illinois Republican, under fire for his lavish lifestyle and tendency to bill taxpayers for it, is making a not-at-all-subtle attempt of late to show that he's just a regular Aaron. The latest?
