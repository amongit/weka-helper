Delhi elections: Nobody better than Kiran Bedi to lead BJP, says Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that nobody was better than Kiran Bedi to lead the BJP in Delhi Assembly elections. He also said the main agenda in the campaign is governance versus anarchy.
"Nobody was better than Kiran Bedi to lead BJP in Delhi elections....The primary issue in campaign is governance versus anarchy. The BJP reflects development and governance while AAP is a reflection of Anarchy," he told CNN-IBN.
Talking about the opinion polls, majority of which have predicted victory for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Finance Minister said they can only show a direction and that all of them may not be accurate.
Claiming that the BJP would win with a comfortable majority, Jaitley said the party was concentrating on the final polls.
In his view, the Delhi elections have become bipolar as the Congress has diminished. "The Congress has not learnt from its past. It will have its own slice of vote but I do not see them picking up a considerable number of votes," he said.
Jaitley said the BJP went strictly by the Constitution and it did not link the decision on election in Delhi to winnability. "I am certain that all agencies are conscious of their statutory responsibilities," he said.
On the alleged bogus funding to AAP, the Finance Minister said AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal is himself a former revenue officer and knows the rules well as far as investigation is concerned. "A company gives Rs 2 crore in party fund. AAP should answer," he said.
Speaking about Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu's statement that the Delhi election is not a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jaitley said, "It is an election for Delhi and Delhi's chief minister and it will be decided by the people of Delhi."
