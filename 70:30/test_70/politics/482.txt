Millions More People Are Getting Health Insurance Because Of Obamacare, Survey Finds
Nearly one week after White House enrollment numbers showed Obamacare surpassing the seven-million mark, an economist-driven survey is projecting more good news for the Affordable Care Act.
RAND Corporation released its findings Tuesday, showing that the health care law is poised to spur a net gain of 9.3 million more insured Americans. The survey results were collected through March 28, 2014, and respondents will be part of a follow-up later in April, once new data is available.
The survey adds that thanks to shifts caused by circumstances like job and marital status changes, the study cannot pinpoint which shifts were specifically driven by Obamacare's arrival. But limited conclusions can be drawn, including an estimate that the share of uninsured Americans will drop from 20.5 percent to 15.8 percent. RAND Corporation's numbers arrive one day after Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Nebraska Senate candidate Ben Sasse (R) penned an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, warning Republicans that there is urgency to create alternatives to Obamacare.
"The good news is that the final chapter on the presidentâ€™s disastrous health insurance takeover has not been written," they wrote. "Conservatives are making a strong comeback with concrete proposals that, if enacted, would create real progress toward better healthcare outcomes for all Americans."
