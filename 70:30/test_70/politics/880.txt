Cheney: I'd Do It Again
Former Vice President Dick Cheney is leading the charge against Senate Democrats who released a report condemning the use of harsh CIA interrogations of suspected terrorists.
Cheney denied that such techniques amounted to torture, as the Democrat-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee charged in report last week.

"Torture, to me ... is an American citizen on his cellphone making a last call to his four young daughters shortly before he burns to death in the upper levels of the Trade Center in New York on 9/11," Cheney told NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday. "There's this notion that there's moral equivalence between what the terrorists did and what we do, and that's absolutely not true. We were very careful to stop short of torture."
Cheney has defended the interrogation techniques ever since he was vice president for President George W. Bush from 2001-2009.
Defending his role in creating the program, which included waterboarding and restraining prisoners in painful positions, Cheney said, "I'd do it again in a minute." He said the program generated intelligence that saved lives. "It worked," he added.

He said the Senate Intelligence Committee report was a partisan document, and he said the Justice Department had approved the techniques.
But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, responded to Cheney on Twitter. "Torture didn't work," she wrote, according to Politico. "CIA personnel 'disturbed' by use of torture, 'some to the point of tears and choking up.'"
