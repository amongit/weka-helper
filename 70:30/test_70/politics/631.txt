Behind the Numbers in Forbes' Billionaires List
If the world’s billionaires got together to form their own super country, their $7.05 trillion combined net worth would be eclipsed only by the national economic output of China and the United States.
Forbes on Monday issued its 29th annual who’s-who list of the world’s wealthiest, and this year a record 1,826 people with at least a $1 billion fortune made the cut. Bill Gates, with the help of his $79.2 billion net worth, took home the title of world’s wealthiest man for the 16th time in the last 21 years.

A reported 290 people made Forbes’ 10-figure catalog in 2015 for the first time, with freshmen billionaires the likes of basketball icon Michael Jordan, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and video game designer and “Minecraft” creator Markus Persson.
But technology fields were overshadowed this year by the food and beverage industry, which fostered the most first-time billionaires of any industry. New additions to the list include the likes of Rockstar energy drink creator Russ Weiner, Monster Beverage Company CEO Rodney Sacks and Chick-fil-A’s Dan and Bubba Cathy.

The manufacturing sector added 38 billionaires to the list in 2015, while 34 broke the billion-dollar-cap in health care-related ventures.
Here’s a breakdown of the numbers to take away from Forbes’ list of Billionaires:
Nearly three in 10 of the world’s billionaires are from the United States – 131 of whom live in California.
China trails the U.S. with 213 billionaires, followed by Germany with 103, India with 90 and Russia with 88.
China added the most billionaires in 2015 (71), followed by the U.S. (57) and India (28). Russia, on the other hand, saw the most nationals drop below the $1 billion cut off from the year before. Of the 138 people who dropped out of Forbes’ list this year from 2014, 28 were Russian, as the country struggles with low energy prices and international sanctions.
Fashion designer Michael Kors and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko are among the most notable ultra-wealthy to fall beneath the billion-dollar-benchmark and fail to make the cut in 2015.
A record of nearly 200 women made Forbes’ list of billionaires this year, up from 172 in 2014. The U.S. contributed 67 members to the list, while 19 hailed from Germany and 13 came from Brazil.
Christy Walton, the world’s wealthiest woman and No. 8 on the main list, has a net worth of $41.7 billion. Walton is one of four Walmart heirs and heiresses to crack the top 20 list of the world’s wealthiest people, whose combined net worth reaches $160.8 billion.
A reported 230 of the world’s 1,826 billionaires inherited their fortunes, while 1,191 are self made and another 405 inherited some of their fortunes but are actively working to increase their wealth.
A record 46 members of the Forbes list are younger than 40 years old. Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel, 24, is the youngest member of the billionaires’ club, having just made the cut for the first time this year with a fortune of $1.5 billion. Fellow Snapchat co-founder Bobby Murphy, 25, is the second-youngest and also carries a $1.5 billion net worth.
Mark Zuckerberg, 30, Facebook co-founder and richest of the under 40 age bracket, has an estimated net worth of $33.4 billion, making him the 16th wealthiest person in the world.
The average age of the world’s top 20 richest individuals – who have a net worth of at least $29.2 billion – is 60 years old. Zuckerberg is the youngest by 11 years to break into the top 20.
The oldest billionaire on the list is David Rockefeller Sr., 99, who commands a $3 billion fortune, mostly garnered through oil and banking activities.
Among the world’s wealthiest, 20 individuals made their fortunes crafting casino and gambling games. Another four billionaires got rich through video game development.
Persson, creator of the wildly popular “Minecraft” video game, made the list for the first time in 2015 with a net worth of $1.3 billion.
Only six billionaires in this industry hail from the U.S. Five of the 24 billionaires are from Hong Kong, while another three are from Japan.
Nearly 20 of the world’s richest found their fortunes in a bottle, with 12 billionaires tied specifically to breweries.
Sierra Nevada Brewing Company founder Ken Grossman is among 2015’s newcomers, joining the likes of Yuengling president and heir Richard Yuengling Jr. and Boston Beer Company co-founder and chairman Jim Koch.
