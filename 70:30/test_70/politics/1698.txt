Democrats Had A Sweet Response For Republicans Who Celebrated Texas' Gay Marriage Ban
Texas Democrats weren’t too fond of a cake-eating celebration Republicans held to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the state’s same-sex marriage ban, so they responded this week with some treats of their own.
Last month, Texas Republicans held a cake-cutting ceremony with the conservative group Texas Values to commemorate Texas Faith and Family Day, along with the state's constitutional amendment against gay marriage, the Advocate reported. The dessert was a white and pink sheet cake decorated with the words "10th Anniversary of 2005 Marriage Act."
On Wednesday, the Texas Democratic Party decided to bring their own cakes to the offices of lawmakers, such as Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Sen. Donna Campbell, who had participated in the get-together. Their cakes featured a rainbow-colored Texas with a pink heart, and the cards read, "Love Is Love."

In a Facebook post, the group noted that not all Texans are against same-sex marriage.
"A few weeks ago, several Republican lawmakers celebrated Texas' ban on same-sex marriage by eating wedding cake," their post read. "Today, we stopped by the offices of Dan Patrick, Donna Campbell and several other Texas lawmakers to remind them that the majority of Texans support the freedom to marry, and to drop off cakes of our own!"
Who says revenge can't be sweet?
