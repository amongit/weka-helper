The Inevitable Candidate
Hillary Clinton may be the first nonincumbent presidential candidate in the modern era to, in effect, be coronated as her party’s nominee.
And on balance, this is likely to weaken her for the general election in November 2016. So far, she has a huge lead in the polls over all her potential Democratic rivals, such as Vice President Joe Biden, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. None of them strikes party strategists as a strong contender.

Sailing through the nomination process may be temporarily satisfying for Clinton and her allies, but it may prevent her and her organization from becoming battletested in time for the general election campaign. It also places Clinton, if she runs as expected, in an extremely visible and vulnerable position from which she can be attacked by the Republicans.
Already, Clinton is the main target for the GOP in the 2016 race. “It speaks volumes that Hillary Clinton will gladly attend fancy galas yet continues to hide from the American people,” argued Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, in an email to reporters. “Voters deserve to know why she didn’t pay women equally in her Senate office, and why she only used private email while serving as secretary of state at the same time the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments who were lobbying her State Department.” Moore was referring to Clinton’s attendance Tuesday at a gala sponsored by Emily’s List, an organization that aims to elect Democratic women to political office. Clinton didn’t announce her candidacy at the event but she did signal her intentions when she said to the adoring crowd, “Don’t you someday want to see a woman president?” The line drew loud applause, according to the Associated Press.
The RNC also referred to a growing controversy that erupted around Clinton this week, based on a New York Times report that she exclusively used personal email accounts while she was secretary of state, rather than using government accounts, to conduct official business. Adding to Clinton’s embarrassment, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters there was “very specific guidance” that members of the Obama administration should use government email accounts for official purposes. Those government accounts are more easily accessible to members of Congress and others keeping tabs on officials’ decisions and job performance.
Last year, Clinton aides turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department after the department asked in writing for the communications. But critics pointed out the transfer came only after Clinton had left her job as secretary of state and only after the department formally requested the documents. Congressional Republicans wondered if all the emails had really been turned over.

More broadly, critics said it’s a familiar pattern for Clinton – excessive secrecy and an attitude that she is entitled to do things differently than others.
There’s another concern among Democrats – that being such an overwhelming front runner will encourage the kind of internal feuding that plagued Clinton’s 2008 campaign, when she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.
A prominent Democratic strategist who has worked for the Clintons says the evolving Clinton team has been focused on developing a political organization, improving its technological potential, building a polling operation, and putting a fundraising structure in place, but there has been no discernible progress in clarifying Clinton’s overall policies and formulating a comprehensive message. The former first lady seems to be mainly concerned with bringing in advisers who supported her and President Bill Clinton in the past, and adding people who backed President Obama or who admire the aggressively liberal approach being taken by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. “She has less freedom of action to write her own ticket than her husband had,” the strategist says. “Bill Clinton represented a hostile takeover [of the Democratic party]. At this point, she owns the Democratic Party. The question is how is she going to keep all the employes happy.”
Team Hillary is attempting to “appeal to the Clintonians, the Obamians, and the Warrenites,” the strategist says. “I hope it doesn’t turn out to be the bar scene from ‘Star Wars.’”
