How Hillary Clinton and Her Team Decided to Throw Out 31,830 Emails
The big headline from Hillary Clinton’s news conference Tuesday was that, although she claims to have turned over all work-related emails, she deleted the rest of her emails and it appears there is no way to read them ever again.
But one important point regarding how her team determined which of Clinton's 62,320 e-mails were work-related and which were “personal and private” may have been glossed over.






A new Time magazine cover story about the email scandal boiled down the exact process she used in responding to a State Department request for her emails related to official business and pointed out that each individual e-mail was not read.
"This review did not involve opening and reading each email," Time reported. "Instead, Clinton’s lawyers created a list of names and keywords related to her work and searched for those. Slightly more than half the total cache -- 31,830 emails -- did not contain any of the search terms, according to Clinton’s staff, so they were deemed to be 'private, personal records.'”
Time didn't disclose how it determined that each email wasn't opened individually, but it’s consistent with a written explanation provided by Clinton's spokesman after a news conference this week.
Clinton's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During the news conference, Clinton did not go into the details of how the review was conducted, but said it was “thorough” and that she went “above and beyond” what she was required to do in turning over many of her emails to the State Department.
"We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department," she said, adding that all other emails were personal and pertained to matters such as "yoga routines," "family vacations," and "planning Chelsea's wedding."
But later, after the news conference, Clinton’s team distributed a lengthy question-and-answer document that detailed the “multi-step” process. The process appeared to have included an extensive, nuanced search of Clinton’s inbox, but the document did not make clear how many of the emails were opened and read in the review.
According to that document, here is a summary of how Clinton’s attorneys, who were tasked with the job, said they sorted through:

The results of the searching were that Clinton’s attorneys found 30,490 work-related emails and 31,830 emails that were deemed “private and personal.”
Clinton said on Tuesday she deleted all of the personal emails because she felt she “had no reason to save them.”
