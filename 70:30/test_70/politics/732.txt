Taking a Bow
If the stately Senate is like the theater, the colorful House is like the circus.
The Senate drama rose to rare heights last week at the end of a dull, uninspiring year for avid Senate-goers. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid knows he is taking one last bow before a different cast takes over in early January. To his credit, he scheduled vote after vote after vote into Saturday and late into the night, setting the stage for the surgeon general, State Department and other Obama administration nominees to receive confirmation.
Such scenes are perfectly "in character" for the tenacious Reid, a savvy, no-frills man who will never go down without a fight. The man from Searchlight, Nevada, proudly says he used to be a boxer and a Capitol Police cop in his younger days. He enjoys having the upper hand in the upper chamber, and when all the votes were going his way, he got giddy late at night. He advised the presiding officer that "we'll let you know" about the time of upcoming votes on Monday morning, lapsing into informal shorthand in a legislative body that observes decorum.

A different character, but a character nonetheless, is Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. An old-school, crafty Southerner, he likes to win as much as Reid does. There are not many policies he will go to the wall for, except for keeping coal-mining safe from the law. But he is an excellent parliamentarian who will give as good as he got when he becomes majority leader next year.
The backstory that Washington is all agog about: Reid was relishing the moment that Republicans were tied up over their defiant young tea partier Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. By a procedural twist, Cruz gave Reid extra time to shine in his leader role. Clever and confrontational, Cruz might make most senators' lists as the villain of the piece. He's a freshman senator – a group that used to know their place in the chamber.
I confess, I have always loved the stage. From my Senate intern days for the marvelous maverick character, then-Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., I enjoyed hearing the Senate floor debate live, all the various voices piped in live on the radio. The senior aides in our Dirksen office could identify all 100 voices – and, yes, they were virtually all men. We three interns were paid to open the mail and write genocide speeches in the afternoon: "Prox" had vowed todeliver one every day until the United States became party to the Genocide Convention.

Writing lines that a senator would speak on the floor into the record! Smelling salts. This enhanced the effect of political theater early on, when I was quite impressionable.
The weekend vote-o-rama allowed for backstage merriment. Several Senate Democats, including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Barbara Boxer of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bob Menendez of New Jersey sang Christmas carols as Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan played the piano. "Truly a memorable experience," tweeted Booker, a young senator and former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, with outsize leading man talent. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, also joined in. Ain't that sweet after a bitter year?
The sleeper Republican senator with a heap of talent that has not been discovered on the national stage is tall John Thune of South Dakota, who will turn 54 in January. If you ask me. He's a hard campaigner anyway, upsetting then-Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle ten years ago.
Finally, I note with sorrow that three wise men are retiring after decades of service: Senate Democrats Carl Levin of Michigan, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Tom Harkin of Iowa. They are elders whose seasoning will be missed early next year. But, as the Bard wrote, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances."
