A Return to Race-Baiting
The Democrats have never really had to pay a price for “Jim Crow,” the legal structure they imposed and defended for decades that kept the American South segregated by race during the period between the end of Reconstruction and the passage of federal civil rights legislation beginning in 1964. Instead, it is the Republicans who are accused of being the party that tries – and has for decades succeeded – to obtain political advantage by pitting whites against blacks.
First, it was former President Richard Nixon’s so-called “Southern Strategy,” which liberal historians have defined as blatant appeals along racial lines to voters in the states of the old Confederacy to pull them into the GOP column. There are many faults with the theory – the least of which is that Democrats were already leaving the party for a host of reasons related to cultural issues and not just race by 1968, when Nixon defeated both Vice President Hubert Humphrey and segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace to win the presidency. It is accepted as fact so much that Bush 43-era Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman once issued a public apology for it.
Whatever the reality, Mehlman’s apology was part of a pushback against a perception that is, for the moment, fixed that the GOP uses race to drive voters to the polls. Now that may change, especially as the Democrats become increasingly bold in the use of both blatant and coded messages to persuade their voters to turn out.

Exhibit A in the new reality is a flyer distributed by a “concerned citizens” group in North Carolina, where Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis is on track to oust Democrat Kay Hagan from her seat in the U.S. Senate after only one term.
Without Hagan, the Democrats will have a difficult time maintaining a majority in the U.S. Senate. That fact alone may be the “end justifies the means” rationale for the flyer, which shows a black-and-white photo of a lynch mob. It’s about as subtle as a kick in the head by an angry mule, with the words “Kay Hagan DOESN’T win! Obama’s IMPEACHMENT will begin! Vote in 2014” superimposed over it.
Both parties have denounced the flyer, but it’s not the only obvious racial appeal Democrats are using in the race. A super PAC tied to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, is up with a radio spot tying Tillis to the racially charged Trayvon Martin case.
“Tillis won’t fight for us. Instead, he made it harder for communities of color to vote by restricting early voting and voter registration. Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin,” the ad says.

As The New Yorker’s Jay Caspian Kang explains, the ad not only race-baits, it’s misleading. “The Trayvon Martin ad, which is clearly targeted at black voters, relies on a fallacy – that it was Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law alone that compelled [George] Zimmerman to shoot Martin, and, by extension, that anyone who supported a similar law in North Carolina would be enabling future George Zimmermans,” Kang writes, adding parenthetically that “Zimmerman’s lawyers did not invoke ‘Stand Your Ground’ in his defense, though jurors may have considered it in their decisions to acquit him.”
“Democrats are getting desperate and resorting to the most shameful tactics to drive voter turnout through fear, [using] race-baiting innuendo [and] attempting to link Republicans to the recent police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri (under a Democratic governor, it might be noted) and the killing of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida,” says Phil Kerpen, head of the conservative group American Commitment.
He and his group are pushing back against the attacks on Tillis in North Carolina, where American Commitment is up with a radio spot of its own calling out the Democrats on their tactics. “Democrats know what they are doing is wrong, so the attacks appear surreptitiously; the radio ad by Harry Reid’s super PAC attempting to link Thom Tillis to Trayvon Martin is nowhere on the group’s website, social media accounts or YouTube channel,” says the Brooklyn-born Kerpen, a Jew who was raised in the ethnic polyglot of pregentrification Sunset Park.

Kerpen is right on moral as well as political grounds that Republicans and conservatives need to address the issue head on and fight back before the tactic is allowed to spread or become further institutionalized.
In Maryland, where Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, a black Democrat, is in a closer-than-expected race for governor against Republican Larry Hogan, the state Democratic Party is sending out mailers invoking the death of Michael Brown as a reason to go vote.
These mailers and mailers like them exploit the tragedy in Ferguson for political purposes. “We cannot allow these shameful efforts to smear conservatives and distract from the serious policy issues the country faces to stand,” Kerpen says. His group is preparing to send out similar messages “in any other states where the Reid super PAC (funded by liberal billionaires Tom Steyer, Fred Eychaner and Mike Bloomberg) is resorting to race-baiting.”
It’s not so much an issue of whether these flyers are true; it only matters that people – black voters in particular who may not yet be enthusiastic about voting on Nov. 4 – believe they are true and that they have the desired effect: to have Democrats elected on a lie.
