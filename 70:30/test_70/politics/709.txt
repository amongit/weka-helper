How Much Does Your Uber Driver Make?
If you own a car in a major city, driving for a ride-sharing service may seem like an easy way to make a few bucks. But how much would you need to drive to live off a salary as an Uber driver?
NerdWallet used data from SherpaShare to calculate how much drivers need to work to make certain incomes after paying for gas, insurance and car maintenance.
Uber drivers make the most money (pretax) per ride, on average – $15.97, compared with $13.35 for Sidecar and $11.48 for Lyft.
Where you live also pays a role. Lyft drivers in Dallas make the least money per trip, which means they would have to provide 97.65 rides before paying for the city's average annual car insurance premium. ​
