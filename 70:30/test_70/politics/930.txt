ALEC Wins Big in Ethics Case
The beleaguered but battling-back American Legislative Exchange Council has won a major victory in the state of Minnesota that may force its opponents to rewrite the narrative they have been using to try to destroy it.
Up to know, the liberal groups that oppose ALEC’s work – which is to develop sensible, pro-free market policies at the state level by providing a forum for legislators and job creators to meet and exchange ideas – have been attacking it with one hand, calling it a vehicle for special interests and a secretive lobby group, while trying to replicate it with the other. Their latest effort involves the combination of at least three different groups doing similar things into one organization whose objective is to move policy at the state level to the left, while ALEC has been pushing back against allegations its activities in support of market-based public policy solutions has somehow been unethical.
In a victory for ALEC – and for the rights of all Americans under the First Amendment – the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board exonerated the group of any wrongdoing in what has been one of the longest running ethics complaints in the history of the state.

For more than two years the board has been considering a complaint made by Common Cause Minnesota that ALEC lobbies extensively, serves private rather than charitable interests and, as such, violated state law when the group and its individual staffers failed to register with the ethics board.
In an interesting side note, since one of the consistent complaints against ALEC has been that it uses a cookie-cutter approach to the drafting of model legislation, it is worth noting that the Common Cause Minnesota complaint appears to have been taken directly from one filed by Common Cause in 2011 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
The board released its findings on February 3, concluding that:
Minnesota is a test case for the group and its opponents going forward. The ethics laws in Minnesota are among the most stringent in the United States, and if the complaint failed there it is likely to fail elsewhere as well.

In the long view, the left’s efforts to shut down conservative groups with whom they disagree while trying to replicate their activities will still be with us for some time. It runs counter to the essential American idea that people have the right to be wrong, that ideas are for debate, and that public policy is best crafted by consensus. The use (abuse, really) of the ethics process and the legal system to criminalize differences in approach to the problems the country faces speaks to a sort of intellectual bankruptcy on the part of those who oppose conservatism. The best answers will be found through a vigorous argument waged on all sides because, after all, public policy fights are not about putting points on the board so much as they are about doing what is right and best for the people.
