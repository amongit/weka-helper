Delhi Assembly elections: Comparative view of AAP, Congress manifestos; BJP's vision document
New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress have released their manifestos for Delhi Assembly elections while the BJP came out with its vision document instead of a manifesto. The BJP's vision document was released on Tuesday, just four days before elections while the Congress released its second manifesto on Tuesday itself.
Issues like zero tolerance towards corruption, reduction of electricity bills, women's security and installation of CCTV cameras in residential colonies and in buses find mention in the election promises of all the three political parties.
The BJP and AAP also promise reduction of water rates. The BJP and Congress talk of increasing the number of power distribution companies in order to give options to the consumers. They also mention regularization of unauthorized colonies.
Granting full-fledged statehood to Delhi and increasing the number of schools and colleges have been promised by AAP and Congress.
Housing for all, making Yamuna pollution-free and scrapping BRT are some of the issues mentioned only by the BJP as some of their promises.
Passage of Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill within 15 days of coming to power and making Delhi a free wi-fi zone are some of the promises made only by AAP.
