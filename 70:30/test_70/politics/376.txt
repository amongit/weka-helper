Delhi elections: BJP hits out at Kejriwal, demands reply on 'bogus' funding to AAP
New Delhi: The BJP on Wednesday once again lashed out at Aam Aadmi Party and its chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal over the alleged funding and asked them to reply to the questions being asked by it.
Talking to mediapersons, Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that Kejriwal is running away from answering to their questions over the alleged money-laundering and bogus funding to AAP. He praised the media for investigating the matter.
He said though Kejriwal boasts of making the nation corruption-free, the company and address mentioned which had donated to AAP are fictitious. "There are some 30 directors and the addresses are wrong. These companies are nowhere to be seen and they give donations as high as Rs 50 lakh," he said.
He demanded replies from Kejriwal on these queries. He asked AAP to explain the source of money. He asked Kejriwal to stand by the standards that he has set for himself.
Prasad also apologised for the use of 'immigrant' word in respect to the North-eastern people in the BJP's vision document released on Tuesday and said it was a printing error. "The BJP has firmly believed that our sisters and brothers from the North-East India are dear to us and we support them," he said.
