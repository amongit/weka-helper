St Helens captain Jon Wilkin has agreed a one-year contract extension until the end of the 2016 season.
The 31-year-old joined Saints from Hull KR in 2002 but missed last season's Grand Final win with a shoulder injury.
Forward Wilkin replaced Paul Wellens as skipper this year and has led the Super League champions to a 100% start to their season.
"This club has been an important part of my life and it is a natural thing to extend my contract," said Wilkin.
"I have had some of the best memories of my life here and I'm looking forward to continuing that for the next couple of seasons.
"Being captain is a role I am proud of. My remit is to now highlight and bring through some of the next leaders at the club."
Wilkin, who has won 12 trophies during his time at Saints, has appeared 310 times for the club, scoring 86 tries and kicking two drop goals.
St Helens head coach Keiron Cunningham has also confirmed that centre Mark Percival is facing six weeks out with a knee injury, while long-term absentee Luke Walsh is still three weeks away from fitness.
