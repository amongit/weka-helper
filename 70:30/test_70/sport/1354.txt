Andy Murray and Jamie Murray to team-up to take on Bryan brothers at Davis Cup

As predicted by the Telegraph last month, a fraternal doubles showdown between the Murray brothers and the Bryan twins is poised to take place in Glasgow the weekend after next. Leon Smith, Great Britain’s Davis Cup captain, this morning recalled Jamie Murray to the squad for what is likely to be his first appearance in the competition since 2011.
This first-round meeting with the USA will also be the first World Group match that Great Britain have played at home since 2002, and it has generated huge interest on both sides of the border. The 7,000 seats at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow sold out in minutes when they went on the market in November.
Smith’s four-man team is completed by Britain’s second-best singles player, James Ward, plus Dominic Inglot as an alternative doubles option. The USA have not yet named their own team but their top singles option is clearly John Isner, ranked at No. 20 in the world, and then their captain Jim Courier faces a tricky decision over whether to bring in Sam Querrey, Steve Johnson or Donald Young as the back-up man.
All three have rankings in the 40s, with Querrey standing the highest at 40 exactly. But Querrey has lost both his previous matches against Ward, most memorably in last year’s equivalent Davis Cup match in San Diego in February, and that must count as a point against him.
There are a couple of scenarios in which Inglot could come into play in Glasgow, and break up the likely Murray-Murray double act. The first is if Andy Murray is forced into a draining five-set battle on the opening day of the tie by the USA’s second-string choice – whoever that may be – and then needs to recover his energies.

The second would be if Ward manages an upset over Isner – and this is not totally out of the question, despite a rankings gap of 88 places, for Ward did win an exhibition between the two of them at Melbourne’s Kooyong Country Club last month. This would probably leave Great Britain with a 2-0 lead after the first day, and in that instance, Smith might be tempted to rest Andy Murray on the Saturday. Playing all three days of a Davis Cup match is notoriously demanding.
"I'm happy and proud to be back in the Davis Cup team," said Jamie Murray. "It's been seven years since I last played a World Group match so to be playing at home in Glasgow will make it extra special."
Kyle Edmund, the promising 20-year-old who won his first Challenger title last month, will also travel to Glasgow as Great Britain’s reserve player.
"We've been able to choose our strongest possible team, which is of course spearheaded by Andy Murray who is significantly ahead of where he was 12 months ago," said Leon Smith.
"The tie will be a huge deal for him personally as he returns to play in Scotland for the first time since winning Wimbledon in 2013.
“In James Ward we have somebody who has already proven himself against the US Davis Cup team, and I'd back him again to put in another excellent performance after some consistent recent form has seen him on the verge of cracking the top 100 for the first time.
"I've selected our top two doubles players in Jamie and Dom, and again they've showed real consistency this year to earn their place in the team."
