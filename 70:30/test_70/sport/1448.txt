Exeter captain Dean Mumm is to leave the club at the end of the season.
The 31-year-old second row is returning to his former team, the New South Wales Waratahs, after three seasons away.
Mumm, who won 33 caps for Australia, has been Chiefs captain for the past two seasons and led them to victory in last season's LV= Cup final, the club's first major trophy.
Exeter have already signed England and British Lions forward Geoff Parling, who looks set to be his replacement.

"We're absolutely delighted that Dean will be coming back to the Waratahs," chief executive Greg Harris told the club website.
"To have a player of his experience and reputation will be a great asset for the team.
"Dean has had a very successful career, both previously at the Waratahs and during his stint with Exeter Chiefs, and we're very fortunate to be able to have someone with his playing experience and leadership skills back at the club.
"It is also an important reversal of the current trend of Australian players going overseas to pursue their careers".
