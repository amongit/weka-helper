USA v Finland: Americans humbled as Finland win 5-0 to claim men's ice hockey bronze at Sochi 2014

Finland's men's ice hockey team secured Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics bronze in emphatic fashion on Saturday as they thumped the United States 5-0 at the Bolshoy Ice Dome.
After an evenly-matched first period in which Patrick Kane's penalty shot for the US was missed, the Finns opened the scoring in the second minute of the second period as 43-year-old captain Teemu Selanne slotted in across Jonathan Quick.
The lead was extended just 11 seconds later, with Jussi Jokinen receiving the puck from Jori Lehtera and firing past Quick, before Kane experienced more penalty shot woe in the seventh minute of the session as his attempt hit the post.
Certainly it did not appear to be the Americans' day - something that was left in no doubt by the action in the third period.
Juuso Hietanen made it 3-0 in the seventh minute by sending an effort from distance through a crowd of players and into the net.

Finland then wrapped things up with two power play goals, Selanne being on hand to put away his second goal of the game from Mikael Granlund's pass in the 10th minute, and Olli Maatta smashing in number five in the 14th.
