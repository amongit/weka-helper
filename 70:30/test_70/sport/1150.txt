Woodbridge recorded the second fastest time in the swimming, his strongest event, to move up from equal 13th after the morning’s fencing.
“Nick was a bit disappointed with his swim, as he expected to go two seconds faster,” said British team manager Dominic Mahony. “However, he is still in a strong position.”
No British man has won an individual Olympic medal in the sport since its introduction in 1912, but the 26-year-old Woodbridge, from Telford, is this country’s best chance since Richard Phelps finished fourth and sixth at Los Angeles and Seoul in the 1980s.
Ranked ninth in the world, he will go into the afternoon’s showjumping test needing to finish in the top three or four to put himself in with a chance of a medal. But unlike many pentathletes, who have backgrounds in running or swimming and pick up the other disciplines later in life, Woodbridge has been riding since childhood. He first rode a horse aged three, and was a member of the Pony Club by age 12.
For the first time at an Olympic Games, there is no separate shooting competition. Instead, the pistol shooting has been incorporated into the final event, the 3km run, with athletes required at 1km intervals to hit a certain number of targets before they can continue running. The run will be handicapped, with points translated into time advantage and the athlete in first place setting off first.

Farah's moment of truth
There is a surprise leader of the men’s event: Cao Zhongrong, of China, who performed well on home turf at the last World Cup event in May but was not expected to challenge here. Instead, he came equal second in the fencing and third in the swimming for a total of 2,376 points, 48 ahead of David Svoboda, of the Czech Republic, in second.
Woodbridge is 172 points behind Cao, which would translate to a 43-second handicap in the combined event. Pre-race favourites, Aleksander Lesun and Andrei Moiseev, of Russia, are menacingly poised in third and fourth. The other Briton in the field, Sam Weale, is 14th.
The day has already seen two Olympic records. Svoboda equalled the Olympic record in the day’s first event, the fencing round robin, by winning 26 out of his 35 one-minute bouts. In the pool, Amro El Geziry recorded a time of 1min 55.70sec for the 200 metres freestyle, knocking 0.16sec off his own record from Beijing.
