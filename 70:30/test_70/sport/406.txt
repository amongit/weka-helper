Rory McIlroy choice to represent his biggest fans at the 2016 Olympics in Rio delights the Irish

The agonising is finally over – Rory McIlroy will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and not, as he hinted two years ago, take up the opportunity to play for Team GB.
McIlroy’s announcement was well timed, coming on the eve of the Irish Open at Fota Island in Cork, where he appears in the first round on Thursday. Breaking press-room protocol, the Irish media applauded when McIlroy, appropriately decked in a green polo shirt, revealed his decision. Like the golfer, they had probably become fed up with the subject, which had dominated the Olympic golf agenda since the sport was readmitted to the Games five years ago.
“I’ve been thinking about it a lot,” McIlroy said. “I don’t know whether it’s been because the World Cup has been in Brazil and I’ve been thinking a couple of years down the line. I won great amateur titles representing Ireland and I kept thinking: ‘Why change that?’ I was always very proud to put on the Irish uniform and I would be very proud to do it again.”
Asked if he had been “torn” on the issue, McIlroy replied: “More worried about what other people would think, rather than me. But you’ve got to do what’s right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with, and ultimately that was the decision that I made.”
This was a decision plainly made out of emotion, made out of the knowledge what it would have meant to the normal Irish golf fan if he had selected Team GB. He discovered how deep the feelings ran when suggesting he was swaying towards appearing under the Union Flag. “The fact is I’ve always felt more British than Irish,” he said, in an unguarded moment.

The backlash was inevitable, although McIlroy did not anticipate its ferocity. The Dublin talkshows went into overdrive and criticism rained in, predominantly because he received funding from the Golfing Union of Ireland before turning professional in 2007.
“Just because I’m playing golf for money and I’m a professional I’m supposed to have this choice or this decision to make, where if you look at the rugby players, cricketers or hockey players, they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf.”
McIlroy said Graeme McDowell was in the same boat, but was clear he wanted the authorities to take the decision out of his hands. When Peter Dawson, the R&A chief executive, revealed last year that the authorities intended to do just that, saying that if a player had appeared in the World Cup of Golf for Ireland then that is who he should play for, everybody welcomed the moved. Everybody but McIlroy, that is.
“There was a lot of people giving their opinion and what they think I should do,” he said. “But at the end of the day it’s a decision that I had to make for myself because it’s something that you have to live with. It’s taken me long enough to sort of get over the hurdle, but it’s definitely the right decision.”
There were three options as far as McIlroy was concerned: Ireland, Team GB ... or to skip the Olympics. The last option must have been tempting as the pressure grew on him to show his hand. But in the end he was convinced by those who wanted him the most. It meant so much more to Ireland than to the United Kingdom. The reaction of the Irish Open galleries will doubtless confirm to him the next four days that he has chosen correctly.
McDowell welcomed the news. “I think it’s great that he’s put it to bed at last,” he said. “I’m hoping to be there alongside him. There’s no doubt he’ll be there. It’s a very difficult decision, because if you want to get religious or political about it, declaring for one or the other, you’re going to upset someone theoretically.
“I was kind of glad that I had the opportunity to play the World Cup last year and put it to bed personally for me. There’s been absolutely no negative reaction and I don’t expect there to be any [to McIlroy]. Anybody that wants to have a problem with it is looking at it too hard.”
