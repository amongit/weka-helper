Thierry Henry has said he doubted Liverpool Jordan Henderson had what it took to play at the highest level, but he has been proved wrong.
Henry praised Henderson's work ethic and said that he reminds him of his former France team-mate Lilian Thuram, who became his country's most capped player despite not being "the most gifted".
Ahead of Liverpool's game against Manchester United on Sunday, Henry said that though Steven Gerrard would be hugely missed when he leaves Anfiled, Henderson is a "true leader".

"There were times when I thought Jordan Hendeson was not a 'Liverpool' player and would not become the midfielder he was hoping to be," Henry wrote in his column in the Sun on Sunday.
"I don't think I'm alone in saying this. I did have some major doubts.
"There was a concern he was not quite good enough to play at the very hightest level, but the transformation in his game has been truly unbelievable.

"He has become an animal in Liverpool's midfield, I mean in a good way.
"He wants to work. He wants to deliver for his team. He wants to score goals., He wants to become the player he dreamed of."
