Rugby union has probably never had a day like this, with three successively magnificently matches, and Twickenham has probably never seen a match quite like this.
It defied every logic. It was mesmerizing, it was compelling, it was mad and it was exhausting just to watch.

But the upshot was that England, despite scoring a remarkable seven tries, did not acquire a high enough points difference to overcome Ireland at the top of the RBS Six Nations table.

It will have been of little consolation that their 20-point advantage over France put them ahead of Wales in second place, the fourth time in four years they have finished there.
But they should not feel any regret. They gave it everything in a display that was quite spell-binding in its ambition, even if it was also chaotic at times.

To make sense of it afterwards is difficult, and you will not see too many matches like this in the Rugby World Cup, but of one thing you can be certain; Ben Youngs has never had a better game for England. The scrum half was extraordinarily good, scoring two tries and threatening at almost every opportunity.
Centre Jonathan Joseph had another remarkable match, as did No 8 Billy Vunipola, while George Ford did many good things, scoring 25 points including a try, unfortunately amid some bad things too, but James Haskell was stupidly yellow-carded in the second half in a moment of madness that was costly as France scored two tries while he was absent.
But the better news for the wider game was that at last France came to play here. This was by some considerable distance their best performance of the tournament, and their best for some time overall. They played with width and verve. They added hugely to the spectacle, and scored five tries of their own.
England’s task had been to win by 26 points in order to equal Ireland’s points difference of +63, with their try tally- the next point of differentiation- already superior.
Flagging: England show their colour
It was a big ask, but one made so much easier when England scored in the second minute of the match. A French scrummage was disrupted and fly half Jules Plisson threw a wild pass that Joseph collected in midfield. The space was vast and Joseph duly found Mike Brown on the outside. Ford was in support and found his scrum half Youngs inside for a sensational score. Ford converted.
Score: The impressive Ben Youngs opens the scoring
Ruck ball in France’s half was slow and then untidy so that Youngs panicked and tried to find Courtney Lawes, England’s only player on the right-hand side of the field. The ball went loose and scrum half Sebastien Tillous-Borde picked up and unsurprisingly outpace Dan Cole to score.
The last time England had beaten France by such a margin had been in a Rugby World Cup warm-up match in 2003 when they won by 31; the last time in a Six Nations match being in 2001 when they won at Twickenham by 29.
Hitting back: Sebastien Tillous-Borde beats James Haskell of England to score
It was soon 15-7 after Noa Nakaitaci scored a controversial try resulting from James Haskell turning the ball over in the tackle. It really should have been a simple score for the winger but in his desire to get round under the posts he very nearly butchered the chance as Youngs made a despairing tackle.
Was his foot out of play before he touched the ball down? Did he indeed have control of the ball as he touched down? Those were the two key questions. Both were highly debatable. But both came back in France’s favour. Plisson converted. It was 15-7.


Nakaitaci should have scored again and Plisson should have kicked another penalty, but they did not. And Lawes could have been sin-binned for a tackle on Plisson, but he was not.
Ford kicked a penalty and then England scored a wonderful try from Anthony Watson. Cole made the stunning turnover, Youngs broke and found Ford. The ball went loose but not forward from an English hand, going from Joseph to Haskell to Watson. Ford converted. England led 17-15.
It was then 24-15 when Youngs scored again, thanks to a wondrous break from his own line by Joseph before kicking ahead and winning a penalty. Brown tapped and Youngs sniped. Ford converted and then added a penalty on the stroke of the break. It was 27-15 after an extraordinary, breathless half.
Double: Ben Youngs dives over for his second try of the game
England needed a good start to the second half but Ford kicked straight out and France capitalised, scoring a superb try from Guilhem Guirado’s back-of-the-hand pass to Maxime Mermoz. Plisson converted.
Back came England as the astoundingly good Youngs made a break to put Ford under the posts. Ford converted. England were ahead by 12 again.
Rory Kockott kicked a penalty but Jack Nowell then scored England’s fifth try, showing good footwork on the left, after Scott Spedding had been sliced down by Lawes under his posts. Ford converted. It was 41-25. England were 16 ahead.

But then Haskell was yellow-carded for a silly trip on Plisson. And England paid for it as Nakaitaci escaped down the left and fed the supporting Vincent Debaty to score. Some try from a prop.
England made changes with Danny Cipriani replacing Watson and Brown moving to the wing, and although Tom Youngs lost his first line out, Billy Vunipola barged over and Ford converted. England were 18 ahead.
Guess what? France scored again, with Haskell still off, as replacement Benjamin Kayser went over from a driving line out.
But England were not done. Nowell scored his second from a pass from Ford and Ford converted. England were 20 ahead with just under five minutes remaining.
Agony: England look dejected at the final whistle
With just over a minute remaining England had a line out on France’s line but could not score, and even when awarded a penalty France crazily tried to run it at first. Eventually they cleared and it was over.
As were England’s championship hopes for another year. Close but no cigar again. But it had been a classic.
