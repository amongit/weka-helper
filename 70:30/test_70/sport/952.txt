The sixth and final round of the Revolution Series returns to the National Cycling Centre in Manchester on Saturday with a special programme of events that includes an attempt at the men's hour record.
I'll be back in the hotseat with updates from Gustav Larsson's UCI hour record ride (from around 2.45pm) before returning for the concluding session of this year's Revolution Series from 6.30pm.

Earlier this week orgainsers announced that Gustav Larsson would become the latest rider to make an attempt at blue riband event of endurance track cycling. The Swede will tackle Rohan Dennis's mark of 52.491km at the Manchester Velodrome as the concluding event of the afternoon session.
Despite being a late addition to the programme and having broken his back last year, the Cult Energy rider is confident but fully aware of the challenge the hour-long test poses.
“I am very confident of breaking the Swedish hour record but it is the world record I am after” he said in a statement. “I think it will be possible – it will not be easy but I am feeling ready for the challenge.”
“I was inspired to try for the hour record when I was trying to heal my broken back last year. It was one of the goals to get back on the bike and to look forward to through the rehab and winter training.”
“When I heard about the [aborted Alex] Dowsett and [Dame Sarah] Storey attempts at the Revolution Series meet at London I thought it was a super concept. It looked like the perfect venue to do my attempt at the last round and on the historically fast track in Manchester so we contacted the organisers”.
After hosting Dame Sarah Storey's failed attempt at the women's hour last month, promoter James Pope is now ready to host the first men's endeavour the Revolution Series after Dowsett's planned endeavour was cancelled after the Movistar rider suffered a broken collarbone during training.
“We're pleased to be hosting another UCI hour record attempt in the UK and look forward to welcoming Gustav to Manchester,” said Pope.
“The atmosphere and excitement we experienced during Dame Sarah Storey's attempt was phenomenal so we know the event will make a great addition to the Revolution race programme.”
