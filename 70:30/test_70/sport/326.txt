Four sports starved of Rio Olympics funds by UK Sport ask, what about our legacy?

Basketball, handball, wrestling and table tennis will all receive no funding between now and the Olympics in Rio in 2016. Indoor volleyball has also been cut adrift, although the British women’s beach volleyball team will receive support.
UK Sport, the body which awards funding for elite athletes, has pledged a total of £347 million to Britain’s Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls between now and the Rio Games. They have set them the challenge of winning even more medals than they managed in London, something no host nation has achieved before.
But where all sports were given financial backing before this summer’s Olympics, UK Sport has adopted a far more ruthless approach this time around.
Sports minister Hugh Robertson admitted on Tuesday that the sports which had had their funding cut off were only supported before London because organisers thought it would help them sell tickets.
Robertson said: “When we hosted the Olympics we supported all sports, mainly to drive ticket sales, although it turned out that that wasn’t a huge problem. But going forward it is done on a performance basis and there is not a lot of point of funding a few sports which will not be there in medal contention.”

The cut in basketball funding was most savage, falling from £8.6million to nothing and promoting a furious reaction from British Basketball’s performance chairman, Roger Moreland.
“We knew the criteria that UK Sport were applying for Rio, but having been funded to the tune of £8.6million in the lead up to the London Olympics because of the sport’s medal potential for the future, this is a devastating decision and is a waste of that investment,” he said.
“Over the last five years, the GB teams have done the equivalent of going from League Two in football to the Premier League.
"They have been competing with the very best countries in the world. It doesn’t seem much of a legacy from 2012 to dash the hopes and aspirations of a sport whose heartland is founded in Britain’s inner cities.”
The decision not to award funding to volleyball, other than the beach version, means there will be no support for sitting volleyball, the Paralympic sport at which 7/7 bombings survivor Martine Wright competed for Britain.
Volleyball England’s chief executive Lisa Wainwright said UK Sport had made a mockery of the concept of an Olympic legacy.
She said: “The investment requested from UK Sport was less than £500,000 per year per squad over the next four years. Everyone will have seen the impact sitting volleyball can have on people with the winner of the BBC’s Helen Rollason Award, Martine Wright. When we speak of legacy remember this day, the flame has well and truly been extinguished.”
In general, Paralympic sports were winners in Tuesday’s announcement with funding levels increasing by 43 per cent, while 19 Olympic sports were given greater sums in funding than before London.
Cycling’s success at the Games reflected in them being awarded the biggest grant but swimming, which with three medals fell short of its London 2012 target, was cut by nearly £4 million.
“This is not about punishment [of the swimmers],” said UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl, but swimming is now considering whether it will close up to three of its five elite training centres, although a final decision will not be taken until a new performance director is appointed.
The funding, of which two-thirds come from the National Lottery and the final third from the taxpayer, also gave a major boost to boxing, whose increase of £4.3million was in percentage terms the biggest of any sport. But it came accompanied by a warning that boxing’s governing body in England must iron out disputes with counterparts in Scotland and Wales or risk losing the money.
Nicholl said the ambition of winning 66 medals in the Olympics and 121 in the Paralympics in Rio – exceeding the totals in London – was an “incredible challenge” but Robertson added: “There are very few sports where we see a reason for a huge fall off and quite a few sports which can do better.
"Australia’s funding fell off a cliff and that is the first mistake we haven’t made, we are making sure there is more money available to be the first home country to improve performance at the next Games.”
Some of the sports which did worst out of Tuesday’s announcement were awarded far higher levels on funding by Sport England on Monday. Sport England funds grassroots while UK Sport is solely concerned with top level sport.
“There has been a real effort to align the two strategies,” Robertson said.
Baroness Sue Campbell, Chair of UK Sport, added: “It is not about being popular, it is about making tough decisions.”
