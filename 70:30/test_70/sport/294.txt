The brother of Albania’s Prime Minister was arrested in Belgrade on Tuesday night, accused of starting the trouble that caused the abandonment of the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania.
Serbian state television RTS reported cited the Serbian Interior Ministry to say that Olsi Rama controlled a drone from his seat in an executive box in the stadium, carrying a ‘Greater Albania’ flag which flew over the pitch, triggering clashes between the teams as some of the 20,000 home fans tried to assault Albanian players.

But Rama, who later returned to Tirana with the Albanian team to a hero's welcome, said he had "nothing to do with the drone".
"I don't understand where this story came from," he said. "I was neither arrested nor detained. When the incident occurred the situation became chaotic, police were checking everyone.

Why Serbia v Albania had to be abandoned
"I showed them my US passport and my camera and all this lasted only a few minutes."
The incident, in the 41st minute of the Group I encounter at which Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic was also in attendance, led to its abandonment by English referee Martin Atkinson with the score goalless.
Serbian fans hurled smoke bombs and other missiles onto the pitch in protest in a game from which Albanian fans had been barred by the Serbian federation on Sunday.
This incident comes just days before the highly sensitive visit of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, the first such visit in 68 years.
The Albanian Interior Ministry said they had been watching the events unfold anxiously and had been in contact with the staff of their counterparts in Belgrade to transmit a message from their Interior Minister Saimir Tahiri.
“The Serbian Government is responsible for the security, the life and health of the footballers and the Albanian delegation,” he said in his message.

Relations between Tirana and Belgrade have been fragile over Kosovo, a former Serbian province, and the ethnic Albanian minority in southern Serbia, who often demand more autonomy.
Some in Belgrade see Tirana’s interest as part of a plan aimed at creating a ‘Greater Albania’ that would unite Albanian communities in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia and southern Serbia. Kosovo’s independence has been recognised by more than 100 countries, including the United States and most EU member states. Kosovo, the former Serbian province comprised mainly of Albanians, proclaimed its unilateral independence in February 2008.

The premature and violent end to the game was greeted with joy by nearly 5,000 Kosovar Albanians gathered to watch it in their capital Pristina, shouting ‘Greater Albania’ and ‘victory’.
“What happened is something we can’t comprehend at the moment,” Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic, the Serbia captain, said. “All I can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the Albanian players every step of the way to the tunnel.
"In the name of my team I can say that we wanted to continue the match ... but the Albanian players said they weren't in the physical or psychological state to continue."
European football's governing body Uefa said the circumstances of the match would be reported to its Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body.

Kosovo's formation was made possible by a bloody chain of events after the end of the Soviet era.
The demise of the Soviet Union in 1990-91 created the conditions for the bloody wars that broke Yugoslavia apart into six multi-ethnic states, including Serbia.
Nato carried out a 78-day bombing campaign which led to Serb troops pulling out of Kosovo in 1999 and brought an end to the Serbian government's repression of the ethnic Albanian population.
Serbia says the Nato airstrikes killed 2,500 civilians, including 89 children, a figure contested by Nato.
