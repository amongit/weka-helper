Austin Rivers To Hornets With No. 10 Pick In 2012 NBA Draft
NEW ORLEANS (AP) â€” The New Orleans Hornets have taken Austin Rivers with the 10th overall pick in Thursday night's NBA draft.

Rivers, the son of Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, averaged a team-high 15.5 points per game as a freshman at Duke.

The 6-foot-4 guard was among 27 players the Hornets worked out at their suburban training center, and coach Monty Williams has said he was hoping the club would add a guard or wing player who can create his own shot.

Rivers scored in double-figures 30 times last season, hitting the 20-point mark eight times.

He also averaged 3.4 rebounds, while finishing second on the team in assists with 71 and steals with 33.

Rivers joins top overall pick Anthony Davis in the Hornets' 2012 draft class.
