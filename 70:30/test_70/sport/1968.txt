Sunday Roundup
This week, the NBA Finals came down to a breath-taking final game, with LeBron and the Heat ultimately repeating as champs -- while, in DC, the Supreme Court pushed its ruling on gay marriage to the SCOTUS equivalent of a Game 7 (here's hoping legal superstars David Boies and Ted Olson take home the MVP trophy). As we also wait for the High Court's ruling on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a different ghost of the pre-civil rights South reared its ugly head, with Paula Deen losing her job for using "the N-word" and planning a "plantation-style" wedding for her brother. Meanwhile, the name for Kim and Kanye's baby is no longer pending. Some questioned their parenting compass after they went with a compass pun, but at least they didn't go with "Yeezus."
