World No 1 Serena Williams has slammed Shamil Tarpishchev for using "extremely sexist, racist and bullying" comments, after the Russian Tennis Federation president described her and sister Venus as the "Williams brothers".
The WTA took swift action and fined Tarpishchev $25,000 and disqualified him from working in an organisational capacity for a year after he made the comments on Russian State Television on Friday.
Tarpishchev, who is also an International Olympic Committee member, made an official apology later on Saturday, after a WTA demand to do so, but that was not enough for a clearly unhappy Williams.
"I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time. I thought they were in a way bullying," Williams said.
"I've done the best that I can do, and that's all I can say. So I just wasn't very happy with his comments. I think a lot of people weren't happy as well.

"But the WTA and the USTA (United States Tennis Association) did a wonderful job of making sure that - in this day and age, 2014, for someone with his power, it's really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks."
Appearing on a chat show alongside former Olympic singles champion Elena Dementieva, the programme host said to Tarpishchev: "I was at the Olympics, where Maria Sharapova was in the final, playing with one, with one of the...." before the RTF head responded by saying "Williams brothers". He also said the sisters were "scary" to look at.
Asked whether he regretted his comments, Tarpischev initially insisted that the program on which he spoke was "a humorous show," adding: "I don't answer stupid questions." When asked about his ban, Tarpischev said: "I can't comment. I don't understand it."
However, in a statement released later by the Russian Tennis Federation, Tarpischev denied any "malicious intent" and said his quotes had been taken out of context. "I didn't want to offend any athlete with my words," he said. "I regret that this joke ... has garnered so much attention."
The WTA said it would seek his removal as chairman of the Kremlin Cup tournament, which ends on Sunday. Tarpischev has been chairman of the Kremlin Cup, Russia's only WTA event, for all of its 18 years as part of the women's tour, and is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. During the 1990s, he was the personal tennis coach to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and served as his adviser on sports matters.
Serena, meanwhile, is the current world No 1 and has won 18 grand slam singles titles. She has also teamed up with her elder sister Venus to win 13 grand slams and three Olympic gold medals in doubles.
Venus, 34, is a former world No 1, who has won seven grand slam singles titles.
Serena is currently in Singapore to play in the season-ending WTA Finals tournament, which she has won for the past two years. The tournament begins on Monday.
