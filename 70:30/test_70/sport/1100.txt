Graeme McDowell says he will feel like the referee in the France v Germany World Cup quarter-final when he partners Victor Dubuisson and Martin Kaymer in the first two rounds at Le Golf National.
Except, it is the Northern Irishman who really needs to win to progress to his sport’s most coveted arena.
Dubuisson and Kaymer are already assured of their berths at the Ryder Cup in September, but down in 17th place in the standings McDowell knows time is running out if he is force his way on to Paul McGinley’s team.
“It’s clear some good players are going to miss out and I’m acutely aware it could be me,” McDowell said.
“That’s why you just have to focus on your game and let the Ryder Cup come in a run of good form.”

How he could do with a repeat of last year’s victory at the Alstom Open de France and join the likes of JH Taylor, Bobby Locke, Sir Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros who have successfully defended at the 108-year-old event.
And although he has yet to record a top five in 11 strokeplay events thus far this season, McDowell finished sixth at the Irish Open two weeks ago and seemed to be peaking at the right time.
For the 34-year-old, this would be exactly what he has been aiming for, having reduced his early season schedule. “I’m feeling good and ready for an exciting summer,” he said. “I’ve really made a decision this year to pace myself and get myself in prime condition come July, August, September.
“I felt like the last three or four years, come August, I’ve been pretty tired. I haven’t been mentally and physically ready for the FedEx play-offs and into the early part of the autumn with the Ryder Cup.”
Kaymer is the obvious danger, particularly as he does not have the distractions in Versailles that he encountered in last week’s BMW International Open in Cologne on his homecoming following his US Open triumph. A past winner, Kaymer has already claimed one small victory.
“When I saw the tee-times, 1.20pm in the first round and then early on Friday, I was very glad,” Kaymer said. “I like to think that the organisers did it on purpose so I could watch the World Cup quarter-finals.”
