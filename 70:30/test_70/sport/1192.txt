Patrick Vieira is facing an uncertain future at Manchester City and could leave the Etihad Stadium this summer with the club’s hierarchy yet to offer the former Arsenal captain the chance to extend his current contract, which expires at the end of the season.
Vieira, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, had been regarded as a potential future manager of the club after being appointed as head coach of City’s Elite Development Squad in May 2013.
But despite the 38-year-old having just three months left to run on his contract with the Premier League champions, no talks have taken place over a new deal, with none currently planned.
Vieira is highly-regarded by chief executive Ferran Soriano and City’s Abu Dhabi owners and, having spent the last three years securing his coaching qualifications, is close to completing his training in order to become a manager or head coach at first-team level.
Despite reports in Germany linking Vieira with a move to Bayern Munich to replace Erik ten Hag as the club’s second-team manager, it is understood that no contact has been made beyond Vieira spending four-days at Bayern’s Sabener Strasse training ground last month to undertake a four-day placement as part of a case study towards earning his coaching qualifications.
Munich has been suggested as a possible destination for Vieira
Vieira has made no secret of his ambitions to become a manager and, with his contract up at City this summer, regards the coming months as a crucial stage in his career.
His time in charge of the Elite Development Squad has been regarded as a success, with City’s youngsters reaching the quarter-finals of the Uefa Youth League for a second successive season this year – City were eliminated from the competition following a 2-1 defeat against AS Roma on Tuesday.
However, with Vieira now close to being qualified to manage at first-team level, uncertainty surrounding the future of City manager Manuel Pellegrini could also force the club to make a firm decision on Vieira’s position beyond the end of this campaign.
