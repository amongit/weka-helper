Amir Khan can be a huge star - Sugar Ray Leonard
Coverage: Live on pay-per-view Primetime TV, commentary on BBC 5 live & BBC Sport website, plus full fight report and reaction
Boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard admits he is impressed with British boxer Amir Khan and believes the 24-year-old has a chance to "make a name for himself" in his unification bout against Zab Judah.
Khan will be defending his WBA light-welterweight crown in Las Vegas against IBF title-holder Judah in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Leonard adds that Khan should not be thinking about future fights against the likes of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao and should instead concentrate on the Judah bout.
