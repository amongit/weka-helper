Canberra Raiders prop David Shillington is unlikely to join Hull KR, according to coach Chris Chester.
The Robins are looking to replace Mick Weyman, who was forced to retire with a knee injury last week.
Shillington, 31, has been linked with a move to the Super League side.
"He's a player that's out of contract at the end of the year but I would think his wage demands would put him out of our league," Chester told BBC Radio Humberside.
"He's a name that has been put forward to us along with another 20 or 30.
"It would be fantastic. He's played State of Origin, he's a big, strong kid and he knows Terry Campese well but it's all just speculation."
The Robins are currently eighth in Super League with two wins from their first five matches.
