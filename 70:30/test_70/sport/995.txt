Needing to finish fourth or better to confirm the closest finish in the race's history - never before had the winner still been unknown with two legs remaining - Cammas's Groupama 4 boat finished second in the ninth and final leg, a short 550-mile sprint from Lorient in France.

The result gave Cammas an unassailable 24-point lead over Camper with just the Galway in-port race to complete on Saturday.
"This is an incredible moment for me," said Cammas, who follows 1985-86 winner Lionel Pean as the only French winner of the 39-year-old offshore event.
"It was always my dream just to participate in this race. The first book I ever read was about this race and it hasn't sunk in yet."

It was the first time that France had competed in the race for 18 years and Cammas was considered a big outsider despite a big reputation in his home country as a single-handed and team sailor.
Cammas had looked an unlikely winner at the start of the 39,270-nautical mile marathon after making a poor navigation choice in the first leg from Spain to South Africa and finishing well off the pace set by Spanish boat Telefonica, who won the first three legs.
But Cammas clawed back the early advantage by the seventh of nine legs - at one point they were nearly 30 points behind Telefonica - to leave the consistent French outfit as favourites to win overall.

"The race started badly for us but every single member of the team raised their level and that's what saw us home," Cammas said.
Abu Dhabi Racing, skippered by Britain's Ian Walker, finished fifth on leg nine and the same overall. Walker, though, will be hoping for a fourth in-port win at the weekend.
Standings after the final offshore leg:
1. Groupama (France) 250 points 2. Camper/ETNZ (Spain/New Zealand) 226 3. Pima (US) 220 4. Telefonica (Spain) 209 5. Abu Dhabi (UAE) 124 + 5 or 10 6. Sanya (China) 40 + 5 or 10
