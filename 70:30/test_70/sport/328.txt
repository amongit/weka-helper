America could finally have a team on the Formula One grid as NASCAR team owner Gene Haas has declared his interest in entering a marque.
Early last month motor sport's world governing body, the FIA, said it was seeking new entrants for F1, to run as early as next season.
Haas, one half of the successful Stewart-Haas Racing team based in Kannapolis, North Carolina, has officially made clear his position.
A statement read: "We have responded to the FIA's call for expression of interest regarding a Formula One entry on behalf of Haas Racing Development.
"We respect the FIA's evaluation process and will share more details in the coming weeks."

Full applications are required to be submitted by Feb 10, with the FIA to make a decision 18 days later.
Haas certainly has the credentials and capability to get a new team up and running, notably as he owns factory facilities in Brussels which would likely be key for a European base.
Haas also runs the full-scale Windshear rolling-road wind tunnel in North Carolina that has previously been used by a number of Formula One teams.
Former Red Bull and Jaguar technical director Guenther Steiner is known to be working with Haas on the project.
America last tried to get a team on the grid in 2010 at a time when F1 was seeking significant expansion, only for US F1's plans to fail to come to fruition.
