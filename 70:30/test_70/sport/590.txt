Cautious Hodgson
The manager does not want England to be the new Liverpool. They lined up 4-3-3, with Rooney in the Suárez role and Wilshere for Coutinho but this was, dispiritingly, not an attempt to replicate Brendan Rodgers’ tactics. Instead England morphed in a 4-3-2-1, such is Hodgson’s natural caution.
Too fluid up front
Daniel Sturridge, the in-form striker, ended up largely on the wing. He was put through the middle on occasions but needed more time at centre-forward. He looked worryingly dispirited given the importance of the occasion. It was a waste of time putting Raheem Sterling in the central role.

If there was any doubt that Adam Lallana should be in the World Cup squad then it was dispelled by his confident cameo role – capped by the fine piece of skill to create Daniel Sturridge’s goal. He made a compelling case to be in the starting line-up ahead of Jack Wilshere, who struggled again.
Wrong opponents
Choosing Denmark was curious given England’s World Cup group opponents and their contrasting style of play. The limited, depleted Danes were strangely combative – with the odd kick and trip and wild tackle. Even so they still caused England problems, which was a worry.
Sterling work
Raheem Sterling has booked his World Cup place: England lacked pace and tempo, but the teenager provided impetus with his energy, speed and ability to pick a pass – as he did in releasing Rooney. He was dangerous throughout and, at the very least, will be regarded by Hodgson as a useful impact player.
