Rams owner's NFL stadium proposal for LA would house 2 teams
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An NFL team owner has designed a Los Angeles-area stadium for two clubs - with two home locker rooms, identical sets of office space and two owners' suites.
The Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1bluJSd ) says St. Louis Rams' owner Stan Kroenke doesn't need to partner with another NFL team to finance the $1.86-billion venue in Inglewood but that the league wants a stadium for two teams.
His plan competes with one by the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders, who want to share a stadium in Carson.
Details of the Kroenke stadium's design are being revealed as league owners prepare to gather Monday in Phoenix.
Kroenke hasn't said he plans to move the Rams, but analysts doubt he would invest in a stadium and not use it for his team.
