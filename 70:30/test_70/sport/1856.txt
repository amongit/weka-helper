Ivan Ukhov Wins Gold In Olympic High Jump, Erik Kynard Takes Silver Wearing USA Socks (PHOTOS)
LONDON -- Ivan Ukhov of Russia won the high jump in cold conditions and a light drizzle at the London Olympics on Tuesday.
Ukhov, who earned a "strong warning" from the IAAF for being drunk during a competition in 2008, cleared 2.38 meters on his first attempt.
He had one failed attempt at 2.40, an Olympic record, before putting his warm clothes back on and starting the celebrations.
The 2010 world indoor champion was the leading performer in 2012 and held his nerve as Erik Kynard, the 21-year-old American from Toledo, Ohio, raised the height late in the competition to try to get ahead of him.
Kynard took silver at 2.33 meters.
Three men were tied for bronze: Essa Mutaz Barshim of Qatar, Robert Grabaarz of Britain and Derek Drouin of Canada.
