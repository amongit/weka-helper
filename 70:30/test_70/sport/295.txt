Serbia v Albania match abandoned following brawl: In pictures
A Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania was abandoned on Tuesday night after skirmishes broke out among players and fans on the pitch in Belgrade.
The clashes took place after a Serbian team member pulled down an Albanian banner that was suspended from a drone flying over the Partizan Stadium.
The drone, clearly visible in the lights of the stadium, made a series of passes above the pitch.
The banner displayed an Albanian flag and a map of so-called "Greater Albania," an area that comprises territory within today's Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and northern Greece.

English referee Martin Atkinson stopped the match in the 41st minute when Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic managed to grab the banner and Albania players tried to protect it.
Several Serbian fans invaded the pitch and clashed with Albania players.
The Group I match was later abandoned "due to a disturbance on the pitch," according to Uefa, with the score at 0-0.
Serbian team captain, Branislav Ivanovic, said that he and his players wanted to continue the match but the Albanian players decided they were "not physically and mentally" able to carry on.
Albanian fans had been warned against attending the game between the two Balkan rival nations that have had turbulent relations - mainly over the Albanian-dominated former Serbian province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008.
