Between the second and third sets, while Novak Djokovic and Fernando Verdasco were sitting in their chairs taking on fluids, both men became aware of a loud cheer rippling around the Rod Laver Arena.
Up in the gods, a man in a pale pink shirt had just proposed to his girlfriend. And she had said yes. As the man punched the air in triumph and soaked up the applause of the crowd – Australians, eh? – Djokovic momentarily broke character, getting to his feet and joining in the applause.
“Beautiful,” he said afterwards. “A very important moment for him and for her. It’s one of these moments you remember forever. Not just for them, but for everybody who was there. They’re going to spend their life together, so I wish them all the best.”
It was a strangely poignant moment. Over the course of accumulating his four Australian Open titles, Djokovic has asserted a certain spiritual ownership of this court. Just like Roger Federer on Centre Court and Rafael Nadal on Philippe Chatrier, Djokovic has made the Rod Laver Arena his pulpit, the crowd his congregation. Now, before those here present, he was giving this impromptu union his blessing. Benedictions thus dispensed, he then resumed his ass-beating of Verdasco, which he eventually concluded in straight sets, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Not that it was easy, by any stretch. Djokovic was tested as he had yet to be tested before in this tournament. Verdasco, the Spanish No31 seed with the heart of a matador and a forehand like a left hook, threw everything he had at Djokovic for two hours and 21 minutes.

He might even have stolen the first set, had he not fluffed a crucial second serve when 5-3 up in the tie-break. But ultimately, inevitably, Djokovic weathered the dust-storm, recording his highest ever first-serve percentage at the Australian Open – 73 per cent.
You never hear all that much about Djokovic’s serve. The return, sure. The incredible rubber-limbed baseline hustle, sure. Even his gluten intake is deemed more worthy of comment. But the sheer accuracy of his delivery, along with the venomous kick he finds with his second serve, is one of the primary weapons in a game devoid of significant weakness. Here he took a little pace off his serve and went for the corners. Verdasco, a pretty handy server himself, had no answers.
And yet had Verdasco managed to hold his nerve at the crucial moment, the outcome might have been quite different. He had managed to frustrate Djokovic in that first set, saving six break points and edging ahead in the tie-break. At 5-3, with a second serve, he tossed the ball just a little higher behind his head, striving for a smidgen of extra topspin. Too much. Verdasco caught the ball with the frame of his racquet, the ball bouncing before it had even reached the net. Under the utmost pressure, Verdasco’s technique had broken.
Djokovic cleaned up the tie-break 10-8, and Verdasco never got as close again. Though the crowd, demanding a contest, began to rally around him in the second set, he was broken early in that set. In the third set, a long percussive groundstroke rally ended with Verdasco slicing a backhand into the net and Djokovic breaking for a 3-2 lead, which he served out for the match.
Afterwards, while being interviewed by Jim Courier, Djokovic took the microphone. It was his mother’s birthday, and as the crowd joined in a chorus of Happy Birthday to Dijana Djokovic, the affection in the arena was palpable. Djokovic’s parents, his wife, and his baby son Stefan were all on the other side of the world. But here, amongst his second family, on his favourite court, he could almost convince himself he was at home. It was a night when you could feel the love, and in more ways than one.
