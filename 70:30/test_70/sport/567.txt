Roy Hodgson believes that Jack Wilshere is coming of age as an international force, providing another positive for the manager at the end of what he concedes has been a “tough year” for England given the World Cup embarrassment.
“All he needs to add to his game to be totally outstanding is goals,’’ Hodgson said of the midfielder.
Hodgson gambled on fielding Wilshere at the base of the diamond against Switzerland in England’s most difficult Euro 2016 qualifier in Basel and was rewarded with an increasingly strong display. Wilshere has since played well for Hodgson, particularly in the 3-1 friendly win against Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday.
Wilshere earned plenty of praise in Glasgow with the Daily Record hailing him as “a class act” and rating him nine out of 10, the top mark of all involved. “An intelligent and probing presence at the hub of England’s midfield,’’ was The Scotsman’s verdict.
England’s coaching staff had been keen to see how Wilshere would handle little space and intense pressure as applied occasionally by Scotland and particularly Steven Naismith. The 22-year-old coped admirably, withstanding challenges and creating the first goal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with a pinpoint delivery.

“Jack’s been excellent,’’ Hodgson said. “He’s still young. He can still play for the Under-21s. When he burst on the scene, a very bright future was predicted for him but then he got injured. In my first year and a half with the team, we were always saying ‘what a pity we don’t have Jack Wilshere, wouldn’t it be nice if Jack was fit’. It’s been only since the lead-up to the World Cup and afterwards that I’ve had this period with him where I can always count on him being there.
“Right from the start we could see what he could do. Players are special who can do what he does with the ball, ie take responsibility in receiving balls from the back, even under pressure, the ability to turn with the ball, the ability to see a pass. All he needs to add to his game to be totally outstanding is goals. I thought he got one [against Scotland] but he managed to hook it wide like one of my golf shots.”
England will get more heightened tests when they face friendlies against France on Nov 17 at Wembley next year and Germany away in March 2016. The FA is also talking to Holland and Spain about friendlies for Hodgson’s men before Euro 2016.
Nathaniel Clyne also impressed Hodgson, the right-back building on a strong debut against Slovenia last Saturday at Wembley. “I certainly think if there was a game in a week or two’s time he would be one of the first names on the team-sheet. Unfortunately March is a long time away, but Nathaniel has shown what he can do. He deservedly got a lot of praise on Saturday and I would like to think he’d get a lot of praise again for his performance against Scotland.
“What he’s got to do is make sure he keeps on playing well for Southampton. If I was picking my squad for March now, he is in it. He has done well, let’s hope he keeps his feet on the ground and keeps on improving and hopefully he’ll understand more and more what we’ve been trying to do in terms of our team play the longer he is with us.”
It has been a positive end to a year filled with a summer of negatives. Clyne has come through, probably curtailing the international career of Glen Johnson. Wilshere has seemed more robust in matches, and more able to impose his undoubted technical expertise. Luke Shaw and Fraser Forster confirmed their promise in Glasgow. Wayne Rooney moved to within four goals of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goalscoring record of 49.
“It’s nice,’’ Hodgson said. “It’s been a tough year. I thought going into the World Cup we were looking in reasonable shape and there was a lot of optimism. I didn’t think we were doing that badly and, of course, the World Cup came along and we failed like we did and it knocks you for six. I’m pleased the team have been able to get the ship back on an even keel. There is a lot to expect from them because there are some good athletes and some good technical players.
“They have been asked to step up to the plate and we’ve even found a few more along the way. Like Fabian Delph, who came into the squad and up until he got injured looked comfortable there and Nathaniel Clyne, who has come into the squad and looked very comfortable there.
“On top of that we have got Danny Welbeck, Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and all these guys who’ve played bit parts but who we think in our work going forward instead of playing bit parts they have got to show they are bona-fide good-quality international England players.”
Hodgson will take Christmas off but will otherwise continue attending games and assessing players. Charlie Austin at Queens Park Rangers is one under consideration. He has still to field Saido Berahino despite picking him for the latest squad. Ryan Bertrand’s performances at Southampton will be followed. “We will be looking at everyone,’’ Hodgson said.
“Anyone who’s doing well for his club team we watch, we even keep an eye on players in the Championship. But I’d like to think it is going to get harder and harder to break into an England squad because there are plenty of people in there who’ve got their hands on the shirt and are pretty determined not to let it go.”
Hodgson has enthused regularly about Ross Barkley, yet used him only sparingly, partially because the Evertonian, 20, has been returning from injury and also because of a lingering concern over the player occasionally giving the ball away. “I’m not uncertain about him. Barkley has only just come back from a long injury. He’s an outstanding talent and part of our thoughts going forward.
“But at this particular point in time, I think that he, like Theo [Walcott], needs a few more games to help him. I’ve no doubt that will happen and that in future he will give us another interesting option in terms of team formation. He is capable of playing in that position behind the front players, like Raheem is, and causing enormous problems for the opposition. We like him very much.”
