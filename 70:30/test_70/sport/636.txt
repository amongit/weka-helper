Jonathan Trott will return to the England squad for the first time since leaving the Ashes tour in November 2013 when he is named in the party to tour the West Indies on Wednesday.
Trott has convinced the England management that he has recovered from his stress-related condition and he has been rewarded for scoring heavily on the England Lions tour to South Africa this year.
He is expected to open the batting in the West Indies as England continue to search for a replacement to Andrew Strauss as Alastair Cook’s opening partner.

England are due to play three Tests in the West Indies, starting in Antigua on April 13, and the tour is a crucial part of their preparation for the Ashes next summer.
Trott, 33, has opened just once for England in Test cricket but he will take any opportunity to restart his international career and earn a chance to play Australia in order to gain some kind of closure on what happened on the last Ashes tour.
Adil Rashid, Yorkshire’s 27-year-old leg-spinner, is also poised to go to the West Indies, and with injury concerns over Moeen Ali there could also be a call-up for James Tredwell as cover. Moeen has a side strain and is expected to be out of action for four weeks, which leaves him little time to find form.

England have been impressed by the progress of Sam Billings, the Kent wicketkeeper-batsman, and are keen for him to gain more exposure, which means he could be picked ahead of Jonny Bairstow as Jos Buttler’s understudy.
Adam Lyth and Sam Robson remain contenders for the squad as batting cover or to open with Cook if it is decided to bat Trott elsewhere or there are any injuries.
The squad was chosen as the England and Wales Cricket Board’s review of the team’s disastrous World Cup began with Tom Harrison, the new chief executive, meeting Paul Downton, the managing director. Harrison’s review will be delivered to the ECB board in the first week of April and will decide the futures of senior members of the England management.

Harrison is understood to have met Downton on Tuesday to seek an explanation for the World Cup performance. Peter Moores, the head coach who is also fighting for his position, will speak to Harrison this week.
Harrison will then meet Colin Graves, the chairman-elect of the ECB, next week before presenting his findings and recommendations to the ECB’s full board. If it is felt that immediate action is needed then an emergency board meeting would be called to make any significant decision that would have an immediate impact on the team.
Downton’s position is under increasing pressure following England’s first-round exit and insiders were disappointed to hear him publicly blame the players rather than admit that mistakes had been made by Moores, the coach he reappointed last year, at the World Cup.

Downton also blamed the culture of one-day cricket in England while loyally sticking by Moores, but the coach made clear mistakes over selection at the World Cup, the team’s inflexibility and lack of adventure as well as by dithering over replacing Cook as captain of the one-day team last year.
Downton will have to present a compelling and convincing case that the England team are heading in the right direction under his and Moores’s management.
There is a growing belief in some quarters that the ECB could learn from the drastic action taken by Cricket Australia in 2013 when it sacked Mickey Arthur as head coach.

Darren Lehmann subsequently regained the Ashes 5-0 with the same captain, Michael Clarke, and largely the same group of players, showing what impact a new management can have in a short space of time.
Moores is seeking to change the perception that his team were blinded by statistics and data, leaving them unable improvise on the field at the World Cup.
The England head coach feels harshly treated by the perception of his methods and will explain to Harrison that the players are provided with statistical data but that there is no pressure on them to read it or use it.
