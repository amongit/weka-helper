The world's greatest bike race got off to a flying start today, as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed the Tour de France to Britain with a spectacular display by the Red Arrows.
The Duke and Duchess were joined by Prince Harry to welcome the world's best cyclists for the "Grand Depart" of the 101st Tour de France.

Cyclists gathered outside the 18th century stately home Harewood House, where they took off their helmets as they were greeted with a rendition of the French and British national anthems, performed by the Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers.
The 198 racers enjoyed clear skies and bright sunshine as they left Leeds town hall at 11am in a leisurely ceremonial start, and began racing in earnest when they departed Harewood House.
