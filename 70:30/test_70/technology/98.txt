The three-day show began with two days of technical training sessions which were followed by a triple-track conference.
Indonesia's winning team named "Rentjong" comprised Rizki Wicaksono, Ammar WK, and Arif Dewantoro. The country's second team, "Belalang Tempur", wasn't ranked on the championship table.
The contest challenged participants' competence in resolving cybersecurity issues ranging from cryptography, exploit, forensic, network analysis, reversing, and steganography. It featured gamified attack-and-defense play.
Laptops, network switches, network cables, additional power sockets were among the items the competing teams--each comprising three members--were expected to bring along for the 16-hour non-stop game over two days. Each team was equipped with gun, firepower, and nuke so they were able protect their daemons as well as defend against attacks by rival teams from other countries and, ultimately, to solve the given challenge.
To destroy their rival's daemon, competitors had to solve bonus challenges by using various ways and without the use of automated scanning tools, ARP spoofing, flooding, and DoS attacks.
