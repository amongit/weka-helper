E-commerce attracts 60 million consumers in Brazil
E-commerce in Brazil achieved a 24 percent rise in 2014 with 61,6 million unique consumers buying online since 2000, according to research.
Out of all consumers that bought something online in the last 15 years, 51,5 million were actively buying online during 2014 and 10,2 million have purchased items over the Internet for the first time. The country currently has a population of 203 million people.
The findings were published in the annual e-commerce trends report Webshoppers, released today (5) by Brazilian consulting firm E-bit.
Despite the current economic instability, Brazilians bought R$347 ($126) on average last year, up 6 percent on the average ticket recorded in 2013.
The consulting firm predicts that by the end of 2015, e-commerce in Brazil will have generated R$43bn ($17bn), an increase of 20 percent in relation to 2014.
Mobile commerce continues to grow steadily, but remains incipient in Brazil - purchases made through smartphones and tablets represent only 9.7 percent of all e-commerce transactions processed in 2014, according to the report.
