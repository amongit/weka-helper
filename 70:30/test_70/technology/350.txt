â€‹Shadow IT in Brazil surpasses world average
IT procured by other non-technology departments in Brazil accounts for 32 percent of all enterprise technology spend versus the world average of 25 percent, according to research.
In addition, 88 percent of IT decision makers in Brazil agree that shadow IT has led to the IT department losing control of their organizations's tech estate, says the study "Art of Connecting: Creativity and the modern CIO" carried out by Vanson Bourne for British Telecom.

The rise in shadow IT has also caused security budgets to increase by 26 percent in Brazil compared to the world average of 20 percent, according to the report.
However, Brazilian chief information officers (CIOs) remain unabated by these changes: 92 percent of the Brazilian IT leaders polled welcome the possibility of becoming IT advisors rather than being exclusive IT managers and being able to think more creatively, compared to the global average of 64 percent.
In terms of technologies that could help unleash the CIO creativity to generate business benefits, Brazilian CIOs see mobility as the main area to focus (79 percent versus 73 percent globally), followed by cloud (73 percent versus 71 percent globally), unified communications (72 percent versus 71 percent globally), as well as Software as a Service (SaaS), Big Data and Internet of Things.
The BT study polled 130 senior IT executives in Brazil and 825 IT decision-makers in the UK, US, Germany, Spain, Australia, Benelux and Singapore in November 2014.
