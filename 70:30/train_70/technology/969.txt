Friends Reunited relaunches
Friends Reunited, the 12-year-old UK-based social network, was relaunched on Tuesday.
The site was bought in 2009 from broadcaster ITV by Brightsolid, part of Scottish newspaper publishing group DC Thompson, for £25 million. ITV had previously bought the company for £175 million in 2005, when Friends Reunited claimed some 15 million registered users. Currently, around 1.5 million users visit the site monthly.

The site is free to use, getting revenue from advertisers. Brightsolid, which has bought online rights to a number of national archival services including the British Library newspaper collection, has previously concentrated on paid-for genealogy and associated historical research. It says it will add more archive material over time to Friends Reunited.
