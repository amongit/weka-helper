Microsoft Translator has the ability to translate over 45 languages with Klingon (plqaD) as one option. It states that it supports languages that cover more than 95 percent of worldwide gross domestic product (GDP).
The app offers automatic language detection in voice conversation mode. It will recognise which of the two selected languages is being spoken, allowing you to have a more fluid conversation with another person.
Google Translate has far more languages on offer (90). Here are the languages which the Google app supports which are not available for Microsoft Translator: Afrikaans, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Cebuano, Chichewa, Croatian, Esperanto, Filipino, Galician, Georgian, Gujarati, Hausa, Icelandic, Igbo, Irish, Javanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Khmer, Lao, Latin, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malayalam, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian, Myanmar (Burmese), Nepali, Punjabi, Serbian, Sesotho, Sinhala, Somali, Sundanese, Swahili, Tajik, Tamil, Telugu, Uzbek, Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu. It also enables you to read non-Latin scripts converted to English letters (e.g. Pinyin, Romaji).
Speech-to-speech translation makes it easy to have a natural conversation with someone in a foreign language.
Both apps offer downloadable offline language packs to enable translation when you are not connected to the Internet. However the voice translation feature requires an Internet connection for both products.
Neither product has autodetect for voice.

Microsoft Translator: To instantly translate using the camera; point the camera at the text you want to translate to your chosen language (top left image). You can use the lamp function to illuminate the text. The phone will vibrate when the text has been translated. The translation appears above the printed text in augmented reality as it is translated (bottom left image).
Tapping the screen will pause the real-time translation, copies the text to screen (right hand image) and enables the voice icon to hear the translation. The text translation can then be copied to the clipboard.

Google Translate has recently been updated to instantly translate text. Before this week's update, here is how the camera translate function works. Use the camera function to hover over the text and capture it in a still image. You can use the light function to better illuminate the text.
The app scans the text (top right image). Select the text manually (bottom left image) and the translation appears above the text (bottom right image).

the new Google Translate camera app will now instantly translate the chosen text, even without an Internet connection. Languages currently available are: English French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
Word Lens does seem to have a couple of issues with camera translation when it is pointed at glossy or curved objects with text.
