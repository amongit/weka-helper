â€‹Sling TV expands offerings with EPIX movies and VOD
Cord-cutting continues to leap forward in 2015 with Dish Network's Sling TV partnering with premium movie channel EPIX to bring all the EPIX movie channels and video-on-demand (VOD) to Sling TV Internet customers.
Sling TV will now no longer be just challenging the cable and satellite networks by bringing sports, via ESPN, to TV over the Internet. With this move, Sling TV is serving notice on HBO, Showtime, and Netflix that it's coming after their cord-cutting movie customers as well.
This new movie service will offer the full EPIX channel offerings. This includes EPIX, EPIX2, EPIX3 and EPIX Drive-In plus more than 2,000 movie and entertainment titles on-demand as part of its cord-cutter service.
To get this forthcoming movie service, you'll need to subscribe to Sling TV's base $19.99 package. This offering comes with, among other channels, ESPN, TNT, TBS, and CNN. It will soon include the movie channel AMC and other stations. Like Sling TV's packages: "Sports Extra," "Kids Extra" and "News & Info Extra," the EPIX package will come with an additional fee. While Sling TV declined to give a price, the service is offered on cable and satellite networks at prices varying from $5 to $15 a month.
Unlike the other movie networks, EPIX has experience with cord-cutting. In 2010, EPIX signed a deal with Netflix and a similar partnership in 2012 with Amazon Prime Instant Video to offer their library of new films from Paramount, Lionsgate and MGM to their customers. While EPIX allowed the Netflix deal to expire, EPIX movies are still available on Amazon. As Mark Greenberg, president and CEO of EPIX, said in a statement, "From the very creation of EPIX, we have sought to capitalize on new technology to reach people with our movies where they want them, when they want them and how they want them."
To watch Sling TV you'll need to use the Sling TV app on iOS, Android, Macs or Windows PCs. You will also be able to watch it on current-generation Roku devices and the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. In a few months, Sling TV will launch on Google's Nexus Player, webOS Smart TVs from LG Electronics, select Samsung Smart TVs, and Xbox One. Later, other streaming devices and smart TVs will be supported.
Sling TV will announce the launch date, package and pricing of EPIX by this spring.
