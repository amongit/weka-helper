How reliable are 4TB drives?
The friendly folks at Backblaze are back with the latest installment of their drive reliability series - now with 4TB drive data. Brian Beach's post is here.
Key points:
Here's a chart comparing failure rates in 2013 (gray bars) to 2014.

There were some teething pains with the 3TB drives, but it looks like the kinks were worked out with the 4TB drives. That's a good thing because my 3TB Seagate is filling up.
For those of buying one or two drives, this data is more comforting than conclusive. You never know if the couple of drives you buy come from a rare bad batch or got dropped by the shipping clerk.
But you improve your odds by following it. And it does confirm one piece of industry scuttlebutt: HGST makes high-quality drives.
Comments welcome, as always. There were some objections to Backblaze's numbers last year and here's my response.
