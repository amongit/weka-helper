They came together five months ago to bring some romance and excitement back to Irish football and while the honeymoon is not quite over yet for Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane, perhaps the initial spark has gone after this defeat.
Republic of Ireland were the better side for most of the first half, but missed good chances after they took the lead and made too many basic errors in defence, allowing Serbia to win a game they would have been relieved just to draw at half time.
Shane Long scored the first one after Branislav Ivanovic had under hit a back pass, but missed two after that, created by two magnificent passes from Wes Hoolahan.
“Shane Long had two wonderful chances after he had scored and given he took the first one with his weaker left foot, he might we have taken the other two with his right,” said O’Neill. “If we had scored then, we would have gone on to win the game.
“But I was pleased with his overall contribution and the most important thing is we are creating the chances. I’m genuinely pleased with a lot of things I’ve seen, not least the performance of Wes Hoolahan.”

O’Neill and Keane’s relationship has been a long distance one and this was only their third international game. They would have loved to freshen things up with a new generation of players, but there simply are not any to choose.
There is still a sense things are improving and Ireland played like a good O’Neill side should in the first half, attacking well down the flanks, full of energy through the middle and dangerous from set-pieces.
They could have scored after just two minutes when Glenn Whelan volley was touched in by Hoolahan, an incorrect offside flag chalking it off. “The referee has apologised,” said O’Neill.
Ireland lost momentum and Serbia equalised when James McCarthy turned Aleksander Kolarov’s cutback into his own net.
Long missed another chance after that, chipping wide, and Serbia scored their second through Filip Dordevic. Encouraging signs for O’Neill, but also evidence of size of the task ahead.
