Harry Kane named in England squad for Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and Italy friendly

Harry Kane’s welcome arrival in the England squad reflects the new depths of attacking talent available to Roy Hodgson, especially with Charlie Austin ignored by the seniors and Saido Berahino and Danny Ings left in the under-21s, but it has immediately highlighted an old problem: club versus country.
Hodgson is unimpressed that the Tottenham Hotspur striker is being made to go on a 21,000-mile return trip to Sydney for a post-season friendly at the end of a draining campaign and on the eve of the Uefa Under-21s Championship. There is no likelihood of a Kane mutiny as the forward is desperate to play for Gareth Southgate’s side in the Czech Republic, having been such a prolific force in qualifying.
So even a routine squad announcement for imminent internationals against Lithuania, a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, and a friendly with Italy in Turin, was immediately tainted by Premier League versus England tensions. Hodgson was asked more about Kane and Sydney than Wayne Rooney and boxing.

Kane’s workload even eclipsed the revelation that England players will not be allowed to cycle from their Euro 2016 hotel to their training pitch. “It would involve cycling on the road for a small amount of time,’’ sighed Hodgson. “For health and safety reasons, I have been told, it is not possible.”
It was Spurs’ spoke in the wheel of the under-21s that concerned Hodgson more. With the Premier League season concluding on May 24, Kane could fly out to Australia for the May 30 friendly on the back of playing 58 games for Spurs, England seniors and under-21s.
With Southgate’s under-21s kicking off their group against Portugal on June 18, and requiring at least a week’s preparation, Kane would be better served missing Sydney, the seniors’ subsequent games with the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia, and enjoying a brief rest after his season’s labours.
Kane has been rewarded for his fine form
Hodgson felt that commercial considerations dictated the club’s determination to take Kane to Sydney. Kane has already been used to promote the exhibition game involving Mauricio Pochettino’s side at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium. “Playing for England at under-21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in Australia,’’ said Hodgson.
This is not simply a story about one player; this episode reflects general concerns about burnout, about clubs’ power over the national team, the Football Association’s desire for youngsters to acquire tournament and the debate over when a player is considered a full senior and is not needed to drop down into the under-21s again.
“If he needs a rest, there’s a great opportunity when the season ends before our under-21s get together to give him a rest,’’ said Hodgson. “This is a marketing game as far as I can understand. Don’t forget these decisions are sometimes commercial.”
Spurs were trying to have it both ways, understandably celebrating Kane’s first England call which reflects well on all the good work they have done developing him, while tickets continued to sell to Kane fans in Australia.
Leaving aside the delicate negotiations that will have to go on with Spurs, and an obvious date presents itself on March 26 when England train at Enfield, Hodgson was enjoying his increasing attacking options.
Kane joins Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck as well as Rooney, the captain whose tally of 46 international goals is 13 more than the rest of the squad put together.
“I’d put Raheem Sterling in that group as well,’’ added Hodgson of the attacking corps. “They are enormously better, much better. They’ve got talent, there’s potential there, they’ve got skill levels that we haven’t always seen. They’ve got pace that we haven’t always seen. But getting to the top is the easy part, staying there is the hard part.”
Danny Ings has not been included by Roy Hodgson this time
As for Rooney’s kitchen-sink drama entailing a bout of sparring, Hodgson refused to condemn his captain despite the risk of injury. “When that happens, and we lose a player as a result of an incident like that, I will cross the bridge when I come to it but I saw him play on Sunday [against Spurs] and give an absolutely outstanding performance.
“The celebration for the goal? It was one way that Wayne decided to take some sting out of the situation and good luck to him. I thought it was a clever celebration. It showed where the situation or incident ranked in his list of priorities. Certainly his performance against Tottenham was fantastic and if he can produce anything like that for England in the next two games I will be very happy.”
He will see Rooney at St George’s Park on Monday. “We talk about a lot of things. I guess the subject will come up.’’
Rooney and all the other players involved in recent squads have been sent a video by England, involving an introduction from Hodgson, followed by the coaches Gary Neville and Ray Lewington delivering some thoughts on recent performances. “We sent videos to their iPads and got our message across. “It was all the tactical principles we’ve wanted to work on.”
Hodgson had hoped for a get-together in January to break up the long gap between the November and March internationals, going through topics now sent via tablets, but the clubs refused. “We found a way of bridging that gap, albeit that the first idea of actually getting together, all of us, and doing it face to face, and having a little bit of a dinner afterwards, would have been nicer for me but I fully understand why it didn’t work out.”
He does not know whether the players have viewed the clips yet. “I don’t want to start doing the Sherlock Holmes bit of finding out who has, and who hasn’t, watched it.” With files embedded by the FA, it should be elementary.
On assorted other matters, Hodgson said that “we believe in the qualities of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones”, that he was not yet rushing into any decision on extending his contract beyond Euro 2016 as “when a discussion comes around, we can think about it”, and that he wanted to show faith in Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw as “it’s important not to jettison them the first time they’re going through a rough patch”.
Hodgson also emphasised how disappointed he was by English clubs’ exit from the Champions League as it developed the abilities of players such as Welbeck and Joe Hart, whose prowess against Barcelona was described as “outstanding” by the England manager. “We’re not talking about any players. We’re talking about people like Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez."
