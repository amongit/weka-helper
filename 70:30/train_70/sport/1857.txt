Felix Sanchez Wins 2nd Olympic 400-Meter Hurdles Gold, Michael Tinsley Earns Silver
LONDON -- Felix Sanchez won his second Olympic 400-meter hurdles gold, and the Dominican Republic's first medal of the 2012 Games, by putting the field way behind down the stretch to finish in 47.63 seconds Monday night.
Sanchez, who turns 35 on Aug. 30, also was the 2004 Olympic champion.
He stuck his tongue out as he crossed the line and let out a scream. Then he knelt on the track, put down a photo of his late grandmother and kissed it, before tucking it into his uniform.
Michael Tinsley of the United States was second in 47.91, while Javier Culson got the bronze in 48.10 for Puerto Rico's first medal of the London Games.
Crowd favorite Dai Greene of Britain was fourth, and two-time Olympic champion Angelo Taylor was fifth.
