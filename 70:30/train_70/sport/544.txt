World Cup and European Championships will remain free-to-air on UK TV after Fifa and Uefa lose appeal

The governing bodies had challenged a European General Court decision made back in February 2011 that both tournaments could be legitimately classified by national governments as protected events.
But the European Court of Justice – the continent’s Supreme Court – said it it “dismisses the appeals brought by Fifa and Uefa in their entirety”.
Both organisations argued they should be allowed to sell matches not involving England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to the highest bidder, including pay-TV firms, claiming they could not get fair value from a market monopolised by terrestrial broadcasters.
The BBC and ITV had already secured the rights to broadcast next year’s World Cup finals but there had been fears that moves towards a pay-TV model would have been in place in time for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Even if Fifa and Uefa had won their case, home games matches would have remained free to watch in the UK, as would the opening match, semi-finals and final.
