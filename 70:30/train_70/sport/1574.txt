Viral Photographs Capture The Moment A Police Officer Helped A Struggling Runner Finish 10K Race
When it comes to her health, Asia Ford has come a long way in the last two years. Once weighing more than 470 pounds, exercise has helped the Kentucky woman shed more than 200 pounds.
Ford decided to take part in Sunday’s Rodes City Run 10K race in Louisville as a fitness challenge to herself. She’s been training for months and was determined to finish the race. But with about two miles to go, Ford found herself struggling.
That's when she received a helping hand from an unexpected source.
As The Courier-Journal reports, Louisville Metro Police Lt. Aubrey Gregory noticed that Ford was having difficulty, so he emerged from his squad car and approached the woman to see if he could offer assistance.
"As soon as I walked up to her, she immediately grabbed my hand," Gregory told the news outlet. She told him that she didn’t want to stop, to which he reportedly responded: “Good, then we're going to do this together.”
For the last two miles, Gregory held Ford’s hand and together, they walked toward the finish line.

The heartwarming images have since gone viral on social media.
On Facebook, Ford called Gregory her "angel."
According to WHAS 11, Fischer and other city officials will recognize Ford, Gregory and Jonathan Roberts, the photographer who captured the special moment, in a ceremony on Monday.
