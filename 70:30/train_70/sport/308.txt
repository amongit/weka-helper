Is this the greatest table tennis shot ever?

Behold - a ping pong shot like no other.
This wonderfully nonchalant spinning winner was captured at a friendly match between two players from the American sponsorship set-up "Team Nexy USA".
One thing you may not notice watching it for the first time is the excellent reaction of their one and only spectator as the sheer brilliance of what he's just seen slowly dawns on him.
Team Nexy's website says they are always on the look out for players who "love table tennis, know their game, love to wear TT gear, play often, compete, and love to talk equipment".
So, nothing about incredible pirouetting down-the-line winners, then, but they'll probably add it to the list.
