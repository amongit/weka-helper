GB's women's sitting volleyball team lost their opening encounter of the competition to the European champions Ukraine in straight sets.
Despite the loss, Martine Wright, who lost both her legs in the 7/7 bombings, said that heading out on court was "amazing."
"Playing the sport I love, in front of a crowd this enthusiastic was just a dream come true," she added.
Wright will need all her motivational powers to lift the British women, who now face Holland and then Japan in Group A. They must avoid defeat if they are to progress to the knock out stages.
