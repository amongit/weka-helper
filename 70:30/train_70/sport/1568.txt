Players should be role models - snooker chairman
Jason Ferguson, the chairman of snooker's governing body, tells the BBC that Mark Allen will face disciplinary action for the use of an expletive in his press conference, not his call for the resignation of Barry Hearn.
On the subject of Allen's criticisms of snooker chief Hearn and the reduced number of frames in early matches of the UK Championships, Jason says that this year's event has seen record ticket sales and that he's 'disappointed' Mark didn't voice his concerns earlier and in a more considered manner.
He also reassures the panel that there are no plans to tweak the format of the Masters or World Championships.
