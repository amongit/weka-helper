Hughes happy to bide his time on England question
Eligibility is a burning issue at the moment, with the New Zealanders Gareth Anscombe and Hugh Blake being selected for Wales and Scotland respectively, but for Wasps' Nathan Hughes it remains only a simmering issue as he continues to bide his time on deciding which country to represent.
The outstanding No 8 could opt for Fiji, Samoa or, in 2016 when he qualifies by residency, England. But at the moment he is not committing. "When the day comes to decide to play internationals, let it be," he said after Wasps' 20-20 draw with Leinster. "No one has spoken to me at all. I am just focusing on Wasps. England haven't been in touch because they can't really, because I haven't passed my residency eligibility yet. That is next year. I qualify for Fiji because I was born there and my mum is Samoan."
If you want to know what England think of him you only have to read what Graham Rowntree said at a press conference last week. "I like that Nathan Hughes," he said with a huge smile.
And he is right to. Hughes is some player. Wasps were not in the Leinster match until he began making his trademark gainline surges in the second half. He is still only 23. Imagine Ben Morgan, Billy Vunipola and Hughes all competing for the England No 8 shirt? Wow. Steve James

Player of the weekend Steffon Armitage Toulon
Man of the match (again) for Toulon against the Scarlets but the reigning European player of the year is no nearer the England squad. “He was outstanding, the turnovers he gets are incredible,” said Leigh Halfpenny.

Bath will not fear their trip across the Irish Sea

Home advantage in the quarter-finals? Bath were just relieved to be in the knockout stages at all, let alone worrying about where they would have to play, Dublin as it transpired.
In fact, even if the weekend results had worked out differently, they would not have been able to stage a European Champions’ Cup game at the Rec as its capacity (13,500) is too small for the tournament criteria in hosting a quarter-final.
As Bath themselves have shown on the road, notably with victories in this pool in Montpellier and Toulouse, and Glasgow illustrated, the home factor only takes you so far.
Glasgow were hugely under-strength due to injuries yet they came to the Rec with real zest and venom in their play, scoring fine tries through Alex Dunbar and Richie Vernon, very much the attitude Bath had taken to the Stade Ernest Wallon seven days earlier. And that is how they will have to approach their trip to Dublin in early April.
They are well-equipped to challenge the recent three-time European champions. Their pack got them out of trouble here, the basis for their two second-half penalty tries from a lineout drive and a heaving scrum, and will need to be to the fore again against Leinster.
The vaunted Bath backs were well-shackled but they, too, will relish the big Euro stage to come. The four English clubs are all on the road. Bath have proven seasoned travellers and will not fear the trip across the Irish Sea. Mick Cleary

Try of the weekend Richie Vernon Glasgow
Glasgow will rue the fact Vernon’s stunning score came in a losing cause, but it was a try of the very highest order. Over half the team touched the ball as Glasgow attacked from deep and the ball was eventually shipped wide for No.8 Vernon to slide in at the corner.

Lopez may be the best French fly-half in years

Whisper it quietly but France may start the Six Nations with a fly-half of both style and substance in Camille Lopez.
Such is the cult of the scrum-half – le petit general – across the Channel that the stand-off is often reduced to being a bystander. Lopez challenges that tradition.
He takes responsibility for goalkicking and more importantly ensures that he is the senior partner in half-pack partnership. Against Saracens, it was Lopez who took charge of the experienced scrum-half Morgan Parra who was bizarrely left out of France’s Six Nations squad only to be called up on Sunday.
There are wrinkles that need to be ironed out – his kicking from hand veered from the exact to the erratic – but clearly he is a fly-half who enjoys being in control whether taking the ball to the line or flinging out passes to his backline.
Giving the revolving door that is the French No 10 shirt there are no guarantees that Lopez will maintain his form nor that Philippe Saint-Andre will have a brainwave to install a winger there, but if the indications at the Stade Marcel-Michelin were anything to go by then Les Bleus may have finally have stumbled upon their first decent fly-half since the turn of the century.

Henderson boosts Six Nations hopes
Iain Henderson's return to action after a seven-month lay-off with a hip injury was not only critical to Ulster's 26-7 victory over Leicester Tigers at Ravenhill on Saturday but the 22-year-old made such an impact that he almost certainly thrust himself into contention for Ireland's Six Nations squad.
Henderson, who played in four of Ireland's Six Nations games last season and was hugely impressive on the tour of Argentina last June, is likely to come into reckoning for the blindside position, although he can also play lock.
The lay-off appears to have given him the opportunity to make significant gains in his power and physique, while he is also one of the quickest forwards in the squad.
And if there are no adverse reactions to his ferocious cameo on Saturday, which helped enable Ulster to dominate the collisions against Leicester, he could make a major contribution to Ireland's hopes of retaining their Six Nations title.
As for Leicester, Ben Youngs described their effort as naive and lacking in solutions to the problems caused by Ulster's blitz defence. Leicester required a bonus-point win to keep alive hopes of reaching the quarter-finals, but they never came close to achieving that goal.
"We are disappointed because this is a big competition for us and we haven't really got anywhere far in it for four or five years. This team is very ambitious and we haven't been able to back up that ambition which is frustrating," said Youngs. Gavin Mairs

Villain of the weekend Ashley Johnson Wasps

Wasps were chasing the game against Leinster after just 17 seconds when Johnson was sin-binned for idiotically taking out Dave Kearney in the air. It set the tone for a first half the visitors dominated.
