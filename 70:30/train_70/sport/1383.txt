West Brom have pulled striker Saido Berahino out of the England Under-21 squad because he has a foot injury.
The Baggies withdrew the 21-year-old on Saturday after he was substituted late in their 3-0 defeat by Manchester City at Etihad Stadium.
Gareth Southgate's men face the Czech Republic in Prague on Friday before hosting Germany three days later.
Berahino had been hopeful of playing but West Brom boss Tony Pulis is not willing to risk aggravating the injury.
The Burundi-born forward, who has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for the Under-21s, has been playing with the help of pain-killing injections in recent weeks.
After being named in the squad, Berahino had tweeted: "Always honoured to get picked for England U21, can't wait to meet up with the lads on Sunday."
The Football Association is yet to comment on Berahino's withdrawal.
