NASCAR's Kyle Busch Injured At Daytona Speedway
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) â€” Kyle Busch broke his right leg in a vicious hit Saturday into a concrete wall during the Xfinity Series race, and he'll miss the Daytona 500.
Busch sustained a right lower leg compound fracture and left mid-foot fracture in the crash with eight laps remaining Saturday at Daytona International Speedway.
Joe Gibbs Racing said he was undergoing surgery on his right leg and is out indefinitely.
The injury occurred when his car slammed head-on into an interior wall that did not have an energy-absorbing SAFER barrier.
It's a similar injury to the one suffered by Tony Stewart in a 2013 sprint car crash. His was a double compound, and he had a fourth surgery on it in December.
