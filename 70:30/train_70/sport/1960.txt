Miami Heat Locker Room Dance Party: Team Celebrates Eastern Conference Championship (VIDEO, PHOTOS)
No team plays under more pressure than the Miami Heat, so of course they let loose a little better, too.
And after taking a very, very close game 7 at home against the Boston Celtics to make the NBA Finals, it was time for -- what else? -- a locker room dance party. (Ronny Turiaf's not on the squad for nothing, you know.)
ESPN cameras caught the Heat hopping around the locker room to definitely not the tune the NBA layered over the clip before uploading to YouTube. After Dwyane Wade and Norris Cole took the floor first, Chris Bosh wandered in the room at just the right time and immediately began killing it with go-go-Gadget arms (just like the game!). Turiaf kept the frenzy alive until LeBron James hopped in, at which point the Eastern Conference Champs became a frenzy of limbs led by a man dressed hilariously for the moment like Audrey Hepburn in "Funny Face".
Watch your Miami Heat dance party above, and know this: we will no longer rest until we've hit Ultra with Ronny Turiaf.
