Lewis Hamilton pours derision on Red Bull and Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One fears

Lewis Hamilton has told his and Formula One's detractors he would beat anyone in the same car, pouring scorn on suggestions by Bernie Ecclestone and others that an urgent rewrite of the rules is needed to stop him dominating the sport.
As the world lined up to deride his emphatic victory in Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, Red Bull threw their toys out of the pram, threatening to quit F1, while Ecclestone gave his support to frantic attempts to slow Mercedes down. Hamilton was a rare voice of reason among his panicked rivals.

Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, had set the ball rolling in Melbourne by demanding the FIA, motorsport's governing body, come up with "equalisation" measures to prevent this year becoming a two-horse race. Not for the first time, Helmut Marko, the team's motorsport advisor, upped the ante by issuing yet another threat that the drinks giant might quit F1. The timing was opportunistic and clearly motivated by a large dollop of self-interest: in Australia, one Red Bull did not make it to the grid while the other finished a distant sixth.
Ecclestone, a long-time supporter of Horner, is evidently anxious not to lose the Austrian firm, as they make up two teams on the grid and one circuit on the calendar. But the 84-year-old was noncommittal about what he will do as chief executive to change the situation.

"They [Red Bull] are absolutely 100 percent right," said F1's supremo. "They (Mercedes) have done a first class job which everybody acknowledges. We need to change things a little bit now and try and level things up a little bit. We should support the FIA to make changes."
It appears that motorsport's governing body, under the leadership of the risk-averse Jean Todt, have no plans to intervene amid fears that another year of Mercedes dominance may force spectators and television viewers elsewhere.
Hamilton shrugged off pleas that he and Mercedes are legislated against, insisting that it made no difference who raced against him. He said: "I was sitting next to Sebastian [Vettel] after the race and I said, 'Sebastian, you did this for four years. You were 30 seconds ahead for four years.' So I know how it must have felt back then.

"Back then he had no-one behind pushing him. At least I've got my team-mate, who I was really racing. I don't remember that ever being the case [with Red Bull]. If I was 30 seconds ahead every race then maybe, but we are racing and ultimately I still have to get the better of another very, very good driver.
"But that's how Formula One is. There's isn't any doubt in my mind, if you want to put someone in the same car there is no doubt in my mind of where I would be finishing. People can create their own opinions. It's irrelevant. It is how it is."
The double world champion, bidding to be the only Briton ever to win back-to-back titles, said finding your way into the best car was part of the sport.
"There has never been a driver that has won the championship that hasn't had a great car that year, as far as I'm aware," the 30-year-old added. "There's no-one who had a Marussia and won the world championship, is there? Juan Manuel Fangio [five-time champion] still had a great car. It's the name of the game. You've got to have great equipment as well. I've got the car now and I'm driving the way I am and executing it."
But Hamilton's defence was not enough for Marko, who made his ultimatum through the Austrian media. "These rules will kill the sport," he said. "If we are totally dissatisfied we could contemplate an F1 exit. Yes, the danger is there that Mr Mateschitz [Red Bull owner] loses his passion for F1." Bizarrely, the drinks giant has a contract with Ecclestone which commits it to the world championship until 2020 and is precisely the reason why Red Bull are given such influence in the upper echelons of the sport.

Only Formula One, a sport capable of extraordinary levels of self-loathing, could allow itself to be consumed by such a debate after just one race of a season. Five years ago after a dreary opening affair in Bahrain there was a sudden clamour to declare F1 finished. It ended up being one of the most memorable seasons in history, with four drivers in contention for the title at the final round.
Jenson Button, the most experienced driver on the grid, admitted another year of Mercedes dominance would be a turn-off for the fans, but added that constantly curbing the best team's advantage defeats the object of Formula One.
"The sport is the victim, but the problem is it stops people from wanting to be the best, because as soon as they do a better job than anyone else, they're slated for it," Button said. "They're told they're damaging the sport. So it's a difficult situation. It obviously would be better if there were people fighting at the front that weren't just in a Mercedes, but it's not Mercedes fault. It's everyone else's fault that they're not competitive. I agree in one way, but would Red Bull be upset about it if they were the team out front by one second? No."
In fiery exchanges in Melbourne's Albert Park, Toto Wolff, Mercedes head of motorsport, suggested those "moaning" should make their complaints at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. He urged: "Get your f****** head down, work hard and try to sort it out."
