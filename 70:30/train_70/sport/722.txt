Great Britain’s men booked their place in the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships team final in Nanning on Saturday when they finished fourth in qualification.
Olympians Max Whitlock, Dan Keatings, Dan Purvis and Kristian Thomas plus World Championship debutants Nile Wilson and Courtney Tulloch posted a total of 357.193 points to finish behind China with 362.698, Japan on 361.609 and the USA with 360.393.
Britain won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London, but their best result at a World Championships is seventh.
Purvis and Wilson comfortably qualified for the top 24 all-around final, Purvis lying 10th with 88.706 and 18-year-old Wilson scoring 88.323 to take 13th place.
Qualification for individual apparatus finals was secured by Commonwealth and double European champion Keatings, who finished in eighth in the pommel and by Tulloch (fifth in the rings) and Wilson (sixth in the high bar).

Hungary’s Olympic champion Krisztian Berki is favourite for the pommel gold, and while eighth place in qualifying could have been seen as disappointing for Keatings, he was thrilled by it.
“YES!! I’m in the pommel final!! #buzzing #bringiton #excited,” the Briton said on Twitter.
The women’s qualification round begins on Sunday with the British women, including four-time Commonwealth champion Claudia Fragapane, in the second group who compete for the first time on Monday.
