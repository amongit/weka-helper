David Moyes is lining up a surprise move for Newcastle United's Sammy Ameobi.
Moyes, the Real Sociedad manager, is already stepping up his preparations for next season by making an approach to Ameobi, the younger brother of Shola.
Ameobi's deal at St James' Park expires at the end of this season and the 22-year-old forward is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs.
And Moyes is making a pitch to convince the England under-21 international to join him in San Sebasti√°n for the next campaign.
Moyes is understood to have met Ameobi's agent in Spain this week and is planning for the future by targeting young talent.

The former Manchester United manager is operating on a tight budget and is scouring Europe for free transfers or cheap deals.
Due to Ameobi's age, Newcastle would be entitled to compensation but the figure is expected to be minimal.
Newcastle, however, are keen to keep the former trainee and are believed to have opened talks over a new deal.
