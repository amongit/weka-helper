Uk Anti-Doping chief executive Andy Parkinson said Winston has been banned for two years for testing positive to methandienone, trenbolone, and tamoxifen during a drug test in November 2012, although the organisation wanted to impose the maximum four year sanction.
Winston admitted to taking the three drugs, two of which are potent forms of steroids. The third minimises the side effects of taking steroids. His immediate admission meant the longest sentence applicable under the current World Anti-Doping Agency rules was two years.
Parkinson said: “This case illustrates key issues raised in the ongoing review of the World Anti-Doping Code, notably the automatic benefit of a prompt admission.
"Mr Winston clearly intended to enhance his performance using more than one substance.
"By promptly admitting that he had committed an anti-doping rule violation, we were unable to seek a four-year ban in front of the National Anti-Doping Panel and were limited to a maximum sanction of two years.

“There are presently provisions in the Code to ban athletes for four years under aggravated circumstances, which we have successfully used in a number of cases, but when an athlete admits to a violation, these are not applicable.
"We do not think that this sends a strong enough message to the sports community and we will continue to press for tougher sanctions for serious dopers in the revised Code.”
Winston has been banned from competition until December 2014.
