Today’s Australian Open final, which may well be decided by the time of reading, is not just a contest between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic. Both men also like to share the glory with their respective pooches. Mr Murray has had his two dogs, Rusty and Maggie May, photographed posing alongside his trophies; Mr Djokovic has done the same with his pals, Pierre and Tesla, after a winners’ ball.
Are these dogs aware that they are a crucial part of the players’ team, as important as the coach or even the spouse? Do they try to help with physical training by stealing the balls and demanding to be chased? Do they bark support and abuse at the television when the game is being played? Or could it be that when their owner begs them to “please stand still for one second” in order to have their photo taken with a trophy, they imagine that it is, in fact, for them? “Finally,” Rusty says to Maggie May, “someone has recognised how much work we put into chasing cats. Of course, we don’t really do it for the medals. We do it for our country. And because cats are really, really annoying.”
Whatever the truth, let us hope that it is Mr Murray’s dogs who are on the front pages tomorrow. We will certainly be keeping our paws crossed.
