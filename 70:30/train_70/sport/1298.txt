Lee Westwood has said he was “only too happy to help” after being acclaimed as a “life-saver” by a businessman who the former world No 1 golfer pulled out of the sea in Barbados.
Westwood, on vacation with his family on the Caribbean island before making his seasonal bow at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic next week, was on the beach at the Sandy Lane resort last Friday when the alarm was raised.
Colin Davies described how the 41-year-old came to the rescue when he got into difficulty swimming in the Atlantic Ocean.
"If there is a power looking over us, I hope he takes note and delivers three majors to this kind and gentle human being,” Davies said. "I have Parkinson's disease so to enter the sea was foolhardy or stupid.
"As soon as I entered I realised I was in trouble. My legs wouldn't move, and my wife Linda was out of earshot. The family next to us on the beach heard my cry and within a second a muscular male grabbed me and, with tremendous but gentle care, got me back to my lounge bed.'

In the shock of the moment, Davies, a former Staffordshire miner, did not realise the identity of the Good Samaritan, only later discovering it was the nine-time Ryder Cup player. The millionaire from Solihull has been scouring the beaches to thank Westwood.
However, Westwood has returned to his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. When contacted by Telegraph Sport, on Wednesday he said: “Don’t get any red shorts, running down the beach, Baywatch images in your head! The gentleman was struggling to get back up on to the beach and I was only too happy to help.”
