3 Powerful Ways to Gain Control of Any Situation
When I was a kid, I was ice skating and remember going really fast. Next thing I recall I was being tended to in the changing room by my sister and employees of the skating center. Apparently I had been going so fast that I lost control, hit my head, and knocked myself unconscious. That incident rendered me fearful of the ice. Fast forward to 2012 when I was discussing this incident with 1994 Olympic speed skating Gold medalist Dan Jansen. He told me, "throw a helmet on and get back out on that ice." His advice was spot on. In the face of fear one must face it rather than avoid it. To ignore that which we're afraid of only gives the fear more power, while facing it will diminish it. This ice skating incident is perhaps a metaphor for other things in life.

They attempt to control what is out of their control, rather than what actually is within it.
Here's how you can gain control when you feel like you have none:

Next time you face a situation where you feel that you have no control; take some time to change your thinking. Below are some examples of how to take control. Use them as a guide when you look at your own life.


So next time you're stuck or feeling like you have no control, ask yourself: What do I actually have control over?
