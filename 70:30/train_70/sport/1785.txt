Coach K Return To USA Olympic Team No Longer Ruled Out
-- Mike Krzyzewski is no longer ruling out a return as coach of the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team.
Though the Duke coach had repeatedly said he wouldn't be back after last summer, USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo says they spoke about a week ago and there has been "movement" toward a return.
Krzyzewski told Sports Illustrated in a story Saturday that "there's a chance" he would lead the United States in 2016 for an attempt at a third gold medal.
Krzyzewski, 66, took over as U.S. coach in 2005. The Americans won a bronze medal in the 2006 world basketball championship and haven't lost a game since.
Even as Krzyzewski kept saying he was finished, Colangelo hoped he would reconsider. Colangelo wants a coach in place before the team holds a minicamp in July and believes there will be a decision soon.
The Americans' next tournament is the 2014 World Cup of Basketball in Spain.
