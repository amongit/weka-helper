Olympic skeleton bob champion Amy Williams still feels the need for speed

A desk. Amy Williams is sitting at her desk. The only British woman to win an individual Winter Olympic gold medal in the past 60 years is working, in an office, at her desk. For those who remember Williams at Vancouver in 2010, hurling herself down a frozen track on what appeared to be a large folding chair, this is a somewhat distressing image.
“I have my own stapler,” she says, talking me through her cache of office stationery. “And one of those really nice little rabbit things, with Sellotape coming out of its stomach. And a little bird with magnets, for your paper-clips to go on, even though I don’t think we use paper-clips.”
Fear not. Britain’s first lady of the ice is not a fully paid-up member of the nine-to-five, starchy-shirt brigade just yet. But having hung up her beloved skeleton bob Arthur last year (more on him later, by the way), even Olympic champions have to pay the bills somehow. Williams works in Bath for a consultancy firm called Wilsher Group as its director of high-performance teamwork.
“So I go into the corporate world, share my stories, tell them about my life as an athlete and help people find those extra little percentages in the business-place. If I’ve got nothing else going on, then I’ll come in every day. And if I do, then it might just be once a week.
“It’s good to have something that’s a bit solid. At least you’ve got some monthly pay coming in. But at the same time, I do have a lot on. I still have my agents, who bring in another kind of work. When that’s really quiet, I can obviously spend more time here. When I’m really busy on the other side, they accept it.” And it is the 'other side’, one suspects, that really interests Williams.

Dakar 2013: Facing the elements
On Thursday she will make her World Rally Championship debut in Wales: a second sporting career, or perhaps even third if you count her early incarnation as a 400-metre runner.
As co-driver to Tony Jardine, Sky’s Formula One pundit and experienced rally participant, she will be hurtling around the same course as the likes of Sebastien Ogier, Robert Kubica and Thierry Neuville. Qualification came in the form of four national rallies earlier in the year.
“I guess I’m with the big boys now,” she says. “I didn’t quite realise the importance of it until this last rally, when I met Sebastien Ogier at Castle Combe. Then it just sort of hit me. I’m going to be rallying with these guys in a few weeks. Yes, they’re probably going to be a lot faster, but if me and Tony can get over the finish line, it’ll be quite an amazing achievement.”
From the bobsleigh track to the rally course: you will doubtless have deduced that the talented Miss Williams has something of a thirst for speed. But naturally, there is more to co-piloting than that.
“I didn’t realise how much of a job the co-driver has,” Williams says. “I thought it was just reading out pace notes. That’s the least of your worries. You’re almost like the team manager keeping everyone in check. Going into the services, you’ve got to tell the mechanics how long they’ve got on the car.
"If I hand in the time card a minute too early or late, we get penalised. So from the moment you wake up, you’re pretty much in control of everyone. The co-driver can never take a breather. That’s a different kind of pressure.”
Williams and rallying collided quite by chance. Rally driver Mark Higgins happened to see her doing a rallying challenge on Sky celebrity panel show A League Of Their Own, and told Jardine of her potential. Jardine got in touch with Williams, who despite never having given the sport more than a moment’s thought, said yes immediately.
“Being in an office is not my style,” she says. “Yes, I’m sitting behind a desk trying to type emails, but that’s definitely not who I am. Being an athlete, although you’re very structured, although you probably know what weights you’re going to lift five months down the line, you still had your own life. Your day was done by 4pm with your last session.
"Now I’ve retired, I’ve suddenly realised I’ve still got a competitive streak inside me. Half of me sometimes wishes that I just had a 9-to-5, be home every night. And yet I know I wouldn’t like that. I love being outdoors.”
In her head, the foray into rallying is intended to be temporary. But in a way, the bug has bitten. “Now that I’ve done all of this, it would be a shame never to use my international licence. I could put a 'For Sale’ sign on my head and see if anyone wants to use me for the odd race. But Ski Sunday is starting up on the BBC, and then the Winter Olympics, so I’m busy until February and March.”
The trip to Sochi will stir mixed emotions. As an athletes’ ambassador for the British Olympic Association and BBC pundit, Williams will be in the thick of the action, yet without being able to defend the title she won almost four years ago.
“It will be strange, and I’m preparing myself for it . I will probably find it quite tough, and in a bizarre way quite upsetting, that I’m not competing. I know I had to listen to my body – it was pretty much broken. But half of me still really believes I could get another medal. Half of me, I’m sure, would love to grab a sled and quickly go down myself.”
And yet the time for that has passed, leaving Williams and us with only memories. While Williams has another life to pursue, her companion for that crazy ride in Vancouver has had a more uncertain fate. “I don’t know where Arthur is,” she says, her voice cracking a little.
“I had to give him back. Technically he wasn’t mine, he was the association’s. I’ve got elements of him — the belly pad, the fibreglass bottom, my runners, my saddle. But the heart and soul of him, I don’t know. Maybe he’s on the wall of UK Sport. He’s somewhere.”
On that bittersweet note, our time is up; not because we have run out of conversation, but because “everyone’s leaving the office”, in the words of Williams. “My friend Rose’s selection race didn’t go as she’d hoped, and I promised her a cup of tea and a chat. So I’m off to go and be friend-mentor-helper Amy.” Friend, mentor, helper; runner, sledder, co-driver. Being Amy Williams comes with a multitude of job descriptions.
