Business of sport is more a question of unforeseen consequence and cock-up than conspiracy

One of the unforeseen consequences of writing a weekly column is that eventually, you are unable to consume any form of culture without wondering how you might be able to apply it to your own milieu.
So you’re reading an interview with Stefan Edberg or someone, and you think: maybe there’s a column in this. Or that New Yorker article on Guinea’s mineral reserves: surely a column in there. That panini I had for lunch is, on reflection, the perfect recurring column metaphor: the crisp flatbread of sporting combat, the gooey melted Brie of hero worship, the chewy bacon of corruption. Laptop on; let’s make this work.
Apologies, then, if everything that follows seems just a little too elaborately confected. But earlier this week I was watching , the new Adam Curtis documentary for the BBC, and the mind went on one of its wanders.
Curtis is a fascinating artist. His films, interspersing vivid archive footage with stern narration, are part politics lesson and part music video. Over the last couple of decades, they have painted an abstract portrait of humanity in all its ugly beauty. Bitter Lake – available on the iPlayer – is a tale of post-war geopolitics, told through the intimate lens of modern Afghan history.
And the story Curtis tells is defined not so much by human evil as human incompetence: not just bad intentions, but good intentions gone wrong. American firms arrived in Helmand in the 1950s to build giant dams, and ended up fundamentally altering the soil composition, making it perfect for growing opium poppies. The Russians tried to build a socialist idyll there in the 1980s, and not only failed but virtually destroyed itself in the process. Franklin Roosevelt did an oil deal with Saudi Arabia and unwittingly unleashed half a century of Wahhabi Islam on the Middle East. Disastrous and far-reaching consequences sprang from the most innocuous of decisions, and were exacerbated by a toxic blend of ineptitude and hubris.

I wonder if there is anything sport can learn from all this. There is an instinctive distrust of power in Curtis’s work that is reflected across society, and thus sport, as a whole. Whether it is a governing body, the media or whoever it is that chooses Premier League referees, our esteem for sporting authority has never been at a lower ebb. Where venality and moral rot was once suspected, it is now assumed.

For example, let’s take the 2022 World Cup, an outrage of a tournament, awarded on a lie and secured by deceit. The decision to go with Qatar looks increasingly unjustifiable, given the immense human suffering it has caused. Does this make Fifa evil? A lot of people would argue that it does.
Then you have the ICC, currently accused of throttling the soul of cricket by contracting the next World Cup to 10 teams. Are the ICC trying to kill cricket in smaller nations? A lot of people would argue that they are. But expressing these issues as simple moral parables is often a cop-out, employed to elide the staggering complexity within them.
The Qatar disaster sprang from the relatively insignificant decision to invite bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups simultaneously, to guarantee television revenue and allow hosts maximum preparation time. Few could have anticipated the full, orgiastic scale of vote-trading and graft that ensued. It is possible to trace everything that followed – the suppressed investigation, the insulting excuses, the arch finger-pointing – to that initial blunder.
The contraction of the Cricket World Cup stems from a chance event: the shock first-round elimination of India and Pakistan in 2007, which gave way to a mind-numbingly dull second stage, and prompted endless tinkering of the format in an attempt to make it more interesting. At the same time, the success of the Indian Premier League completely transformed the economy of the sport. Administration in the smaller Test nations began to crumble. The more fires the ICC tried to fight, the more they somehow made things worse. Now hindsight – and the Associate nations – are making them look very stupid indeed.
The point is that notions of good and evil, innocent and corrupt, are not always useful, or even all that accurate. Malign consequences are not always analogous with malign motives. What is commonly perceived as moral bankruptcy is often a spiralling accumulation of naivety, avarice, arrogance and self-preservation: four very human flaws.
We readily assume that those in power are fully aware of the ramifications of their actions. But in truth, nobody is. And it scares people to confront the idea that their worlds are governed by chaos, chance and idiocy. Far more comforting to imagine that we are ruled by evil super-tyrants, than by flawed and incompetent human beings like ourselves.
