Fernando Alonso to undergo medical assessment in Cambridge ahead of potential Formula One return

Fernando Alonso will be assessed by three medical experts at Cambridge University on Sunday to see if he is able to return to Formula One.
Telegraph Sport understands that Alonso, who missed the season-opening Australian Grand Prix after suffering a concussion in a testing accident last month, will see the doctors at the request of the FIA, motorsport's governing body. Given the unexplained nature of his crash, they are eager to be as thorough as possible with Alonso.
The Spaniard, who has rejoined McLaren this season on a Â£25 million a year deal, will face a full medical examination. The Cambridge doctors will also study all the scans that Alonso has had to date.
Should the 33-year-old be cleared fit, he will travel to Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Grand Prix next Sunday but will still have to clear two further hurdles on Thursday morning before he is allowed to race.

Medical help: Alonso was airlifted to hospital after his crash The first is a medical exam by the chief doctor at the Sepang Circuit. The second is the FIA's 'impact test', which measures reaction times using a computer programme, and will be conducted by the chief medical officer, Jean-Charles Piette. Only once Alonso has met all three challenges successfully will he get back behind the wheel of his McLaren.
Alonso's manager, Luis Garcia Abad, has said the tests should be a "formality" but McLaren are eager to avoid complacency and are anxious to simply wait until they are given medical advice.
Having completed a successful run in McLaren's state-of-the-art simulator last Wednesday, Alonso will travel to Cambridge on Sunday, before returning to his home in Dubai. Should he be given the all-clear, he will fly to Kuala Lumpur, most likely on Tuesday.
Alonso himself is said to be concerned by the unexplained circumstances which surround his accident at the Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. The Spaniard briefly blacked out after the impact and has no recollection of the crash.
McLaren have been accused of adding to the mystery with a series of blunders by the team's chairman, Ron Dennis.
All that is certain is that whoever drives the McLaren in Malaysia - Alonso or his replacement in Melbourne, Kevin Magnussen - it will be slow. The team's new Honda engine is unreliable and way off the pace. Jenson Button finished the first race of the year last.
