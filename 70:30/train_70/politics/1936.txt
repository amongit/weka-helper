Catholic Church Urges Britons To Consider Social Issues Before Voting
LONDON (AP) - Roman Catholic bishops in Britain have joined their Church of England counterparts in urging the faithful to vote in the forthcoming national election, and to consider a range of social issues before casting their ballots.
The open letter issued Tuesday appealed to Catholics to "think about the kind of society we want here at home and abroad."
Though the letter did not urge Catholics to vote for a particular party, it outlined issues for them to consider, such as policies on abortion, climate change and fair pay. The letter noted that "people are not merely economic units to be exploited."
Church of England bishops recently called for a fresh moral vision for Britain as they issued a 52-page letter arguing that every Christian should vote on May 7.
