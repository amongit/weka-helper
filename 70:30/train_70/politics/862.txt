Obama Faces SOTU Fatigue
President Barack Obama could draw the lowest viewership Tuesday evening for any of his State of the Union addresses, and White House officials know it. As a result, Obama and his team are handling the State of the Union runup in a more aggressive way this year.

Obama and his aides have been announcing a new initiative every few days, trying to create interest in the speech, during which he will also talk about these ideas. He has already revealed a proposal to make community college free for millions of students. And Thursday he is scheduled to announce his support for authorizing federal agencies to give their employees up to six weeks of paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child. He also will urge that such a benefit be extended to all American workers, White House officials say.
Obama's past pattern has been to save his initiatives for one big rollout in the president's annual speech to a joint session of Congress.
But interest in such addresses has been waning. Obama got his lowest SOTU viewership yet with 33 million viewers last year. That's a lot of people, but it's far below the 52 million who tuned in for his first address to a joint session of Congress in 2009. And it's even further behind the 62 million who watched George W. Bush in 2003, amid rising concern about a war with Iraq. Bill Clinton got the worst rating for any SOTU in recent times, 31 million for his final SOTU in 2000, and he also got the top rating, nearly 67 million viewers, for his first address to Congress in 1993, according to statista.com.
White House officials are fighting the tendency of Americans to tune out the president because his ideas and performance have become so familiar. "We're programming around that fact," a White House official told CNN.
