Delhi elections: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee appeals all to vote for AAP
New Delhi: West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Thursday appealed to the people of Delhi to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidates during the Assembly elections on February 7.
In a tweet, Banerjee said, "Delhi elections on 7. My request to all of you in Delhi to please vote for AAP. For the greater need of the country and development in Delhi".
Banerjee's appeal to the people to vote for the AAP is significant since her TMC is locked in a stiff battle with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for political supremacy in West Bengal. She has been accusing the BJP of manipulating the arrest of TMC leaders suspected of involvement in the Saradha chit fund scam.
However, the appeal is important for the AAP which is engaged apparently in a neck-and-neck fight with the BJP in Delhi. It comes as a shot in the arm for AAP with the Left already having pledged its support to it. Prakash Karat of CPM said his party will support AAP on the seats where they have not fielded their own candidates.
