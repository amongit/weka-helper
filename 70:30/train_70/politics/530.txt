Trey Radel, Former GOP Congressman Busted For Cocaine, Starting Crisis PR Firm
Former Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.), who resigned from Congress last year after pleading guilty to charges of cocaine possession, is starting a his own public relations firm for crisis management.
According to the firm's website, the Trey Radel Media Group offers "highly personalized training to message and manage media" as well as "preparation to present, testify or advocate before Congress." The firm's website also lists working with non-native English speakers as one of it's specialties.
The website also gives some free advice: when faced with a crisis, logic may not matter that much.
"Legal and political battles are no longer in courtrooms or Congressional committees. Wars are fought and won in the media, driven by foot soldiers in social media. The battles are no longer even fought with facts, figures or logic. They’re fought with emotion," the website says.
"It’s not what you say. It’s how they feel."
Radel announced that he was starting the firm on Twitter on Thursday.
Thank you for the kind support this past year. Proud to share what's next. More here & check out rest of site. http://t.co/UU6hCzuHpB

The site for the three-person firm features a bio for Radel and mentions his time in Congress and mentions "ups and downs," but does not give the reason that he resigned.
Authorities expunged Radel's record last year after he completed his probation ahead of schedule.
