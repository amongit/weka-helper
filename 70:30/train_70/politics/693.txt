Jeb Bush Will 'Actively Explore' Running for President
Jeb Bush announced on his Facebook page Tuesday morning that he is considering a run for the White House. He plans to kick off his campaign by forming a political action committee in January.
Bush, who served as governor of Florida between 1999 and 2007, wrote that he had talked to his wife, Columba, and their children about "the future of our nation," and now has "decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States."
A Sunday announcement from the Bush team that he would release 250,000 emails from his time as governor and also write an e-book ramped up speculation about a presidential run. The brother of former President George W. Bush and son of former President George H.W. Bush, Jeb Bush has made two campaign trips thus far in 2014, both to South Carolina. In October, he met with supporters and headlined a fundraiser for Gov. Nikki Haley and the South Carolina GOP. Over the weekend, he spoke at the University of South Carolina's winter commencement.
In comparison to other potential candidates in our presidential tracker, Bush hasn't traveled much to the early primary states, which will no doubt change after today's announcement.
