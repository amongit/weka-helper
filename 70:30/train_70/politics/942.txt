Political Women
Many Republicans in the consultant class regard the current demographic trends as the enemy. They cannot come up with solutions, with ways to integrate the party and its message into the future reality of what America will look like. Instead, most likely out of frustration, they stand on the sidelines and “curse the darkness,” arguing against efforts to broaden the base and make the party more inclusive.
It is not necessary that the GOP dilute its core message or compromise on basic principles in order to maintain its majority. America is still a center-right country. The party does not have to suddenly embrace tax increases or abortion on demand or gun control to remain competitive nationally; indeed, most of the available evidence suggests any movement in those directions would run counter to its long-term viability. What it does have to become is smarter, something that starts with making worthwhile investments in the political futures of candidates who will someday run for statewide office and who are not exclusively white, male and Protestant.
There are, for example, more women in Congress now than ever before. Yet the partisan split favors Democrats by almost 3-to-1 – indicating the GOP has a long way to go before it is on anything close to resembling equal footing. But Political Parity, a program of Hunt Alternatives, is out with a study, “Republican Women and the GOP Gender Gap: Clearing the Primary Hurdles,” that explores this phenomena and makes useful recommendations about what the party can do to persuade more women to run for Congress.

“The GOP has traditionally been gender neutral regarding candidate recruitment and support,” former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor and Political Parity Co-Chair Kerry Healey said. “Many in the party are now taking a second look at how this choice has impacted electability and growth. This data is exactly what’s needed to encourage even the most pragmatic GOP leadership to see the value of actively promoting conservative women as candidates, not only as voters or activists.”
In compiling the report, researchers found Republican woman often less likely than their Democratic peers to win or even enter a primary election which, it seems obvious, is the jumping-off point for any eventually successful congressional bid. Those who do run, they concluded, are often left without the coaching and support generally found in winning campaigns.
"Women's political progress has flat-lined in part because Republican women are sidelined," Political Parity Director Marni Allen said. "Our research reveals that GOP women struggle to overcome structural, financial and ideological hurdles in their party's primary. With a more polarized electorate and without greater support and coaching, they remain stuck in the starting block."

While many factors affect candidates in campaigns, the report says, GOP women face higher hurdles in three key areas: infrastructure, where they often face fractured or fragmented support; inattention, especially from established party organizations that fail to provide sufficient training and candidate development; and, ideology, where women candidates must frequently overcome the misperception that they are more moderate on the issues than their male counterparts. “No single factor is make-or-break,” the report states, “but together they dramatically hinder Republican women’s chances for electoral success.”
Success will be found, the report asserts, in the GOP’s adopting a more sophisticated approach to candidate recruitment and development. To that end it offers the following advice:

Opening up the GOP to women who want to run for state and national office is not as much of a reach as some people may think. There are a number of women – South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Reps. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Martha Roby of Alabama and Kristi Noem of South Dakota among them – who would be excellent role models precisely because they surmounted the very obstacles the report identifies. If they, and others like them, could devote at least a part of their time and talents to helping recruit and support other women who might like to join them in elected office, it will transform the public face of the Republican Party for the better.
