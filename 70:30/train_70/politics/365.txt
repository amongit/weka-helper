Delhi elections: Kiran Bedi writes to EC objecting to fatwas, says they impact voting
New Delhi: A day after losing miserably to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi Assembly elections, former IPS officer Kiran Bedi, who was Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) chief ministerial candidate, has complained to the Election Commission alleging that issuing of 'fatwas' impact voting.
Bedi on Wednesday said, "Fatwas impact voting. They definitely impact the mindset."
Bedi, who lost in her Krishna Nagar constituency, further said, "In my constituency, I was winning till voting started. In some areas where fatwas were issued, it started dropping."
She said she has written to the Election Commission. "They should look into it," she said.
On Tuesday, Bedi had conceded defeat and apologised to the BJP leadership for not being able to live up to the expectations of the people of Delhi.
In a nail-biting finish, Bedi lost to AAP's SK Bagga on a seat that has been BJP's bastion.
Bringing in Bedi as its face in Delhi polls, the BJP had thought that it would be able to make a mark yet again like it did in all the elections in recent past. The party inducted Bedi just a few days before the polls and announced her as its CM candidate.
However, she failed to make a mark in the national capital. 2015 being the first election for Bedi, the BJP fielded her on the safest seat - Krishna Nagar - which has been held by party leader Harshvardhan since 1993. Ironically, she could not catch the pulse of her constituency too and lost the polls.
