Police allow AAP candidate Naresh Balyan to appear for interrogation after Delhi elections
New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Naresh Baliyan will be interrogated by the Delhi Police crime branch after Delhi elections in connection with liquor found at a warehouse owned by him.
Delhi Police had said Balyan had to join the probe otherwise they will take legal action in the recovery of hundreds of liquor bottles from his property. AAP leaders Ashutosh and Ashish Khetan met Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi alleging that there was pressure on the police regarding Balyan. Bassi allowed Balyan to appear after the elections.
AAP leader Sanjay Singh said, "We spoke about Balyan to the police. We told them that Balyan will not be able to come till Saturday as he is busy in election work."
An AAP delegation had also met the Election Commission alleging that Balyan was being falsely implicated.
On AAP's allegation that Delhi Police was working under pressure, Bassi said Baliyan was a suspect and that is the reason why he was called for questioning. "We had evidence therefore we summoned Baliyan. We are not harassing anybody. Delhi Police is independent. We will not tolerate any kind of pressure from anybody," he said.
