Obama Cardboard Cutouts Embraced Around The World (PHOTOS)
Everyone wants a piece of Barack Obama.
But since that is rather unpractical, people are making do with cardboard cutouts of the winner.
In a matter of hours, these life-size standups, which are available in a variety of different postures and poses, became omnipresent in the post-election frenzy that took over the globe.
Fervent supporters, whether in Washington, Kabul or Tokyo, embraced the cardboards in souvenir photo snaps, embassy celebrations, and other occasions.
“We’re really happy to be here and we’re happy to have the president here, too,” CCTV quoted Julie Buchanan, as saying in Toronto -- referring to Obama's cardboard alter-ego.
Obama landed another four years in the Oval office on Tuesday night, after defeating his Republican rival Mitt Romney.
Take a look at the most awesome Obama-cardboards in the slideshow below.
