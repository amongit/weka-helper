Poll: Voters Want Change in 2016
Bad news for Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, the two potential "dynasty" candidates in the 2016 presidential campaign: Most Americans want change in the next White House, and they don't believe either Bush or Clinton would provide it.
Fifty-nine percent of voters prefer a "change" candidate to an experienced and tested one, up from 55 percent in July 2008 when Barack Obama was on his way to winning the White House with a promise of "hope and change," according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

Sixty percent say Jeb Bush, the former two-term Republican governor of Florida, brother of President George W. Bush and son of President George H.W. Bush, would represent a return to policies of the past. Fifty-one percent say the same about Hillary Clinton, spouse of former President Bill Clinton, former secretary of state and ex-Democratic senator from New York.
Clinton is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination if she runs as expected. Bush is a serious contender for the GOP nomination if he runs as anticipated.
Within their respective parties, Clinton is in a much better position than Bush is. Forty-two percent of Republicans say Bush represents a return to the policies of the past, and 49 percent of GOP voters say he would provide new ideas and a vision for the future. But 73 percent of Democrats say Clinton would provide new ideas for the future and 24 percent of Democrats say she represents a return to the policies of the past.
Only 49 percent of potential Republican primary voters say they could support Bush while 56 percent say they could back Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 53 percent say they could back Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.

Eighty-six percent of Democrats say they could support Clinton for their party's presidential nomination. Her closest potential competitor is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who gets 34 percent but who says she isn't running. Vice President Joe Biden gets 14 percent.
GOP pollster Bill McInturff, who helped conduct the survey with Democratic pollster Peter Hart, told NBC, "Clinton's numbers are just extraordinary from a starting point in a primary. A number in the mid-80s is stunning."
