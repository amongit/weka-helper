"[President] Clinton was only able to get 45 or so for fast track, and congressional Democrats liked him."
Combined with Republicans, just enough to pass
"Labor is pulling out all the stops. Obama will get it across the finish line, but barely."
"Trade votes are bad for Dems, but enough will vote yes to pass TPA."
"With Obama's international standing sliding, this is a must-win for the administration. They'll make it worthwhile for enough Dems to bring it off."
"Dems will be pressed to get 30 votes."
A significant minority
"It's on the Obama agenda, not the House Dem agenda."
Around half
"Will become the shining example, and maybe the only example, of the Dems' and GOP's ability to work together. Sad."

"A good example of Obama not doing even the smallest charm offensive to woo Republicans on issues they are inclined to support. A rare instance where he's right on the politics, but his personality stinks in the eyes of key GOPers."
"Democrats are no longer a party of trade and economic growth."
Combined with Republicans, just enough to pass
"A real test of loyalty to Obama versus fear of the far Left, and the far Left wins over most Democrats."
"Every major Democratic interest group is anti-trade, and the special interests runthe party. Ultimately, the votes in Congress will be there, just barely."
"This is one area where Democrats will treat their president like a lame duck."
"Going to be 218 and not a single vote more."
Around half
"Union clout, except for public employees, is waning in Washington. That's good news for free trade."
