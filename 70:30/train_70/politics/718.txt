After Lackluster Black Friday, Shoppers May See More Discounts
After disappointing sales Black Friday weekend, retailers could face another headache heading into the holiday shopping season: too much inventory. But that means consumers – especially those who procrastinate – may benefit from retailers’ overzealous holiday outlook.
The National Retail Federation reported Sunday that Black Friday weekend sales were projected to decline to $50.9 billion this year from $57.4 billion in 2013 – a drop of 11 percent. While the figures suggest retailers could face a surplus of unsold inventory in December, the federation still was upbeat, noting how retailers are spreading out their discounts rather than dumping them all on Black Friday.
“We remain positive about the future of sales for this holiday season, but it’s a marathon and not a sprint,” Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the trade group, wrote in a blog post Monday. “Many consumers are far from finished with their shopping, and retailers are still working hard to earn every sale.”

Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, describes upcoming December shopping as a “game of chicken,” as stores grapple with having to offer lower prices to lure in consumers.
“It definitely feels like retailers were planning for a big Christmas season, which means they’re probably sitting on a lot of inventory. While they’re not going to panic just yet, I bet they’re getting pretty nervous if things were disappointing for them over the course of this weekend,” Stanley says. “They’re really going to be vulnerable to needing to discount heavily at the end to get stuff out the door.”
The National Retail Federation anticipates overall holiday sales to grow 4.1 percent this year to $616.9 billion. And according to the trade group, while Black Friday is the biggest shopping day of the year, the Saturday and Sunday before Christmas – when many Americans scramble to finish up last-minute shopping – also are highly important for retailers.
The post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy isn’t isolated to one day, either: Stores like Target and Wal-Mart, for example, offered pre-Black Friday deals and will continue discounting throughout “Cyber Week,” which lasts from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6. It’s hard to avoid the barrage of online ads for holiday discounts that retailers hope will attract shoppers.

“If, however, consumption falls short, producers will be sitting on an even larger stockpile of goods,” Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee, wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Inventory growth has already been quite robust for the past two quarters, suggesting many retailers need consumers to not just ramp up spending, but go out and spend like it's 1999, or at least like the pre-Recession years.”
The Labor Department has reported that monthly job gains over the past six months have been the strongest since 1999. That fact and a tail wind from lower gas prices – AAA says the national average has fallen for 67 days straight and is the lowest in more than four years – make analysts generally optimistic about consumer spending heading into the final month of 2014.
In fact, Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, cautions against reading too far into the early holiday shopping results.
O’Sullivan calls the National Retail Federation’s Black Friday shopping survey, which featured 4,600 consumers on Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving, “volatile” and “not very accurate.” O’Sullivan noted in a chart released Monday that over the last four years, Black Friday sales as measured by the federation have ranged from year-over-year dips of 3 percent to surges of 16 percent, while comparable retail sales figures for November and December have ranged from gains of 3 to 5 percent, according to Census Bureau data.
