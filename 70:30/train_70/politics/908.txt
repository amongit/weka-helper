GOP Ads Tie Democrats to Obama
With the midterm elections a week away, Republicans are making their final appeal to voters, emphasizing a harsh indictment of President Barack Obama and fellow Democrats for taking a dangerous path on national security.
"President Obama's actions threaten the safety of our country," said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a new digital ad entitled "Obama's Foreign Policy is on the Ballot." Priebus added: "While ISIS (an Islamic extremist group) plots ways to destroy our way of life and Ebola infects American citizens, the president continues to go around the Constitution and Congress to move terrorists from Guantanamo Bay into our nation. This November, the president's policies appear on the ballot. I urge you to vote Republican to keep terrorists off U.S. soil." Regarding Guantanamo, Priebus was apparently referring to a Wall Street Journal report that Obama is considering unilateral action to bypass Congress and close down the controversial detention facility at Guantanamo after the midterm elections.

In addition, the National Republican Congressional Committee is running new TV commercials in targeted House districts that attempt to tie Democratic incumbents and Democratic challengers to Obama and, in some cases, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a liberal who was speaker of the House when the Democrats held a majority in the chamber.
In an ad criticizing Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., Obama is shown saying that even though he is not on the November 4 ballot, "every single one" of his policies are up for voter approval or disapproval in the form of contests for the House and Senate. A narrator says, "A vote for Nick Rahall is a vote for the Obama agenda." A similar ad is running in Georgia against Democratic Rep. John Barrow, according to CNN.
The GOP ads are running in eight states where there are competitive Senate races – Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Louisiana and Virginia – according to an RNC spokeswoman.
Meanwhile, Obama is making his final case to voters in an effort to prevent the Republicans from taking control of the Senate from Democrats and from making gains in the GOP-controlled House.

For his part, Obama plans to campaign in Milwaukee Tuesday; Portland, Maine, Thursday; Rhode Island Friday; Michigan Saturday, and Pennsylvania and probably Connecticut Sunday.
Obama is trying to increase turnout among Democratic groups that supported him in 2008 and 2012, such as African Americans, Latinos, single women and young people. The problem for Obama and the Democrats is that the pro-Obama enthusiasm within these groups, except for African Americans, has declined, according to various polls. And Obama has steered clear of campaigns in states where he is unpopular, including Alaska, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina.
On national security issues, Democratic strategists say Obama is taking a carefully thought-out, prudent course on many fronts that will stand the test of time even if his decisions aren't popular at the moment.
