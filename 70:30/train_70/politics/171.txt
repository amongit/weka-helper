Poe, Royce, Sherman, Engel: Four lawmakers take on ‘cyber jihad’ in social media
A quartet of congressmen applauded Twitter for recently shutting down 2,000 accounts established by “foreign terrorist organizations” that are using an American-based social media company, they say, to fundraise, spread propaganda and recruit members.
But it’s not enough. Republican Reps. Ted Poe of Texas and Ed Royce of California, plus Democrats Brad Sherman of California and Eliot Engel of New York, don’t want to stop there. What about the other 46,000 Twitter accounts, as revealed in the “ISIS Twitter census,” a Brookings Institution metadata analysis? The researchers recommend that the U.S. government and private providers join forces to develop “appropriate responses to extremism” in social media.
“We applaud your removal of some terrorist content, which has provoked serious threats against Twitter and its employees. However, we urge Twitter to treat all terrorist activity in the same way it treats other objectionable content,” the four lawmakers wrote in a letter to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. “Users should have the option to report terrorist content in a streamlined manner, allowing Twitter to quickly block content and accounts that support terrorism, and Twitter should have a dedicated team to review such reports in a timely fashion.”
The lawmakers are not alone in their concern. In a recent speech before the Council on Foreign Relations, CIA Director John Brennan warned that technology and social media have “greatly amplified” threats to national security.
“Twitter needs to do more. It’s time to put a stop to this cyber jihad,” says Mr. Poe.
“Twitter has systems in place to rectify copyright and trademark infringement. The least they can do is to have similar systems in place to address terrorism,” advises Mr. Sherman.
