People were asked about fake Obama news. This is how they answered.
For President Obama's appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" last week, people in downtown Hollywood were asked their thoughts on fake news events like Obama naming Dennis Rodman ambassador to North Korea and Vice President Biden making a "yo momma" joke to Russian President Vladamir Putin. "Nothing wrong with a little comedy," an Ohio man said with the usual earnestness. When asked his thought about Obama getting his ears pierced, another man said: "Hopefully he's not doing it for young voters, he's doing it for himself." So just a warning and a reminder: If you find yourself walking down Hollywood Boulevard and someone with a microphone and a camera asks you what you thought about news you haven't heard, it's probably best to walk away unless you want to find yourself on Kimmel's "Lie Witness News."
