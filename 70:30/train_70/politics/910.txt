Going to the Dogs at the White House
The Secret Service, embarrassed by recent lapses in guarding the president, is happily promoting two new heroes in a bid for some favorable publicity.
Their names are Hurricane and Jordan, and they are known among their colleagues for their work ethic, their physical prowess, their professionalism, and their bite.

Hurricane and Jordan are the dogs that were unleashed on a fence jumper at the White House Wednesday night, and they brilliantly accomplished their mission by stopping the intruder almost as soon as he landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service officials posted photos on Twitter Thursday of the two Belgian Malinois, each one sitting contentedly between American and Secret Service flags. Brief bios were included. Hurricane was described as a "black Belgian Malinois, brown eyes, age 6, enjoys playing with his Kong toy, ready to work." The Secret Service tweet also said Jordan is a "black/tan Belgian Malinois, brown eyes, age 5, enjoys walks around White House, ready to work."
The dogs were released by their handler as soon as the intruder made it over the fence, and they immediately attacked him. This gave Secret Service agents a chance to tackle and restrain the man.
The intruder, identified as Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Maryland, kicked Jordan in the nose and punched Hurricane repeatedly, the New York Times reported. The dogs were treated by a veterinarian, who said their injuries weren't serious. Adesanya, who was bitten by at least one of the dogs, was arrested and charged with several crimes, including illegally entering a restricted area and injuring animals used by law enforcement, according to the Washington Post.
The success of Jordan and Hurricane came a month after a man jumped the fence, ran across the lawn, entered the White House through an unlocked door, sprinted past a guard, and was finally stopped by other guards inside the building. In that incident, a handler didn't release the attack dogs because he apparently feared the animals would mistakenly attack security guards who were pursuing the jumper. The lapse was among several embarrassing incidents that led to the resignation of Secret Service director Julia Pierson.
But the canines gave Secret Service leaders and White House officials something to brag about. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest paid tribute to the attack dogs' reputation for ferocity. "I think that there's probably a good reason why these animals are kept somewhat removed from employees and others who frequent the grounds at the White House," Earnest told reporters, adding: "I think the [latest fence jumper] probably saw pretty vividly why we all keep our distance."
