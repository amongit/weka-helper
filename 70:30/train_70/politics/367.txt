Income Tax notice to Congress too on funding, Aam Aadmi Party has already received one
New Delhi: The Income Tax (IT) Department has issued notice to the Congress on political funding, sources said on Wednesday.
"We have received Income Tax notice on funding," said Congress sources.
Not only the Congress but the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also been served a similar notice by the IT Department. AAP, which registered a stunning victory in the Delhi Assembly elections on Tuesday, has been asked by the Department to explain donations of over Rs 2 crore to the party.
According to sources, the Income Tax notice has been served on the basis of issues raised by the Aam Aadmi Volunteer Action Manch (AVAM) which claimed AAP knowingly accepted funds from bogus firms.
The AVAM had alleged that several companies who claim to have given funds to AAP have also given funds to others. The AAP has to reply to the notice, which was served to them two days back, by February 16.
The concerned companies are also likely to be scrutinised. Notices by the I-T department are routine practices and are a matter of procedure.
