Obama Faces More Scrutiny on Iran Deal
President Barack Obama is having more trouble generating support for a controversial deal with Iran to limit Tehran's nuclear program.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declared his intention to have the Republican-controlled Congress take action on an accord, which could mean that many legislators, and perhaps a big majority, could vote to block it. "Apparently the administration is on the cusp of entering into a very bad deal with one of the worst regimes in the world that would allow them to continue to have their nuclear infrastructure," McConnell told CNN Sunday. "We're alarmed about it."

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said such a vote would have a "profoundly negative impact" on relations with Iran. The president has promised to veto such a measure, but it apparently would have considerable support even among Obama's fellow Democrats, and a veto could be overridden. Among the Democrats who support a vote on the deal are Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bill Nelson of Florida, according to Politico.
The problem for Obama in selling a deal is that so many legislators don't trust Iran to bargain in good faith or to live up to the commitments it makes.
Already, 47 Republican senators have sent a public letter to the Tehran government warning that any nuclear deal could be voided by the next president after Obama leaves office in January 2017. Obama advisers and allies denounced the letter as an intrusion on the executive branch's powers, and some Obama allies said it was an effort to torpedo the talks among the United States and its allies and Iran.
But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who organized Senate support for the public letter, told CBS his goal was to serve notice to Iran that Congress would insist on a review of a nuclear accord and that legislators would continue to take a tough line against Iran. "The Congress stands ready to impose much more severe sanctions" if Tehran moves forward in making nuclear weapons, he told CBS.

Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to resume talks with Iranian negotiators this week in Lausanne, Switzerland. The goal of the United States is to reach a deal by the end of March, although many sticking points remain, such as how much access Tehran would grant to inspectors monitoring its nuclear program and how much of its existing program would be dismantled.
