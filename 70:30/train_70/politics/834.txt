The Likability Factor
There will be many phases in the 2016 presidential race, including the contests for raising money, framing themes, recruiting strategists, building field organizations, and establishing credibility with the media. But one phase isn’t getting the attention it deserves: the likability test. And this could be the most important of all.
Likability isn’t the only factor in determining who wins the presidency. The candidates’ stands on issues, their experience and their records will make a big difference. But presidents play such a big part in our lives, and Americans are so enamored of positive personalities in public figures that being likable has become an indispensable quality for a candidate to have.

Ever since I started covering national presidential campaigns for U.S. News in 1988, the more likable candidate has won. It was Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012; Obama over John McCain in 2008; George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004; Bush over Al Gore in 2000; Bill Clinton over Bob Dole in 1996; Clinton over George H.W. Bush in 1992, and George H.W. Bush over Michael Dukakis in 1988. Before that, Ronald Reagan was more likable than Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Reagan won both times.
In the current cycle, even though it’s early, some potential candidates are already coming up short regarding the Likability Factor. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, is emerging as probably the least likable potential candidate of all. He is widely seen as a bully and an intimidator, whether that’s fair or not.
His tough-guy exterior was initially considered a plus by his fans. They billed it as evidence that he could effectively take on special interests and political adversaries at home and antagonists abroad. But Christie went too far. He has regularly gotten into dustups with reporters and citizens who challenge him, sometimes in a rude and dismissive way. He seems eternally strident. He is flunking the likability primary. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, another Republican, seems too diffident and retiring. This makes him appear bloodless, which runs counter to likability. He also faces a difficult problem in trying to deal with the baggage he carries as the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the brother of President George W. Bush. Dubya’s record is a particular problem because he remains so unpopular. Jeb Bush so far has not set forth his differences with his father and brother. He doesn’t want to seem disloyal but also says he is his own man. It’s a mine field, and his calculated approach so far hasn’t been very appealing.

Hillary Clinton, an ex-secretary of state, former Democratic senator from New York and former first lady, has problems in the likability department. Obama gave her a backhanded compliment during their battle for the 2008 Democratic nomination when he said she was “likable enough.” Yet in her current incarnation as an expected candidate and the Democratic front runner in the polls, she can appear remote and tone-deaf. She has allowed her family foundation to raise millions of dollars from foreign sources, raising conflict-of-interest questions. And this week she called again for pay equity for women even though a highly-publicized study by the Washington Free Beacon found that she paid women substantially less than men while she was in the Senate.
Unless she finds a more appealing approach, she may not be “likable enough” in 2016. A recent University of New Hampshire poll found that only 32 percent of voters in the first primary state say Clinton is the “most likable” Democratic candidate in the race. And while 58 percent of New Hampshire Democrats support her for the nomination, her trouble in the likability department is cause for concern among her backers. Adding to her potential problems, the media are starting to zero in on her efforts to refresh her image.
Most of the other candidates aren’t known well enough and haven’t sufficiently displayed their personas on the national stage for Americans to assess their likability. But some, like Christie, come across as too combative and always itching for a fight. Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also may fall into this pugnacious category.
In the end, likability counts, and candidates who ignore or downplay this factor do so at their peril.
