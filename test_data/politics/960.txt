'Cromnibus' Is a Big Win for the GOP
Not everyone realizes it yet, but the apparent success of the "cromnibus" legislative vehicle to fund most of the federal government through September 30, 2015 is a major victory for the conservatives who now make up the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party in Congress.
The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 – the formal designation for the combined continuing resolution and omnibus funding bill – maintains the Ryan-Murray spending caps of $521 billion for defense and $492 billion for non-defense spending. It also leaves the Department of Homeland Security as the only agency not funded through the end of the fiscal year. So unless President Barack Obama is willing to go to the mattresses over his plan to give 5 million illegal aliens temporary legal status, and many people are betting he isn’t, the legislation makes a government shutdown highly unlikely.

There’s some grumbling on the right, of course, but that is to be expected. It’s not a perfect vehicle and not, one hopes, what would have been put forward if there had been a Republican president in office ready to sign legislation sent up Pennsylvania Avenue by a Republican House and Senate. Nevertheless it is a strategic victory that strengthens the hand of the GOP, even at the expense of what are arguably tactical setbacks.
It includes no new funding for Obamacare. It prohibits the transfer or release of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba into the United States, meaning no civilian trials. It blocks funding of the risk corridors that, under the Affordable Care Act, could lead to a government bailout of the insurance companies. It maintains all the existing pro-life policy and funding provisions and adds three more while cutting the funds for the Independent Payment Advisory Board (which is the body that would be recommending any rationing of health care) by $10 million.
The bill also cuts funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by $60 million, which is the fifth consecutive year the agency’s budget has been cut and may finally convince the bureaucrats who run the place they cannot go beyond what they are legally authorized to do without congressional approval. And it hits the Internal Revenue Service particularly hard, cutting its allocation of federal dollars by $345.6 million, prohibiting it from targeting organizations because of the way they chose to exercise their First Amendment rights or on an ideological basis, punishes it for its profligate abuse of taxpayer dollars on expensive, needless videos and conferences at luxury resorts, and prohibits the White House from ordering the review of any organization's tax exempt status.

There’s more, but the general drift of the thing is toward smaller, leaner, more transparent, more honest government than has been the case over the last six years. The incentive for the Democrats in Congress to agree to all this – and for the president to sign it – is that a Republican House and Senate (led by Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell) are waiting in the wings to enact a much tougher bill if no long-term agreement can be reached by years’ end. The strategic brilliance that House Speaker John Boehner and others are showing here is reflected in the fact they’ve written a bill that doesn’t raise the stakes so high the president and his party have to oppose it. The Democrats may not be happy about many of the things in the bill but they can live with them, and that’s the difference.
The other piece of what turns out to be an exceptionally intricate puzzle is that by funding almost all of the government through the end of fiscal year 2015, the new Congress can focus on the spending plan for the following year. The new majority is free to turn its thoughts, focus and energy toward the future without having to split its time doing work that should already have been done. It opens the door to the creation of an agenda for spending (and for tax reform) that builds on where things are already headed under Ryan-Murray, albeit at the pace of a snail. Handled correctly, it presents the opportunity to develop a pro-growth agenda that has the interests of working Americans at its heart, the kind of thing a speaker named Boehner and a Senate majority leader named McConnell could hand to the Republican presidential nominee and say, “This is where we’re going. Why don’t you join us?”
