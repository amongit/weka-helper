Gaby Hoffmann Says Mel Gibson Screamed And Made Her Cry As A Child Actor (VIDEO)
Former child actress Gaby Hoffmann stopped by HuffPost Live earlier this week and revealed -- shocker -- Mel Gibson wasn't exactly the nicest guy to work with.
In 1993, then 11-year-old Hoffmann worked with Gibson on his directorial debut "The Man Without a Face," and she revealed that she doesn't exactly have good memories from it.
"I think I happened to work with sort of a bunch of slightly difficult male directors when I was a kid," she said. "I've since worked with lots of male directors that I love, so I no longer see the distinction gender-wise."
But, having a good relationship with the director makes all the difference, she explained. "You're either in it together, or you're not. And if you're not, it sucks," she said, adding that she didn't think director John Hughes, whom she worked with on the 1989 film "Uncle Buck," liked her very much.
"And the other one was Mel Gibson, and I think we can all agree that's going to be tough for anybody. He screamed at me. Oh, God, he really screamed at me. He just started cursing and screaming at me," she told HuffPost Live host Jacob Soboroff.
When asked why Gibson would behave that way toward her, the actress explained:
"I think I was acting like a kid instead of a professional actor. It happens once in a while when you're a kid actor."
Hoffmann, who is now 31 and starring in the upcoming movie "Crystal Fairy," also revealed that Gibson made her cry. And while she hasn't seen him since, she said if the two ever do cross paths again, she'd say, "I hope you're feeling better, Mel."
