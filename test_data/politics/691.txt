Teen Drinking Continues to Decline in the U.S.
Drinking underage and binge drinking have continued to decline in recent years, and have reached their lowest levels since data started to be collected in 1975, a new government survey shows.
The 2014 Monitoring the Future Survey, jointly released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the University of Michigan, used data from more than 41,000 students from 377 public and private schools throughout the U.S. It found alcohol consumption rates among eighth, 10th and 12th graders have continued their long-term decline, reporting past month use of 9, 23.5 and 37.4 percent respectively, compared to 10.2, 25.7, and 39.2 percent during 2013.

This also represents a significant drop from five years ago, when rates of alcohol use were 14.9 percent for eighth graders, 30.4 percent for 10th graders, and 43.5 percent for 12th graders.
There also was a significant drop in binge drinking – defined as five or more drinks in a row during the last two weeks – in 2014 among 12th graders, which is now under 20 percent. The most recent peak rate of binge drinking for seniors was in 1998 at 31.5 percent.
Dr. George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, says that one in five high school seniors reporting binge drinking during the past two weeks is still "unacceptably high," adding that underage drinking research should continue to be a priority.
Peer disapproval of binge drinking may play a role, according to the study. It has been rising since 2000 among teens, and in recent years there has been a decline in all three grades saying that alcohol is easy to get.

Other groups attributed the lower rates to government and private efforts.
“This is excellent news and underscores the effectiveness of public-private partnerships in producing real programs that have produced significant, tangible and historic results," Peter Cressy, president of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. "This is a societal problem that is trending in the right direction and it should be recognized. Key to this success is educating parents and other adults about the seriousness of providing alcohol to teens.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the misuse of alcohol is responsible for more than 4,300 underage youth deaths each year. In 2010, there were approximately 189,000 emergency rooms visits by persons under age 21 for injuries and other conditions linked to alcohol. Health professionals discourage the use of underage drinking because it contributes to slowing in brain development that can have life-long effects. It also can lead to violence, unwanted sexual activity, or unintentional injuries like car crashes or drowning.
