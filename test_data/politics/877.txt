Americans Favor New Cuba Policy
Americans are expressing strong support for President Barack Obama's new policy of normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba.
The latest poll by Zogby Analytics finds that 56 percent of likely voters favor the historic policy change and 27 percent oppose it, while 17 percent aren't sure.

Seventy-seven per cent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents favor the change, but only 32 per cent of Republicans agree with the shift.
Obama wants to improve relations with Cuba and force a congressional debate about lifting the trade embargo imposed more than 50 years ago when superpower tensions were high and relations with the communist-ruled island were at a low point. Obama intends to open a U.S. embassy there and ease some travel, business and other restrictions.

A spokesman for Gallup said Americans have backed normalization for years. In 2009, Gallup found that 60 percent of U.S. residents favored re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, which was "consistent with Americans' attitudes on this subject for an entire decade," the spokesman said. Also in 2009, a majority of Americans supported ending the trade embargo.
Obama said, "These 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach."
Many legislators support Obama's plan, which he intends to undertake by using his executive authority, bypassing Congress. But there is also strong opposition on Capitol Hill. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said the changes were "clearly intended to circumvent the intent and spirit of U.S.law and the U.S."
