Florida Suspends More Students Than Any Other State
A new state-level analysis shows American students are losing nearly 18 million days of instruction due to out-of-school suspensions. The study comes as education advocacy groups are increasingly critical of the ways schools discipline students, saying zero-tolerance policies disproportionately affect students of color, low-income students and those with disabilities.
The analysis, released Monday by UCLA's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, shows suspension rates are three to four times higher at the secondary level than at the elementary level, and that the racial gap in suspension rates also increased between elementary and secondary schools. Florida had the highest suspension rates at both the elementary and secondary levels, with 5.1 percent of elementary school students and 19 percent of secondary school students being suspended in the 2011-12 school year. In total, nearly 3.5 million students were suspended at least once during that school year.

"We conclude that our nation cannot close the achievement gap if our educators ignore the discipline gap," said Daniel Losen, directer of the center, in a statement. "Educators have an opportunity for serious and successful reform in this area and are legally and morally obligated to take action."
Delaware and Mississippi followed the Sunshine State in elementary school suspensions, with suspension rates of 4.9 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. The map below shows the elementary suspension rate for each state, as well as the gap between suspension rates for black and white students.
For secondary school suspensions, Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina each reported a suspension rate of 16 percent, the analysis found. The map below shows the secondary suspension rate for each state, as well as the gap between suspension rates for black and white students.
There were also noticeable disparities in suspension rates for students based on race, gender and disability status. In elementary school, the suspension rate for African-American students was 7.6 percent in 2011-12. In secondary school, it jumped to 23.2 percent. Students with disabilities were also more than three times as likely to be suspended at the secondary level.
Over time, the suspension rate for African-American students has continued to climb, from 6 percent in 1972-73, to 16 percent in 2011-12. Meanwhile, the suspension rate for white students has hovered between 3 and 5 percent. Although the racial gap between black and white students narrowed slightly between 2009-10 and 2011-12, the change was the result of a higher suspension rate for white students.
Missouri had the highest racial gap in elementary suspension rates: 14.3 percent of black students at the elementary level were suspended at least once, compared with 1.8 percent of white students. Wisconsin had the largest racial gap at the secondary level: 34 percent of black students were suspended at least once, compared with 4 percent of white students.
Still, an examination of suspension rates by school districts, rather than state averages, showed most were suspending a small fraction of students. At the elementary level, 58 percent of school districts suspended 2.5 percent or fewer black students, while just 14 percent suspended more than 10 percent of black students. Just 1 percent of elementary school districts suspended more than 10 percent of white students.
At the secondary level, 40 percent of schools were deemed "low-suspending" for black students, with a rate below 10 percent. Another 2 percent were "high-suspending," with rates above 50 percent. For white students, 80 percent of schools suspended fewer than 10 percent, and none had rates above 50 percent.

"However, the fact that 14 percent of districts suspended more than 1 in 10 black elementary students and 19 percent of the districts suspended at least 1 in 4 black secondary students is shocking when compared to the Latino and white distribution," the report says. "Because the distribution is so wide, we feel it is imperative that educators, parents, policymakers and civil rights advocates know which districts are high suspending and which ones are making improvements."
