Trey Gowdy On Hillary Emails: 'We Haven't Seen Any Evidence Of A Crime'
WASHINGTON -- “We haven’t seen any evidence of a crime,” Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chair of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said Sunday about Hillary Clinton’s private email use during her service as Secretary of State.
Gowdy was speaking to "Fox News Sunday" days after Clinton responded to a New York Times article alleging that she “may have violated federal requirements” under federal records laws.
Fox News’ Chris Wallace repeatedly asked Gowdy whether Clinton had broken any laws. The Benghazi committee chair declined each time to implicate Clinton.
Asked again by Wallace if Clinton had broken rules put in place by the Obama administration, Gowdy said, “I’m going to have to let smart lawyers decide if she complied with the law or not.”
Gowdy did declare that his investigation would continue and that the full House may ultimately have to vote on issuing a subpoena for the private email server Clinton maintained for the email account she used for both government and personal use. “We may be forced to go to court to see what is in those emails,” he said.
As to a timeframe on the investigation, Gowdy said, “When you litigate something you’re talking about years and years.
