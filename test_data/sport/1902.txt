Tennis Ball Boys Are Out, Long Live The Ball Dog
Tennis courts used to be the stomping grounds of stuffy, country-club types. Lately, though, the sport has gone to the dogs.
Three dogs, specifically: Oscar, a rescued bull mastiff; Ted, a border collie; and Super Teddy, a Jack Russell, Norfolk terrier, miniature schnauzer mix.

These pups took to the court earlier this month for an exhibition match between Venus Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova, working as "ball boys" in a promotion for the ASB Classic, which wrapped up last Saturday in New Zealand.

We can't speak to the quality of the players' game, but the ball boys dogs did an amazing job, if video footage (above) from the event is anything to go by.
