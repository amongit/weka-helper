Has the Commonwealth Games been s***, as Usain Bolt reckons? Send all your thoughts to

22.22 And it's good night from me, and it's good night from him. Good night.
And finally from the boxing hall England and World No1 Savannah Marshall - to the tune of Katy Perry - is through to the middleweight
beating Pearl Boraka of Botswana. Gloves off....
22.15 Just a few snippets from Gareth A Davies before we wrap up for the night.
Breaking news...history for Kiribati... first gold medal ever. Gold... !!!! Weightlifting.....105kgs category lift of 348 And it's David Katoatau from Nonouti Benjamin Watson of England took bronze.
From the boxing - Jai Opetaia, cousin of Tim Cahill, boxing for Aus - lost in the heavyweight division this morning. Does that mean with Anthony Fowler - cousin of Robbie Fowler - winning today it was a 1-0 victory for the Reds of Merseyside?
22.11 England have won gold, silver and bronze in the women's gymnastics alla-round. Claudia Fragapane gold, Ruby Harrold silver and Hannah Whelan bronze.
22.08 Fragapane goes last on the floor. England look like finishing one, two and three.
22.04 Harrold is awarded 13.7 for the floor. She leads with 55 points after finishing her four routines.
22.01 Ruby Harrold begins her floor routine.
22.00 BBC bottles it and switches over to BBC Two. Why not just put the News on BBC2?
21.55 Anthony Fowler speaks!

21.45 Gareth A Davies has been talking to Anthony Fowler
Quite funny after Fowler did his bit in the mixed zone ... On adrenalin he really does talk very very fast and group of journos shaking their heads at how long and hard they will have to listen to transcribe his comments ...

We will have audio of Anthony Fowler in the next few minutes.
21.43 The falls haven't done too much damage, Harrold is still first and Fragapane second with the floor to come.
21.35 Good 'flight and height' was the initial verdict but then she went off. Something to do with her shoulder.
21.35 She's fallen off as well.
21.34 England's Ruby Harrold is leading and takes to the beam.
21.31 This gymnastics is all very well and the BBC are revelling in it. I'm all for that. I must admit I haven't much of a clue about the scoring, though. I fear I don't have the right vocabulary either. "Fluid" and "fluent" seem to be the best terms of praise being used for the floor exercises.
21.25 Gareth A Davies reports
Running between weightlifting and boxing halls someone was practising Flower of Scotland on the bagpipes ... Strangely haunting. But you've gotta love this shizz...

21.17 In the women's gymnastics all-around England's Claudia Fragapane has fallen off the beam. She was second, but unlikely to stay there. Unless she butters the beam.
21.13 Gareth A Davies is back at the boxing, watching Anthony Fowler
Anthony Fowler is ahead after two rounds but not having everything his own way against Nickson Otiene Abaka. The Kenyan us powerful but Fowler's timing has been excellent here in Glasgow.
Fowler is able to counter cleverly from a high guard and in the third with damaging left hooks he has Abaka back-peddling and off balance. Fowler smiles in the closing seconds. Result not official here yet but he won all three rounds there. He's through to the semi-final.
21.09 The second semi-final of the 800m puts Nijel Amos of Botswana, Ronald Musagala from Uganda and Andre Olivier of South Africa through to the final. The first three qualifiers from the first race were David Rudisha (Ken) 1mins 46.61sec, 2 Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich (Ken) 1:46.88 and 3 Guy Learmonth (Sco) 1:47.78. Michael Rimmer, we think, is through as a fastest loser.
Just ran over to the weightlifting hall and it's great view from the press bleachers. One of the announcers over here sounds just like Sir Tom Jones. Love the fact that 4 members of the same family two sisters and two brothers lifting weights here for Samoa - Mary, Ele - both silvers - and Tovia and Petunu. Tovia still competing no medal for Petunu.
And Gareth kindly supplies images from behind the scenes at the boxing and the weightlifting.


20.58 The BBC coverage is all over the place as we watch David Rudisha wins his 800m semi-final. I've lost track of what's live and what isn't. This is something Andrew Such is perturbed about, too.
The coverage has been nothing but repeats, when there has been live events happening. I sat down tonight to watch the athletics, track and field, the high jump and long jump was on and all they did while all this was happening was to show repeats of earlier events. Gary Lineker should stick to football and crisps instead of trying to talk about athletics. I don't want to watch the last part of an event i want to see it live as they promised we won't miss a thing. That's rubbish; it was repeat after repeat. Why am I paying my licence fee?
20.49 We're playing catch-up but here's another gold for England. Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree have won the women's 3m Springboard in Edinburgh.
<noframe>Twitter: Andrew Smith - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23TeamEngland" target="_blank">#TeamEngland</a> put on the style to reach netball semis - it's been "braw"! <a href="http://t.co/zhFoyaVKyF" target="_blank">http://t.co/zhFoyaVKyF</a></noframe>
20.37 Kirani James gold in 44.24sec, Wade Van Niekirk silver, Lalonde Gordon bronze. Grenada's first gold at a Commonwealth Games.
20.32 Van Niekerk of South Africa took silver, leading after 300m but James outsprinted him up the home straight, Gordon of the two Ts bronze.
20.30 James wins in a new CG record. Rooney was fourth.
20.29 The men's 400m runners are about to take their blocks. Kirani James all the way, we expect.
20.28 Underrated Scottish songs


20.25 It's years since I heard Hermless, Simon. Thanks for that.

20.22 Greg Rutherford wins gold in the long-jump. Olympic champion for Great Britain and Commonwealth champ for England.
20.21 Good Lord. An email. Simon McMahon the merciful writes
Evening Rob. You want the best song ever written by a Scot? That's a bit like asking for your favourite song, film or child - it changes every day. How about I Can't Help Myself by Orange Juice, Mary's Prayer by Danny Wilson, Ain't That Enough by Teenage Fanclub, Right Down The Line by Gerry Rafferty, Hermless by Michael Marra. Take your pick.
Excellent choices (apart from Mary's Prayer, but I'll let you have it).
20.14 The heptathlon concludes with the 800m. Canada's Brianne Theisen-Eaton wins and takes gold, her compatriot Jessica Zelinka silver and Jessica Taylor of England takes bronze.
20.10 Gareth A Davies reports
(F Scott, I'm now calling him...) Fitzgerald was in a great fight with the Kiwi, and won by split decision. The lad from Preston guaranteed a bronze. Definitely a talent.
<noframe>Twitter: British Athletics - Not to be for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChrisBakerHJ" target="_blank">@ChrisBakerHJ</a> but a fabulous effort to finish 4th. He applauds the crowd. Great senior debut <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
20.00 Gareth A Davies is still ringside
England's Scott Fitzgerald, welterweight from Preston up here now in the boxing hall against New Zealander Bowyn. Has fantastic jab. Great timing. Lovely timing. Talks like Freddie Flintoff. Fights a lot better than him, though. Winner goes through to semis ... more to follow.
19.54 Here are some highlights of day seven so far


19.45 It's 1-2-3 for Kenya. Purity Kirui wins, Milcah Chemos Cheywa second, Joan Kipkemoi third. McColgan was sixth and Bamford seventh in a PB.
19.42 The three Australians are taking the Kenyans on. The six have split from the field by about 20m. Victoria Mitchell with her purple hair is dropping back.
19.39 Brendan Foster believes that McColgan is hampered by her water jump technique, not touching the barrier but leaping it and then losing her momentum.
19.38 Meanwhile at the high jump England's Chris Baker clears 2.25m at the second attempt to move up to fourth.
19.36 They are off and Kenya's three women hit the front.
19.33 Next up is the 3000m steeplechase with Elish McColgan and Lennie Waite of Scotland, England's Philippa Woolven and Northern Ireland's Kerry O'Flaherty, not forgetting England's Rachel Bamford racing the Kenyans.
19.28 Gareth A Davies is ringside
Double Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes of Northern Ireland through to the semi-final of the light flyweight competition. Such class. Boxes like a fighter from the professional code, switches between head and body beautifully. Stopped Charles Keama of Papua New Guinea in the third round. TKO victory.
19.25 Greg Rutherford regains the lead with a leap of 8.20m in the long jump.
19.20 Jack Laugher spins to win

<noframe>Twitter: British Athletics - Developments in round two of the men's long jump. South African Zarck Visser has joined <a href="http://www.twitter.com/GregJRutherford" target="_blank">@GregJRutherford</a> with a 8.12m jump <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
19.13 Jack Laugher wins by 45 points. Gold for England from Matt Mitcham with silver and Grant Nel bronze both for Australia.
19.11 Chris Mears of England moves into putative third.
19.08 Grant Nel is going for the reverse one and half somersaults with three and a half twists. He's currently third - he nails it with 75.60. Should be good enough for a medal.
19.05 I was ranting last night about the switching from BBC1 to BBC2. I won't bore you again. Anyway, back on One, we have had five rounds of the men's 1m springboard and England's Jack Laugher leads.
<noframe>Twitter: British Athletics - Great start for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/GregJRutherford" target="_blank">@GregJRutherford</a>. He lays down an early marker for the rest of the field with an 8.12m jump in round 1 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
18.40 At the diving, the men's 1m springboard, the standings after three rounds, Jack Laugher of England leads by 13 points from Grant Nel of Australia second and Matt Mitcham also of Oz third. Three dives to go.
18.15 Max Whitlock wants to take the challenge to four-time world all-around champion Kohei Uchimura after claiming the Commonwealth title with a near faultless performance in Glasgow on Wednesday.
It's an honour to be in the same sentence as that guy," Whitlock said.
"He's been an absolute idol for my whole gymnastics career and the guy I look up to. So I will be trying to push but I hit that 90 mark today and that's something that's a massive target of mine and hopefully I can keep pushing to get closer to 91.
"Since London 2012, all-around has been a massive target for me and to pull it off and for it to all come together on the day is great. It's a big marker experience-wise and confidence-wise as well. It gives me a massive push today. I'll be training really hard and hopefully I can get some new skills in there and that will be really good."

18.00 The three amigos

17.45 As you may have guessed, there isn't a great deal going on. But this evening we do have:
Athletics - men's 800m semis, 400m, high jump and long jump finals; the women's steeplechase, shot, javelin, and the finale of the heptathlon.
Boxing - quarters in the men's light-fly, welter and middle and the women's middle.
Diving - women 3m synchro final and men's 1m springboard
Gymnastics - women individual all-around.
Netball - Scotland v Norn Iron, Barbados v England
Weightlifting, wrestling, squash and whiff-whaff.
17.35 Hang on. Isn't this the best song written by a Scot?

Fair point. Rob.
17.20 Kurt Fearnley the wheelchair racer was in the boxing hall watching his colleague who defeated Natasha Jonas yesterday. Fearnley is the Commonwealth Games T54 1500m title holder and record holder - 3mins 08secs - and goes up against David Weir in the final tomorrow night. Fearnley is in great form he says and after Weir's dominance over four events in London, the standout Australian insists he will not give up the title lightly. Fearnley tried out the track in the heats and says the track is hard work as they go - and reminds him of London 2012. A good omen for Weir, perchance?

17.15 This is QI on Wales bidding to host in 2026 - Gold Coast City have 2018 and Edmonton or Durban are the remaining bidders for 2022.
Cardiff staged the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1958, when it was a smaller-scale event. The Welsh Government has yet to commit to a bid for the 2026 Games, which is the next edition it could look to stage, but CGF chief executive Mike Hooper confirmed talks are active.
"We welcome all our members to give serious consideration of future hosting of the Games," Hooper said. "I'm more than happy to openly acknowledge we've had discussions (with Wales) because they've been very open about that for quite some time, both with the CGA (Commonwealth Games Association) and indeed the minister of sport in Wales (John Griffiths).
There is a possibility of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport teaming up to stage the Games.
"I wouldn't rule out hosting a multi-city Commonwealth Games, it's not a new concept," Hooper said. "The distance would be far less in Wales compared to the set-up at Gold Coast in 2018 so it's a possibility, yes."
17.05 What's the greatest ever song written by a Scot? Is it this?

Yes, I'm right. It is. Unless, of course, you disagree.

16.45 Max Whitlock flies to gold

16.35 Gareth has a word from Nicola Adams: "I'm just sticking to the game plan and fighting smart. I don't know much about Amanda Bujold, I ll let the coaches do the analysis."
<noframe>Twitter: CommonwealthGamesENG - MEDAL: GOLD for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23TeamEngland" target="_blank">#TeamEngland</a> gymnasts <a href="http://www.twitter.com/maxwhitlock1" target="_blank">@maxwhitlock1</a> and BRONZE for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/NileMW" target="_blank">@NileMW</a> in The Men's All-Around Final <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
16.23 Gold for Max Whitlock, silver for Dan Keatings, bronze for Nile Wilson. England/Scotland/England.
16.20 Here comes Whitlock on the high bar amd he lands perfectly after a dazzling and precise routine. Surely that's gold for Whitlock?
16.17 The only error from Nile Wilson is the step backwards as he lands. Keatings still leads. Wilson has bronze. Max Whitlock is up next going for gold in the men's all-around.
16.16 Enough vegetables for a moment. In the men's gymnastics Scotland's Dan Keatings goes into the lead before Nile Wilson gets his go on the high bar.
Job done by Nicola Adams she leaves the ring. Easy as...

16.09 Round 3 easy as shelling ... Adams even switched to southpaw during that round and is too skilled for her Sri Lankan rival. Just needs to survive fourth round now and will face Mandy Bujold of Canada in the semi final on Friday.
Gareth's rocking the paisley and pea look for the summer.

16.07 Afternoon all, Rob Bagchi here. And straight up we have some more round-by-round from Gareth A Davies:
Lovely second round from Nicola Adams, knows how to pace the two minute rounds perfectly. Great flurry with 30 seconds remaining. Round 2 Adams 10-9.
16.01 After round one, here's GAD:
Nicola Adams floors Erandi De Silva at the end of the first round. Lovely stick and move from Adams until those last few seconds. 10-8 after one round.
15.56 Starting NOW in the boxing ring, reports Gareth A Davies:
Nicola Adams up now on BBC against Erandi De Silva in her quarter-final. Long, lean, Sri Lankan against the Olympic champion at flyweight.
15.45 It is all in the balance with just one discipline remaining. Whitlock, Keatings and Wilson are the current one-two-three. The high bar awaits. I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) is being shouted out in the background at the Hydro. Local boy Keatings slightly botched the bars, though.
15.27 England's husband-and-wife pairing Chris and Gabby Adcock, the top seeds in the mixed doubles badminton who received a first-round bye, have eased to a 21-12 21-13 win over Northern Ireland's Tony Murphy and Alannah Stephenson in the second round at the Emirates Arena.
They were on court for just 26 minutes and Gabby said: "It was about getting the job done today and saving as much energy as we can for the later matches.
"There are a lot of good pairs out there and being top seeds doesn't make a difference.
"We have just got to focus on ourselves. We're really enjoying playing here and not feeling too much pressure."
And, albeit with tongue in cheek, Gabby suggested her husband needed to raise his game, adding: "It is quite easy to switch off. Chris probably just switched off and needs to concentrate a bit more."
15.18 And it's the bars now, and Whitlock, who is two points ahead of Keatings, is in action now.

And it's a good one. "A dream championship, so far," says the commentator, with one discipline to go.
15.03 Here are the diving duo from before, Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch. They had to settle for silver after leading the pack until their final dive, after which Canada pipped them (PA).

14.59 14.333 is the score Scotland's Keatings manages on the vault, so Whitlock will stay in the front.

14.42 Whitlock is next.

He goes for a six difficulty, which is ballsy, given his position, but that shows his courage. It is good, though a little shaky on dismount. It's a 14.5.
14.39 It's the vault next, and Nile Wilson is at the end of the runway to kick us off. He gets 14.7, which is a bibg score, apparently. "That puts pressure on Keatings for the silver," says the commentator.
14.35 After three out of six of the Men's Individual All-Around Gymnastics, this is what is looks like:

14.22 I'm back after grabbing a bite, and Max Whitlock, a 21-year-old from Hemel Hempstead, is still leading the charge.
14.07 And over in the Hydro ...

With one GOLD at @Glasgow2014 already, @maxwhitlock1 is leading the Men's All-around Final #Gymnastics #TeamEngland pic.twitter.com/2yWpXzgeUA

14.05 Some s***gate news:

Usain Bolt leaves netball without chatting to assembled journos. Hardly surprising.Flying flag happily despite defeat pic.twitter.com/SmzrRvXTkB

And there is this, too:

14.03 And after England's Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch won women's synchronised 10-metre platform heading in to the last round, the latter has said this:
We were competing against silver and bronze medallists from the Worlds (in 2013 in Barcelona). We're really pleased to come second. We thought we might come fifth. We're really pleased with silver. We haven't been training the best this week. We went into competition and pulled it out the bag. The judges were a little bit low on our last dive.
13.52 There was also a great picture of David Millar before, and now we have a story to go with it ... some quotes have just dropped. The 37-year-old was controversially left out of the Garmin-Sharp team for the recent Tour de France but he has experienced the race many times and has only raced once for Scotland before.
He won gold and bronze medals in the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and he can help bring the curtain down on an eventful career in style when he defends his time-trial at Glasgow 2014.
It's going to be very special. It's kind of storybook in a way, especially after missing out on my last Tour de France, which was really important to me. This kind of makes up for it. I think this is actually going to be bigger. This is where my family are from, my earliest memories are from Glasgow, so to actually have one of my last races here is very special.
Who do you compete for again? David Millar shows his colours (PA)
13.43 This just in from Gareth A Davies:
Olympic bronze medallist Michael Conlan assured of a bronze medal here in Glasgow at bantamweight and he showed me his tattoo of chain and cross after one of the scrappiest bouts of his life. 'It felt like half a work out there,' he said and he'll box Welshman Sean McGoldrick in the semis on Friday.

Conlon defeated Nasir Bashir of Uganda; McGoldrick beat Ayabonga Sonjica of RSA, whose team mate in the stands did not stop shouting during the bout, concluded by split decision.

13.37 Nice socks: Scotland's Jayne Nisbet takes part in the Women's High Jump (PA).

13.30 And here is Usian Bolt showing that he is not having "a bit s***" time at the Netball:
Unhappy, moi? The world's quickest man horses around (PA)
13.27 Some pics for you now of today's action:
Leading: Canadian Melissa Bishop finished fastest in the 800m heats (GETTY)
13.16 And a nice yarn on the wires here.
Tony Murphy, a tennis coach from Northern Ireland, made his mark at the Commonwealth Games badminton tournament with a thrilling victory on Wednesday morning. The 24-year-old from Lisburn, who has swapped one racquet for another to compete in Glasgow, reached the men's singles third round with an energy-sapping 2-1 win over Pakistan's Muhammad Bhatti.
It's up there with one of the better wins and with this venue and the crowd, people that don't know you supporting you, shouting your name, it is a really good feeling. This is by far the biggest and best venue I have played in. I've lost a lot of matches like that this year so it's nice to actually pull one off when it matters the most.
13.12 Oh dear, sounds like someone had a little too much Buckie last night: a man has been detained by police after a disturbance at the Commonwealth Games athletes' village in Glasgow. Officers were called to the site in Dalmarnock in the east end of the city at about 6am on Wednesday. The 30-year-old is currently being held by police. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Around 6am on Wednesday police received a report of a disturbance. A 30-year-old man is currently detained."
13.06 And in case you missed the story of Usian Bolt allegedly speaking out about his disappointment, here it is.
13.02 A couple more people wading in on the s***gate debate. Two more for the *NOT S*** CAMP*:
Gordon Shepherd, Scotland women's hockey coach It is a phenomenal and truly fantastic city. He obviously hasn’t been out and it is hugely disrespectful to Glaswegians and also to the Scottish people. I’ve been out to the mountain biking and the Scotland crowd were cheering on a Ugandan rider. They have put on a fantastic show and I’m disappointed if anyone is saying that about Glasgow.
Susannah Townsend, England hockey player It’s a great city. I love the food, meeting lots of people, the architecture. Usain Bolt is is entitled to his own opinion. Glasgow have done it really well.
13.00 And Ben Bloom has been speaking with Dai Greene, who flunked his 400m hurdles heat earlier today.
Former world champion Dai Greene is convinced his Welsh team-mates Rhys Williams and Gareth Warburton did not “deliberately cheat” after they were kicked out of the Commonwealth Games for failed drugs tests.The 400m hurdler Williams and 800m runner Warburton were both banned from competing in Glasgow after testing positive in the build-up to the Games. “When Gaz found out he texted me and I was really upset about it because I know Gaz and lived with him for a few years. He’s not that kind of guy,” said Greene. “Hopefully they can get to the bottom of things and find things out because I do believe that they are not deliberate cheaters. They have probably just been careless or misled slightly. That will come eventually I’m sure."
12.56 This just in from Gareth A Davies, it's the boxing highlights for later today: Nicola Adams, women's flyweight, quarter final 3.45pm; Paddy Barnes, light flyweight, quarter-final 7pm; Anthony Fowler, middleweight, quarter-final, 9pm; Savannah Marshall, women's middle, quarter final, 10.15pm.
12.52 Oh no! Couch and Barrow muck up their last dive and win silver, with Canada winning. The rather excitable Leon Taylor made a fool of himself. "Wow. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and say England have won gold," he said. The judges didn't agree, though, and there was an agonising wait as they had to write their verdicts:

And here are the final standings:

It's the 34th silver medal for England in this year's Commonwealth Games.
12.43 Couch and Barrow perform their fourth dive. "You could drive a bus through that," says Leon Taylor. Here they are looking nervous:

But they don't need to worry; one dive to go ...

12.40 Meanwhile, here is Tom Cary ... and he has sent over a pic, too:

Bolt-watch latest.. The Daily Mail's man was briefly ejected for trying to sit next to the speedster, having his credentials forcibly removed for a time, but has managed to get back into the arena!
12.35 And in their third (out of five) they don't get decent marks. Sevens. But the judges are being quite tight, it seems. They are still in the lead still, just about:

12.30 Couch and Barrow perform their second dive. "Hello team England," says Leon Taylor.

They are top after two rounds:

12.28 It was an issue with the judges recording their verdicts, it seems (they need to lift paddles to register their scores). So after round one the English are third. That was the obligatory dive, though, and there is another one to go that they must do.
12.20 Aha, now they are ready. Not sure what the trouble was there ...
12.15 I've just switched over to the diving venue, to see if England's Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow will succeed in the 10m Platform Syncho, but there is a technical delay, and the commentators are none the wiser. They have no clue as to why proceedings have been halted. And they are struggling to fill the gaps. "It's about reading body language," says one. And now, amusingly, they have stopped trying altogether.
12.10 Looks like another Jamaica is feeling the cold. Here is discus thrower Chad Wright and his ace socks:

12.03 Meanwhile Tom Cary has spied Usain Bolt:
A day after allegedly describing the Commies as 's***', Usain Bolt has been spotted at the netball, cheering on Jamaica against New Zealand. It remains to be seen whether he will be leading the Mexican Wave.
According to the wires: "Taking up a regular seat towards the back of the VIP section, the crowd did appear immediately aware of his presence as he sat quietly chewing gum and clapping his team."
12.02 Both the Brits are through: it's Meadows and then Sharp. Good 800m running by those two. Very controlled from them.

12.01 Now on the track it's the Women's 800m. And England's Jenny Meadows, who is looking really suntanned from her training camp in Portugal, will run in this one. As will local lassie Lyndsey Sharp, whose dad ran for Scotland.

12.00 More on s***gate (as it's inevitably been labelled): The Times reporter behind the story, Katie Gibbons, has stated on Twitter that the "full conversation" with Usain Bolt would feature in Thursday's newspaper.
11.54 Here is Greene:
I knew that I was playing catch up from a few months ago. I did want to make the final but I ran out of steam. I didn't have the legs to carry me home in the home straight. I'm just not fit enough. Sadly it's not to be. I don't think I'll go to the European Champions [in Zurich] now.
Englishman Richard Yates will play in the final, after a good run in that heat. But the winner was Roxroy Cato of Jamaica. What a name. The list for the final, which will take place tomorrow, will be as follows:

11.52 Oh no, he's not got it at all Greene. He was WAY out of it. He ended fifth, I think. That lack of preparation this season has counted.

11.50 Dai Greene, the Commonwealth Games champion in the 400m hurdles, is up in his heat now. The Welshman is also the 2011 World Champion, of course. He has not had a good season; it's been rather stop-start thanks to injury. In fact, since 2010 he has had three hernia operations.

11.45 So, the big question on Usain Bolt's everyone's lips today: has Glasgow 2014 been "a bit s***"?
Here is what some sports folk think:
*BIT S*** CAMP*
Jason Livermore, Jamaica Usain is somewhere in the village. I hope he's having a better time than me [after finishing sixth in 100m final]. The people in Scotland are very welcoming so I can't complain. There's a nice atmosphere and a nice crowd so I'm enjoying myself. The food? Ooof. I can’t say anything about that. Have I tried Irn Bru? No. It's very cold. Back in Jamaica it's not like this. I need to get me some clothes. It's freezing.
*NOT S*** CAMP*
Chad Le Clos, South Africa Obviously the prestige is different at these games. London was the best, no doubt about that. But this has definitely been up there for me. For someone from South Africa it’s a big thing to win a gold medal in the Commonwealths. Particularly in swimming where you are up against great competition, it is one that matters. And Glasgow has been brilliant. The atmosphere in the pool was crazy.
Gavin Smellie, Canada The weather is a little bit colder than we are used to but other than that it is great. The food could be a little bit better though. What could they do to improve it? You can’t go wrong with salmon, so they should have more salmon. Some things some times are under-cooked but other than that it’s fine. You have to just get used to different food but that’s the Commonwealth experience. The crowd and atmosphere have been great. I love it.
Rasheed Dwyer, Jamaica It’s very comfortable in the athlete’s village. The people are very friendly so it’s been nice. Usain is a friendly guy so I see him around and the Jamaica camp is a very nice camp. I’m having a good time here. I haven’t seen any sights yet but hopefully when I finish I can go out and experience the town. The food? You have a variety of food so you can choose from all sorts of things. I’m happy with it.
Antoine Adams, St Kitts and Nevis Other than the weather, which is up and down, it has been great. The people are great, the village is fun so I’m having a good time so far. I’ve been playing video games, playing pool, just chilling – there’s lots of stuff to keep busy. The food is ok. I’ve been eating a lot of burgers recently so I need to cut back on that. I can’t speak for Usain, but I am having fun here and it’s been a great experience.
11.35 Really disappointing from Niall Flannery, England's 2014 British 400m hurdles champion. In his heat he came fourth.
"It's probably not enough," he says. "I'm not sure what happened."
11.30 Oh no. It seems another Jamaican is not happy in Glasgow. Usain Bolt's Jamaican sprint team-mate Jason Livermore was asked if the world's fastest man was having an okay time, and said: "I hope so, better than me."
Has no one told them that they need to be positive at all times, or else?
Asked how he was coping with the food in the village, Livermore said: "Ooof, sometimes."
Pressed for more details, he said: "I can say, I won't say."
Livermore looked to be feeling the cold ahead of his 200m heat this morning and said: "It's very cold here, I need to put on some clothes, I'm freezing."
Fair enough, I guess, if you hail from the Caribbean!
11.17 There seems to be a lot of England v Scotland action today. Well the satires will be flying after this battle:
<noframe>Twitter: CommonwealthGamesENG - RESULT - WRESTLING: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/GeorgeRamm1" target="_blank">@GeorgeRamm1</a> loses 4 - 1 to Viorel Etko of Scotland in the men's freestyle 61kg quarter-final <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23TeamEngland" target="_blank">#TeamEngland</a></noframe>
And after England won the hockey earlier on Rod Gimour enjoyed that one:
<noframe>Twitter: Rod Gilmour - Riveting contest. England attack had purpose. Defence and Hinch brilliant as Scotland pressed and pressed. Scots deserved something.</noframe>
11.10 Good news Lawn Bowls fans:

11.05 And Bolt's countryman Yona Knight-Wisdom is, ahem, causing a splash in the diving competition. Look at these snazzy trunks!

11.00 And now Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, has waded into the Bolt debacle.
Speaking at the daily media briefing, Hooper he said he would take Bolt "at his word" following his denial.
Asked initially about Bolt's reported comments, Hooper said: "I think if you are up to speed you'll know Mr Bolt has put out a Twitter comment."
Hooper added: "We take Mr Bolt at his word.
"We're very pleased with how he's responded and that's our position."
Referring back to Bolt's weekend press conference, Hooper said: "He's very upbeat, very positive, very focused on delivering for his fellow countrymen in the relay events.
"He has said what he's said and I don't wish to comment on the journalistic work of The Times."
He added:
We're not trying to be the Olympic Games. We're about the celebration of the Commonwealth, sport and culture within the Commonwealth, and what a fantastic event we are seeing here in Glasgow. These Games continue to go from strength to strength. We are who we are and proud of it.
10.55 Asked on Saturday what he expected from Glasgow, Bolt said: "A lot of rain maybe, seeing a lot of kilts around the place. I didn't come here with expectations, I'm just coming out and trying to see the country. I guess they will try to show me their culture.
"I always stay in the athletes' village, it's always fun to be among the athletes, it makes you relax more.
"I try not to walk around the village too much because I tend to take a lot of pictures. I will stay in my room most of the time."
10.48 And now Bolt's manager Ricky Simms, in a face-saving exercise, has said that the remarks attributed to the athlete were "utter rubbish" (not utter s***?).
The atmosphere in and around the stadiums has been absolutely fantastic and I have absolutely no idea where these quotes have come from.
10.45 Rod Gilmour's hockey report is in:
As much as a lone bagpiper in the crowd and Glasgow's beastly easterly wind tried, England women edged into the Commonwealth Games semi-finals after a quite enthralling pool encounter at Glasgow Green.
First half strikes from Alex Danson and Susannah Townsend proved enough before Nikki Kidd's incisive penalty corner set up a nervy last 35 minutes, of which Scotland had the lion's share of possession but just couldn't convert. At the end, the Scots sunk to their knees, while England breathed a heavy sigh ofn relief. Defeat was unthinkable.
10.35 The BBC have zoomed over to Hampden Park, where the athletics is taking place, and Denise Lewis is one stylish lady:

The highlights this morning on the track include the Men's 200m heats, featuring favourite Warren Weir, the 24-year-old Jamaican who won bronze at the Olympics two years ago. A little later on Welshman Dai Greene (who once scored a penalty against Real Madrid) will be going in the 400m hurdles heats, too.
Here is what happened two years ago (wait for Usain's press ups at the end):

10.30 It's all over in the Women's Hockey: England have defeated Scotland 2-1 and will take their place in the Commonwealth Games semi-final, where they will face New Zealand. Wonder what Rio thinks (he has not tweeted yet).
10.25 So we know that Usain Bolt wakes up at about 10am ...
<noframe>Twitter: Usain St. Leo Bolt - I'm waking up to this nonsense..journalist please don't create lies to make headlines</noframe>
The Jamaican sprint superstar denies calling the Commonwealth Games "a bit s***", then.
Bolt was reported in The Times to have made the remark outside the athletes' village on Tuesday, also replying "not really" when asked if he was having fun in Glasgow.
10.15 In the hockey there is just over 10 minutes left for Scotland to score. They need two goals. The Wild Rover plays forlornly on the bagpipes in the background, a bit like this:

10.05 Take cover: the Usain Bolt comments (the Commonwealth Games are "a bit s***", apparently) are causing a Twitter storm!! And this has just landed:
<noframe>Twitter: Chris McLaughlin - .<a href="http://www.twitter.com/usainbolt" target="_blank">@usainbolt</a>'s manager tells BBC sport reports linking the sprinter to disparaging commitments about <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a> are 'utter rubbish.'</noframe>
And it seems hockey has a fan in Queens Park Rangers' Rio Ferdinand:
<noframe>Twitter: Rio Ferdinand - Susana Townsend with the cheeky dink 2-0 to England! I'm into this hockey. I wish our refs communicated like these hockey refs!</noframe>
Though even he is a bad mood on Twitter:
<noframe>Twitter: Rio Ferdinand - "<a href="http://www.twitter.com/steve3011" target="_blank">@steve3011</a>: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rioferdy5" target="_blank">@rioferdy5</a> hockey players show respect to the refs <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23simples" target="_blank">#simples</a>" &#62; don't lie, I saw some back chat..but with please &amp; thank you's!</noframe>
10.00 The second half has begun in the hockey, by the way, and it's still currently 2-1 to England. Remember: to advance England need to at least draw and Scotland require a victory. Hoots mon! And just as I tap these words Alex Danson almost takes her game tally to two goals after dispossessing a Scottish defender. Her lofted shot goes about three inches over. Ooof!
And the play races to the other end and Scotland have a penalty corner now. Edge-of-your-seat stuff! Good save from England stopper Maddie Hinch. You could call it Hinch perfect. (Sorry.)
Meanwhile, here's an amusing picture of someone making a spelling mistake.

You had one job. pic.twitter.com/8BTTGuaSDr

09.50 Here is a look at the medal table, by the way:
Australia 34 31 36 101
England 33 33 27 93
Canada 16 5 18 39
Scotland 13 11 13 37
And here is the rest of the list.
09.45 A decent first half comes to an end. Hockey is the winner.

09.40 And Scotland have hit back through their own short corner, and it's Nikki Kidd. Cracking first half: three minutes of the first-half to go, and it's 2-1 to to England. Here's a blurry shot of the goal (Kidd is at the back).

09.35 And it's 2-0 to England Women in the hockey now, after they were awarded a contentious penalty corner. It looked like it came off an English, not Scotland leg. Regardless the umpire (there is one in each half: who knew?), after a question upstairs, gives it. Susannah Townsend hammers in the goal after a neatly worked set-piece. Townsend is the one to the left with her stick up.

09.30 Scotland had a good chance to level, with some brilliant build-up play, but the lassie at the far post couldn't knock it in, alas. Just under 10 left of the half.
Meanwhile there is a little Scottish-English rivalry off the pitch. BBC's Gary Lineker is in a Twitter spat ... Like the way that Jane Merrick offers a fiver for a non-existant hyperthetical bet; times must be tougher than we thought at The Independent.

09.20 England have started well in the game, and have had the lion's share of possession, and Alex Danson has just scored the first goal of the game, lifting the ball neatly over the onrushing goalkeeper. Here's how she did it:

And here is the attacker celebrating with her team:

09.15 I've some Hockey action for you first up, and it's a Home Nation clash in the women's competition. It's England-Scotland, and with 21 minutes left in the first half it's 0-0. England need to draw to advance; Scotland require a win.

09.00 And here is some other required reading for you.
Gillian Reynolds is not enjoying the coverage of the Games, and rants about it here.
I am completely and totally fed up with the Commonwealth Games on BBC Radio 5 Live ... It may be marvellously brilliant, if you’re there in Glasgow. If you’re at home, changing the beds, boiling the kettle, they all sound like kids who’ve eaten too much sugar.
What do you think? Let us know.
And it seems that Usain Bolt is not happy, either. This story has just landed: According to The Times, a grumpy-looking Bolt left the athlete's village before claiming "the Olympics were better", he was "not really" having fun in Scotland and that the games themselves were "a bit sh*t".
You can imagine the world's quickest-ever man sitting in a car, with the rain teeming down ... Poor Usain. We will see him in action on Friday, by the way, in the 4x100 metres. And this after he met Prince Harry, too ...

08.45 Before we dive in, how about this for some light entertainment: a gallery of the best gurners of the Commonwealth Games. This one is my fave:
