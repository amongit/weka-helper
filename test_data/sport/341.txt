The 5,000-seater venue was built in just 13 months and will be easily distinguishable to Olympic Park visitors by its silver-coloured wrap and inflatable roof, made from recyclable plastic.
Both men's and women's water polo competitions will be held at the arena during the Olympics but it will only be a temporary venue. After the Games it will be taken down with elements reused in other parts of the UK.
The venue is located at the main eastern entrance of the Olympic Park opposite the Aquatics Centre and will hold almost three million litres of water in the warm-up and competition pools.
Seb Coe, the chairman of the London organising committee, said the venue was fit for staging "epic" water polo matches during the Games.
"The Water Polo Arena will be a great stage for epic Olympic medal battles in this fast and tough sport this summer," he said.
