Floyd Mayweather fight could happen in a year - Amir Khan
Great Britain's WBA light-welterweight champion Amir Khan says he wants to move on to "bigger and better fights" following his fifth-round stoppage of IBF champion Zab Judah.
The 24-year-old is delighted with his all-round performance in Las Vegas, claiming his "speed and power" were too much for the US veteran.
Khan believes he could fight American legend Floyd Mayweather with in the next twelve months, and insists he is now "one of the most exciting boxers in the world".
