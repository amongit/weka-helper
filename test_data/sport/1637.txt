Devon Still Shares Some Good News About His Daughter's Cancer Treatment
Cincinnati Bengals player Devon Still shared some good news about his daughter Leah, who has been battling cancer since being diagnosed last June.
Still posted on Instagram Tuesday that doctors don't see any "active disease" in his four-year-old daughter's body after early rounds of testing were completed this week. He noted that further MRI and bone biopsy results are to come later in the week.
That moment you get the best news you've ever received and don't know what to do so you just flex!! We got Leah's MIBG Scans back tonight and the doctors told us they didn't see any active disease in her body!!! We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week. But the doctors feel very optimistic about them because of the results from today. So for now we celebrate!! #LeahStrong #PrayersWork #ThankYouEveryOne #ImSoHappyIFeelNumb #BeatCancer

Support for Still and his daughter poured in last year as their story made headlines. Originally cut from the team, the Bengals added Still to the roster, so he could continue to receive health insurance to cover the cost of Leah's treatment. And proceeds for Still's jersey sales raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for pediatric cancer research.

Throughout Leah's fight, Still has been posting updates to Instagram, including a pep talk the pair shared before Leah went in for treatment.

As for Still's future in the NFL, as an unrestricted free agent he is still weighing a one-year option from Cincinnati, according to ESPN.
