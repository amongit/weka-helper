Chelsea confident Cesc Fabregas will be fit to face West Brom despite withdrawing from Spain squad

Chelsea are confident Cesc Fabregas will be fit to face West Bromwich Albion next Saturday, even though the midfielder has been forced to withdraw from the Spain squad.
Midfielder Fabregas was ruled out of Spain’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus and next week’s friendly against Germany after complaining of pain in his hamstring.
Scans showed there was no tear or serious damage and Chelsea are hopeful that, with rest and recuperation, 27-year-old Fabregas will be available to face West Brom if selected.
Chelsea travel to Schalke in the Champions League three days after the West Brom game, when manager Jose Mourinho will also want Fabregas at his disposal.
Fabregas played the entire 90 minutes of Chelsea’s games against Liverpool and Maribor last week, with Mourinho admitting he had taken a gamble over the player’s fitness.

On Fabregas, Spain head coach Vicente del Bosque said: “His muscle seems all right, but he complains and he is the best doctor. When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him.”
The withdrawal of Fabregas and striker Diego Costa, who has been given time off to rest his groin and hamstring, has caused much debate in Spain.
Mourinho hit out at Del Bosque and the Spanish Federation over the condition in which Costa returned to Chelsea after the last international break.
In order to help stop further rows or accusations that managers are pulling their stars out of the squad, the Spanish Federation will now demand a medical report from injury-hit international players and have their injuries confirmed by national team doctors before they can be formally granted leave.
The Spanish have also lobbied Uefa and Fifa for greater support to ensure clubs do not put pressure on their players who have been called up for international duty.
