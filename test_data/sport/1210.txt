Man City captain Vincent Kompany's dressing-room row with team-mate threatens to derail sorry campaign

With Manchester City trailing league leaders Chelsea by three points, on the brink of Champions League exit and out of the FA Cup, the Premier League champions' season is unravelling at an astonishing pace and reports claiming that Vincent Kompany was involved in a dressing-room row with team-mates will go little way to allay fans' fears that Manuel Pellegrini's side are in freefall.
Following their disappointing 2-1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield earlier this month when captain Kompany was culpable for Jordan Henderson's opening goal, a source close to the club has claimed that the Belgian almost came to blows with team-mate Fernandinho.
Kompany, an integral part of City's defence since he arrived at the club for £6 million from Hamburg in 2008, has endured a poor season and it appears that his frustrations may have surfaced in the changing rooms at Anfield when he reportedly verbally attacked Fernandinho after the Brazilian had questioned his form.
Reports claim that during the altercation manager Pellegrini was forced to step between the pair demanding that Kompany calm down.
However, despite the claims a City spokesman told Telegraph Sport that the suggestion Kompany was dropped because of the altercation was "not true".
Kompany was benched by Pellegrini for City's following game – their 2-0 win at home to Leicester City – where he remained an unused subsititute while Fernandinho was dropped from the squad.
