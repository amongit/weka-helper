Simona de Silvestro hoping to land more races for Andretti
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Simona de Silvestro will test her new ride for Andretti Autosport next week at Sebring International Raceway in Florida.
De Silvestro gives the team a fourth driver in the opening race March 29 at St. Petersburg, Florida. She's hoping it turns into a full-time ride.
She came to Barber Motorsports Park on Monday while other drivers tested to help get to know her new team better. She says the deal happened too late to get ready to ride in Birmingham, but de Silvestro will test next Monday and Tuesday.
De Silvestro says she first called team owner Michael Andretti in November. but he didn't have any openings. De Silvestro says she's missed racing ''so it's going to be exciting to get back behind a wheel. ''
