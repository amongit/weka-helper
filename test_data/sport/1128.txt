Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle braved the monster wave, at Praia do Norte, Nazaré, Portugal.
The wave, which is estimated to have been 100ft high, could be the biggest wave ever ridden.
The enormous waves were caused by the severe Atlantic storms which have hit Europe, killing 11 people.
Mr Burle was with fellow surfer Maya Gabeira, also from Brazil, who was knocked unconscious by the strong waves and nearly drowned.
The surfers were taking part in the Billabong XXL surfing competition. This particular ride is an entry in the Ride of the Year category.
