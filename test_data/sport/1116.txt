Video has emerged of surfers riding the Severn bore in Gloucestershire despite the icy temperatures.
In the footage surfers can be seen running from cars and getting into the water in front of gathered crowds - before riding the wave for several metres along the River Severn.
The filmer later wrote online: "Rolling through the Gloucestershire countryside this morning, the 5 star Severn Rore, reached a height of 10.1 metres", calling it the "largest Severn Bore of the year".

The surge wave, which ranges from one-star up to five-stars, is caused by the incoming tide being funnelled up the narrowing Severn Estuary.

The phenomenon takes place around 12 times a year usually during the spring and autumn equinox, when a wave is formed every morning for two or three days.
