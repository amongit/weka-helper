High School Football Star Proves Friendship Is More Important Than Scoring A Touchdown
Senior football star Bryce Kemp might have made the best move of his high school career by purposely avoiding the end zone.
The athlete at Collins-Maxwell/Baxter High School in Iowa sprinted into the clear but mysteriously slid at the one-yard line on a punt return in the final regular season game last Friday. But his intent soon became clear, Iowa station KCCI reported: He wanted his childhood friend, offensive lineman Clayton Weltha, to have one last shot at scoring his first touchdown.
So with little time remaining in a blowout victory over Centerville, Weltha took his gift from Kemp and ran with it -- right into the end zone on the next play.
“That touchdown was the greatest feeling in my life,” Weltha told the Ames Tribune. “That was the first touchdown I ever (scored). I’d like to thank Bryce Kemp for taking that awesome knee. "
The team had another milestone to celebrate as well: Collins-Maxwell/Baxter finished the regular season undefeated for the first time in school history, the Newton Daily News reported. Well done, guys.
