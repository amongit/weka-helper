Laying on fan festivals for the United States' World Cup games is proving something of a problem in Chicago. In the past, the tricky thing may have been attracting supporters to come and spend their hard-earned dollars on foam fingers and cups of beer: now, it is trying to keep people out.
Last Sunday, fans began filing into Grant Park at 10:30am for a 5pm kick-off, with people sprinting to get to the best spots. Long before kick-off, supporters were being turned away, with the venue full to its 15,000 capacity. Even more are expected on Thursday for the group decider with Germany. "Soccer is growing exponentially - every time the World Cup happens, it gets bigger. We have a good problem on our hands," said Sinhue Mendoza, a spokesman for US Soccer.
The raucous scenes in Chicago - which saw fans break down crush barriers after the United States' two goals and collapse in paroxysms of despair at an injury-time equaliser - have been indicative of an explosion of interest in all things Brazil 2014. The Portugal game pulled in 20 million viewers on Sunday, with another 1.4m watching online on ESPN - figures which exceed the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup finals and are comparable with the NBA finals.
Thousands more have flown to Brazil to watch Jürgen Klinsmann's side in the flesh, with no visiting country being allocated more than USA's 125,000 tickets. The soundtrack to their matches has been the chant devised by the American Outlaws supporters’ group: “I believe that we will win.” It helps explain the team's impressive progress in Brazil, which sees them needing just a point on Thursday to progress to the knockout phase.

“When we are standing on the field in Natal, and the entire stadium is singing the national anthem, you get goose bumps,” midfielder Michael Bradley said, after the Portugal game.
America's football obsession may be reaching new heights, but it is not entirely new. The 1994 World Cup remains the best-attended tournament Fifa has hosted, with an average of 69,000 fans packing monolithic stadiums from Los Angeles to New York. The country's voracious appetite is writ large by NBC Sports paying $250 million in 2013 for three years of Premier League rights, and Fox scooping up coverage of the Bundesliga. Bidding wars for the Champions League and World Cup now involve multiple companies, with the incumbents forced to offer more money and promises of promotion each time.
The seemingly unlimited infrastructure that allows media companies to spend that kind of cash on television rights and ensures facilities can be built in the snap of a finger is now slowly being turned on player development, so the team on the field can also compete, although in the meantime Klinsmann has been busy recruiting players from America's diaspora, with seven players holding dual citizenship.
Yet the flourishing of the national side has not been mirrored in Major League Soccer, which still struggles for exposure. Its vague and meandering off-field rules make its appeal more difficult to grasp than European leagues. The salary cap and college draft that work so well in the NFL and NBA do not have the same power in a truly global game.
The league’s single-entity structure — meaning MLS owns all contracts and sells rights to create “franchises” in different cities, expanding to 24 teams by 2020 — and regulations limit spending and ensure no one team is disproportionally talented.
“When the European players come here, they all tell me it's a difficult league with travel and how physical the league has gotten,” ESPN colour commentator and former MLS player Taylor Twellman said from Brazil. “The expansion has slowed the quality of depth on rosters, but in due time, it will only make the league better.”
Television ratings for the MLS Cup final in 2013 nearly matched the all-time low set in 2010, and yet a preseason friendly in August between Real Madrid and Manchester United sold out a 110,000-seat stadium half an hour after tickets went on public sale in early April. Clearly, football fans exist in the US. MLS just hasn’t been able to tap their full potential yet.
For now, supporters will rush to their local bars, skipping work or taking extended midday breaks, to watch the Americans take on Germany. And Chicago's city officials might need to find a bigger park.
