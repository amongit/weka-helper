Zenit signed Hulk from Porto in September 2012 for £43m

Torpedo Moscow will play two home matches behind closed doors after fans chanted racist abuse at Zenit St Petersburg's Hulk on Sunday.
The Brazilian, 28, scored the only goal for leaders Zenit in the 1-1 draw in the Russian league match at Torpedo.
A Russian Football Union spokesman said: "If there's a repeat there will be even stronger punishment next time."
Zenit and former Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas had earlier called the abuse "a disgrace to football".
Torpedo had part of their ground closed in September after fans racially abused Dynamo Moscow's Christopher Samba.
The club's fans were also found guilty in November of aiming chants at Rostov's black players which resulted in the club having part of their stadium closed again for three matches.
Torpedo were also hit with a £3,300 fine after the latest incident.
