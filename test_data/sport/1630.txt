Matt Stonie Drinks 7 Shamrock Shakes In Minutes, Earns Our McRespect
We're guessing he didn't want fries with that.
Watch competitive eating star Matt "Megatoad" Stonie drink seven large McDonald's Shamrock Shakes in 4 minutes 41 seconds.
According to Stonie's math, that's about 1 1/4 gallons packed with 5,740 calories and 805 grams of sugar.
During the "7 Shamrock Shake Challenge" attempt, Stonie pours the green concoctions into two jars, adding whipped cream and maraschino cherries. He then chugs away while wrestling with massive brain freeze.
Incidentally he chases the feat with a cheeseburger. What a showoff.
Stonie recently set a world record by eating 182 slices of bacon in five minutes. A week earlier, he consumed 14.5 pounds of birthday cake.
According to Major League Eating's website, the 120-pound Stonie shares the same San Jose, California, hometown as hot dog eating champ Joey Chestnut.
Imagine those two eating at McDonald's together, if you dare.
