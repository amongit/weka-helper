Roberto Mancini and Joe Hart in dressing-room bust-up after Manchester City's wall malfunction against United

Mancini, whose authoritarian approach is becoming an increasing source of irritation with his senior players, criticised Hart for failing to insist that Carlos Tévez acted as a fourth member of the wall.
Van Persie ultimately took advantage of the shambolic nature of City’s three-man wall by curling his free kick into the far post and beyond Hart’s stretched right hand.
But after being confronted by his angry manager following the game, it is understood that Hart responded by rubbishing Mancini’s claims and telling the Italian that he had urged Tévez to move away from the wall due to the Argentine forward blocking his view of the ball.
Samir Nasri’s subsequent decision to duck out of the way of the shot, while sticking out his right leg — which deflected the ball beyond Hart — proved the decisive moment and one which Mancini publicly criticised in his post-match press conference.
While the dressing-room inquest following the game is nothing out of the ordinary in top-level football, with the immediate aftermath of a defeat often the trigger for grievances to be aired, Mancini’s relationship with his players is proving to be a recurring issue and one which has dogged City this season.

Several members of City’s backroom staff are also understood to be unhappy with Mancini’s approach and what they perceive to be his over-reliance on the Italian-speaking members of his coaching team.
However, with Mancini publicly criticising Hart, Micah Richards, Mario Balotelli and Samir Nasri this season, the antipathy of the backroom staff is now shared by many of the City players who believe that the former Inter Milan coach is too quick to condemn and rarely prepared to praise.
Mancini’s decision to select Balotelli from the start against United, having only recently revealed that he had dropped the Italy forward for his attitude in training, was greeted with surprise by senior players, particularly as he was chosen ahead of Tévez, whose record against United — and alongside fellow striker Sergio Agüero — would seem to merit his inclusion in the team.
But having chosen to play with Balotelli from the start, Mancini’s treatment of the 22 year-old during the game — singling him out for a touchline dressing-down following United’s opening goal — highlighted the man-management issues which have proven to be so divisive among his players.
While Italy coach Cesare Prandelli coaxed from Balotelli some of the best performances of his career during Euro 2012 by handing the forward a pivotal role in his team and treating him like a senior player, Mancini has struggled to get similar displays from a player he claims to understand better than any other manager.
Described as ‘unmanageable’ by Jose Mourinho, who worked with Balotelli at Inter, the forward is determined to remain at City until the end of the season, despite the club and Mancini being willing to listen to offers for him in January.
In the privacy of the dressing-room, Balotelli is prepared to accept the criticism of Mancini, but the player has become bemused by the repeated public condemnations of him by Mancini.
Midfielder Yaya Touré, who is due to leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Ivory Coast in South Africa next month, is also unhappy that the club and Mancini are yet to open negotiations over a new contract at the club, two-and-a-half-years after his arrival from Barcelona.
Touré, meanwhile, has insisted that City can bounce back from the defeat against United and retain the title if their ‘tough men’ come to the fore.
“We are tough men, and when things get difficult, that is when you find the tough men.” Touré said. “We have to be strong mentally, and strong in every other way as well, but the championship of the Premier League is not finished yet.
“We have to forget what we have done in the past. This year will be tough, but we have a fantastic squad and we have the confidence to keep going until the final day.
“Last year was fantastic, but we have to realise that sometimes you have a bad time. We have to be strong guys, tough men, and work harder to turn this around.”
Touré had given City a lifeline against United by scoring the goal in the 60th minute which enabled Pablo Zabaleta to equalise five minutes from full-time.
Robin van Persie’s injury-time free kick gave United a 3-2 win, however, and Touré admits that the goal was a hammer blow.
“It was a dagger in the heart — unbelievable.” Touré said. “But it was a fantastic game for the fans and that is why I like the Premier League, it is the toughest league in the world.”
City scapegoats
Joe Hart Why: Criticised team display at Real Madrid. Mancini said: “Joe Hart should stay in goal and make saves. I am the judge, not Joe Hart.”
Micah Richards Why: Struggled with three-man backline at Ajax. Mancini said: “The system doesn’t matter. Maybe next time, Micah can stay on the bench.”
Mario Balotelli Why: Left out of squad to play Tottenham. Mancini said: “It’s his attitude in training. If you want to play well you have to work hard.”
Samir Nasri Why: Poor effort in wall led to United’s late winner. Mancini said: “We only put three players [in the wall]. Actually, we only had 2 ½ players there.”
