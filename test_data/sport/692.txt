By Iain Spragg

FULL TIME: ENGLAND 55 FRANCE 35
England head coach Stuart Lancaster on his side's display against France at Twickenham...
I'm gutted really. It was one of the most courageous performances I've seen from a team. It was an unbelievable game of rugby."

Ireland celebrate with the Six Nations trophy at Murrayfield
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt on his side's dramatic Championship triumph...
Day's like today build coronaries for coaches. But it also builds character. We're delighted and relieved. I'm delighted on behalf of the team but I spare a thought for England, they were superb today and probably deserved a share of the spoils."

Ireland fans watched the England game on big screens at Murrayfield after their side's win over Scotland

It was a heartbreaking day for the England players at Twickenham
England scrum-half and Man of the Match Ben Youngs reflects on a roller coaster day of Six Nations rugby...
I don't really know what to say. I'm devastated. First of all congratulations to Ireland. From our point of view, we're devastated. We gave it a crack, but you can't let them get back in the game."

Ireland are the Six Nations champions, beating England on points difference. It was an incredible effort by the Red Rose at Twickenham but not quite enough to dethrone Joe Schmidt's side as champions.
80 min Penalty to France and IT'S ALL OVER!!!!!!!
79 min England penalty for collapsing. Ford goes for touch, into the last minute...
78 min Clock stopped. France scrum. England desperately need to pinch the ball...
78 min More England pressure and phases but Cipriani bundled into touch on the French 22.
77 min Lineout won, ball goes wide...
76 min England penalty. Ford kicks and the Red Rose move forward...
74 min. ENGLAND TRY! England 55 France 35. Ford slips in Nowell for his second and England still have time! Ford converts and England need a converted try to be crowned champions...
73 min England scrum six metres short of the France line...
72 min Dusautoir knocks on and England snaffle the ball. Possession turns to a penalty as France are caught offside and Ford belts it down into the 22.
<noframe>Twitter: Shauna Dunleavy - These next 10 minutes will kill me <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
70 min England probe but France hold firm and a grubber kick comes to nothing, allowing Les Bleus to gather possession and kick clear.

68 min England back up to a full compliment of 15 men and have 12 minutes to pull this one out of the fire. 13 points - two converted tries - needed...
66 min. FRANCE TRY! England 48 France 35. It's raining tries - 11 in total now - as Kayser burrows over after a bullying drive from the French pack. The conversion is wide.

63 min. ENGLAND TRY! England 48 France 30. Vunipola powers over close range, Ford adds the extras and England are dreaming again!
59 min. FRANCE TRY! England 41 France 30. A devestating break out from Nakaitaci shreds the England defence and prop Debaty is on hand t take the pass and rumble his way over for a brilliant score. Kockott misses the conversion.
58 min Muscular run from Vunipola has the crowd on its feet but France manage to hold him up and the attack ends in a drop out to the visitors.
<noframe>Twitter: John Quinn - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23France" target="_blank">#France</a> look to have collapsed. I fear it's only a matter of time until <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23England" target="_blank">#England</a> get the points difference they need. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236Nations" target="_blank">#6Nations</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
56 min TMO looking at a potential trip by Haskell. It's pretty clear cut and the blindside flanker is off to the bin. England need to find 10 more points but will have to do so with 14 men for the next 10 minutes.
54 min. ENGLAND TRY! England 41 France 25. Quick hands from Youngs and Ford on the blindside creates space for Nowell and the Exeter wing is able to wriggle over in the corner. Ford adds a sublime touchline conversion and hope springs eternal once again.
52 min. FRANCE PENALTY! England 34 France 25. An errant England hand in the ruck gives France a penalty and substitute Kockott accpets the three points on offer.
50 min France beginning to ring the predictable changes from the bench and we have half an hour left at Twickenham. Based on what we've seen throughout today in the Championship, who knows what might happen?

48 min Sweet Low, Sweet Chariot ringing around Twickenham and the England fans starting to believe a miracle could still be on the cards.

46 min. ENGLAND TRY! England 34 France 22. Another dazzling break from Youngs around the fringes sends the scrum-half scampering behind the French line and Ford is on hand to take the scoring pass. The fly-half adds the conversion. Can England really do this?
<noframe>Twitter: Matthew - Looks like this trophy is heading to Dublin for the second successive year. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SCOvIRE" target="_blank">#SCOvIRE</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nations2015" target="_blank">#6nations2015</a> <a href="http://t.co/A0gBCarUwy" target="_blank">http://t.co/A0gBCarUwy</a></noframe>
42 min. FRANCE TRY! England 27 France 22. A great offload from Guirado sends Mermoz crashing over under the posts and England have made the worst possible start to the half. Plisson adds the conversion and the Red Rose's task has just got significantly larger.
42 min First mistake of the half as Ford goes for touch but it goes out on the full and France move into England territory.
41 min 40 minutes to play and 14 points required as Ford kicks and the second half starts...
<noframe>Twitter: Telegraph Sport - What a half! It's now 27-15 to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EnglandRugby" target="_blank">@EnglandRugby</a> &ndash; see how the home side have turned the momentum around. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23IBMTryTracker" target="_blank">#IBMTryTracker</a> <a href="http://t.co/UC4miiYkW5" target="_blank">http://t.co/UC4miiYkW5</a></noframe>

Ben Youngs scored twice for England in the first half at Twickenham

What a crazy 40 minutes of Test rugby. England exploded into the match, the French surged back and then just as it seemed the title dream was dead and buried, the home side scored two late tries and they are back in genuine contention.
40 min. ENGLAND PENALTY! England 27 France 15. Ford nails it and England have 12 of the 26 points they require. Half way there...
40 min TMO consulted to see whether Mermoz interfered with Joseph off the ball. Penalty to England and the clock is red. Ford going for goal...
<noframe>Twitter: Matt Dickinson - I have no more nails left <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nations2015" target="_blank">#6nations2015</a></noframe>
38 min England kick clear and both sets of players look happy to catch their breath for a second!

35 min ENGLAND TRY! England 24 France 15. An incredible break from Joseph from his own 22 takes England into the French 22. The penalty goes to the Red Rose, Brown taps and goes and Youngs is there to burst through the line and score. Ford slots the extras and this game is proving just as the dramatic as the two which preceded it.
33 min The try seems to have steadied English nerves and with the target of 24 more points to overhaul Ireland, things are looking marginally rosier for the home side.
<noframe>Twitter: Rob Heaton - Try! <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EnglandRugby" target="_blank">@EnglandRugby</a> TMO correctly spots ball comes of leg. Gr8 conversion kick George Ford <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> 17-15 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SixNations" target="_blank">#SixNations</a></noframe>

29 min ENGLAND TRY! England 17 France 15. England think they've scored through Watson after a great break from Youngs. After a prolonged period of consultation looking for phantom offsides and knock ons, the TMO decides the try is legitimate. Ford adds another brilliant conversion and England are back in the lead.
28 min. Stupid from England as Cole is pinged for playing the ball off his feet and just moments after dragging themselves into contention, they present France with a penalty opportunity. Luckily for them, Plisson is off target.
Very welcome points for the home side as Ford slots the penalty.
25 min After it all settles down after the TMO rules that Lawes wasn't late on Plisson, England get the nudge at the scrum and win a penalty. Ford lining up the posts...

<noframe>Twitter: Adam Robert Langford - That was a proper tackle that. Love Courtney Lawes <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
25 min A minor fight erupts as France take exception to a huge hit, perhaps late, from Lawes on Plisson which rattle the fly-half to his bones.
23 min More inaccuracy from England with a forward offload in the French 22 and the chance to build pressure disappears. At the moment, the Red Rose have frozen in the headlights while France are playing out of their collective skins.
<noframe>Twitter: Jack Gavigan - 20 minutes ago, we were wondering whether England will beat France by 26 pts. Now we're wondering whether England can beat France! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
21 min. More misery for England as Cole is penalised for pulling down the scrum but Plisson spurns the easy three points on offer with a howling miss.
20 min Nine missed tackles by England already this afternoon - Lancaster looks a picture of calm but will be secretly fuming.
<noframe>Twitter: Freddie Keighley - No way that's a try that 4th official is clueless <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> Foot placed outside and ball dropped <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23muppet" target="_blank">#muppet</a></noframe>
17 min FRANCE TRY! England 7 France 15. England's title hopes are going up in smoke as wing Nakaitaci scores a controversial try for Les Bleus. Owens asks the TMO to have a look at it and despite replays suggesting he's lost control of it in the process of grounding, the TMO thinks otherwise and the score stands. Plisson adds the extras.
<noframe>Twitter: Catherine Maryon - What went wrong there? France go for a walk and score a try while England stand and watch <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23rugby" target="_blank">#rugby</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
13 min FRANCE TRY! England 7 France 8. Lawes can't gather Youngs pass and from inside his own half Tillous-Borde is able to sprint clear and score a breakaway try. Plisson cannot add the conversion however.
12 min Marler charges down Plisson's clearing kick but Spedding is alert and tidies up the loose ball in the French 22.

Ben Youngs gave England a dream start against the French at Twickenham
10 min. FRANCE PENALTY! England 7 France 3. Ford gets isolated and is pinged for not releasing in the tackle. Plisson knocks over the ensuing penalty and France have a foothold in the match.
8 min Fickou and Mermoz threaten down the left wing but Engand turn them over and kick long. For a second it looks like Ford has successfully collected and is en route to the line but he knocks on and the chance evaporates.
<noframe>Twitter: Duncan Metcalfe - Good to see the best ref in northern hemisphere is in charge. Or best in the world? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
5 min Ford off traget with his long range effort but it's still exactly the start England were dreaming of. 19 more unanswered points required.
4 min Penalty to England after Owens pings France for wheeling the scrum. Robshaw instructs Ford to kick for the three points...
2 min ENGLAND TRY! England 7 France 0. England come rushing through on France, steal the ball and break. Joseph, Brown and Ford are all involved and it's Ben Youngs who swivels out of the tackle to score. What a start from England and Ford then lifts the roof with a superb touchline conversion.
1 min Early break from Burrell but he spills the ball in the tackle and France have the scrum on the England 10 metre line.
1 min Referee Nigel Owens blows his whistle, Plisson kicks-off and 'Le Crunch' begins...
16.58 Anthems completed, the players shed their training tops and battle at HQ will be joined shortly...
16.56 France out on the pitch, England keep them waiting for a minute or two...emerging eventually behind Dan Cole, who's afforded the honour of leading them out to mark his 50th cap.

Saint-Andre is under intense pressure after a mediocre Six Nations for France
16.53 France have won just 15 of 36 Tests since Philippe Saint-Andre was appointed but the head coach once again insisted this week that quitting simply wasn’t an option...
True, the record is not good, there are some reasons, some excuses, but still this is a job I love. And let us remember that so many people go to work just to pay bills and survive. Don’t talk either about players having fear on the field. Rugby is not scary. Fighting a war is scary.”

16.50 The head coach makes what for him is a modest two changes to his starting XV today. At fly-half Jules Plisson is recalled in place of the injured Camille Lopez while Vincent Debaty starts at loose-head at the expense of Eddy Ben Arous. Saint-Andre has also swapped two on the bench with prop Uini Atonio coming in for Thomas Domingo and Remi Tales taking Lopez's spot as the back-up number 10.
<noframe>Twitter: angus blair - This game is crying out for Cipriani to come on in the last 25 minutes and open up the game <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>
16.47 France eased some of the pressure on the beleaguered Saint-Andre last week with their 29-0 success against Italy in the Stadio Olimpico but the result has far from papered over all the cracks – or indeed convinced a sceptical media or frustrated rugby public.

16.45 England narrowly missed out on last season’s title on points difference to Ireland despite thumping Italy 52-11 in Rome in their final game of the tournament and skipper Chris Robshaw is understandably eager to avoid another near miss...
All the guys are extremely excited and desperate to get that bit of silverware at the end, that significant trophy that we haven't managed to get yet. Having gone so close in recent years has been tough for myself and the other guys involved. As a player you want to be picking up silverware. Unfortunately that's eluded us a couple of times.”

Dan Cole reaches a half century of Test match appearances for the Red Rose today at Twickenham
16.41 It’s a big day for Leicester prop Dan Cole, who wins his 50th cap for England following his Test debut against Wales at Twickenham five years ago. The Tiger also played in all three Tests for the Lions against the Wallabies in 2013.
16.40 Your teams for today are:
ENGLAND: Mike Brown; Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph, Luther Burrell, Jack Nowell; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, Dan Cole, Geoff Parling, Courtney Lawes, James Haskell, Chris Robshaw (captain), Billy Vunipola.
Replacements: Tom Youngs, Mako Vunipola, Kieran Brookes, Nick Easter, Tom Wood, Richard Wigglesworth, Danny Cipriani, Billy Twelvetrees.
FRANCE: Scott Spedding; Yoann Huget, Gael Fickou, Maxime Mermoz, Noa Nakaitaci; Jules Plisson, Sebastien Tillous-Borde; Vincent Debaty, Guilhem Guirado, Nicolas Mas, Alexandre Flanquart, Yoann Maestri, Thierry Dusautoir (captain), Bernard LeRoux, Loann Goujon.
Replacements: Benjamin Kayser, Rabah Slimani, Uini Atonio, Romain Taofifenua, Damien Chouly, Rory Kockott, Remi Tales, Mathieu Bastareaud.

16.38 Lancaster has made just the one change from the team which made such heavy work of despatching Scotland at Twickenham seven days ago, recalling second row Geoff Parling at the expense of Dave Attwood. On the bench, Parling’s place among the substitutes is taken by Nick Easter.
16.36 The last time England faced France they were ambushed in Paris courtesy of a late try from substitute Gael Fickou. The two teams have followed distinctly different arcs since that clash with England making progress under Stuart Lancaster while France have seemingly lurched from one crisis to another under Saint-Andre’s troubled reign as head coach.

16.31 The French have not won at HQ since they were 21-15 victors in London back in 2007. James Haskell, who starts against Les Bleus today, is the lone survivor from that England team beaten eight years ago while Nicolas Mas was on the bench for the French. The Montpellier prop starts for Philippe Saint-Andre’s team this afternoon.

The England team arrives at Twickenham for their crunch encounter with the French
16.28 Before we go any further, I have a public service announcement for all those who might be experiencing withdrawal symptoms at the end of the 80 minutes at Twickenham - BBC Two are screening The Six Nations Greatest Moments at 7pm on Sunday, featuring classic archive footage and untold stories from such luminaries as Jonny Wilkinson, Brian O’Driscoll, Sir Clive Woodward, Will Carling, Matt Dawson and Martin Johnson.
16.27 So England need to beat France at Twickenham and they need to do it by 26 points? However erratic and wayward Les Bleus have been in this year's Championship, that's a big ask in anyone's book.
FULL-TIME: SCOTLAND 10 IRELAND 40
80 min Madigan misses penalty with the final kick of the match but Ireland have absolutely thumped Scotland by a record scoreline. It all means England must beat France at Twickenham by 26 points if they are to deny the defending champions back-to-bac to titles. Wales are definitely out of contention and all eyes switch to London for the 5pm kick-off. Stick with us for all the action...
77 min Three minutes to play and Ireland have a 26-point cushion over England should there be no further scores at Murrayfield...

75min Hogg seemed to have scored but replays show he dropped the ball over the line under pressure from Heaslip and the cheers from Dublin are deafening.

72 min IRELAND TRY! Scotland 10 Ireland 40. Ireland absolutely pumme the Scotland line and the overlap they create is massive - O'Brien man who eventually reaches out a long arm to stretch over the line. Madigan bangs over the conversion and Ireland are the red hot favourites for the Championship now.
70 min As things stand, England will need a 19 point winning margin against France...

67 min Interesting now - if Ireland stick rather than twist, they'll head Wales but still have to worry about England. Should Ireland be ambitious and look for more, they could set the English an even more daunting task.
66 min Murray earns Ireland a little breathing space with a hacked clearance which finds no-one at home for Scotland and the visitors move gratefully out of their own half.

63 min Ireland have some defending to do now as Scotland move into their 22. It's going to be a nervy final 15 minutes whatever happens...

61 min. IRELAND PENALTY! Scotland 10 Ireland 33. Sexton holds his nerve to land what could be a pivotal penalty, knocking it over from 30 metres. Ireland are clear of Wales as things stand with England still to play...

Jared payne scored Ireland's third try at Murrayfield

56 min No! Sexton off target again, albeit from long range, and the Principality breathes another sigh of relief!
55 min Yellow card for Geoff Cross for playing the ball off his feet. Scotland down to 14 men and Sexton has a penalty chance and a shot at redemption...
<noframe>Twitter: John Quinn - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23France" target="_blank">#France</a> look to have collapsed.

52 min. Sextom misses a sitter of a penalty chance and for now Wales are still in pole position! The fly-half will be praying that's not a miss that denies Ireland the title!

49 min IRELAND TRY! Scotland 10 Ireland 30. Henshaw's midfield partner - Jared Payne - succeeds where his mate couldn't, blasting his way through the Scottish midfield from close range. Sexton has no problem with the conversion and Ireland are up to 30 points.
48 min Scotland so far this half struggling to get out of their own half as Ireland turn the screw and Henshaw almost bursts through the midfield tacklers but he is finally felled.

44 min. IRELAND PENALTY! Scotland 10 Ireland 23. The fly-half is target and slowly but for the moment surely, Ireland have Wales in their sights. Eight points the deficit now...
43 min Another drive from O'Mahony and then Best and the Scotland defence is creaking. The inevitable penalty follows and Sexton this time opts for a shot at the sticks.
42 min Ireland probe through the tireless O'Mahony early in the half but Scotland manage to snaffle possession and kick clear from their own 22. ireland take a quick lineout and win a penalty when Denton fails to release. Sexton goes for touch...
41 min Sexton gets the second half underway and Ireland are 40 minutes away from either glory or bitter disappointment...

A blistering start from Ireland but a respectable rearguard from Scotland and the outcome of the match - let along the destination of the title - remains in the balance. Ireand need to score 11 unanswered points in the second half to edge out Wales but Scotland have shown their attacking credentials and could yet disappoint the defending champions.
38 min Defensive scrum to Ireland but Scotland cannot pinch possesson against the head and the visitors clear. That feed was about as straight as a boomerang!

Sean O'Brien scored a second first-half try for Ireland in Edinburgh
34 min Scotland now fully entering into the increasingly cavalier spirit of this game as both side go hunting tries. It's not a faultless game but it's an entertaining one.

33 min. IRELAND PENALTY! Scotland 10 Ireland 20. The Scots are penalised for collasping the scrum and Sexton launches his penalty attempt high and handsome and through the posts.
<noframe>Twitter: Rob Heaton - Try! <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EnglandRugby" target="_blank">@EnglandRugby</a> TMO correctly spots ball comes of leg.

24 min SCOTLAND TRY! Scotland 10 Ireland 17. Seymour takes Hogg's deft offload in the Ireland 22 but the wing is hauled down. Scotland recycle quickly and Russell sneaks over in the left corner for Scotland's first try. Laidlaw's ugly penalty is at least on target and Scotland are back in contention.
28 min Ireland six adrift of Wales in terms of points difference but with a vastly inferior number of tries score, you can effectively call that seven. Still, it's hardly a yawning chasm, is it?

Ireland go long at the lineout and find Toner, who slips the ball to O'Brien and the flanker is able power through some disappointing tackling for Ireland's second try. Sexton accpets the two extra points on offer and Schmidt's side are 14 points clear and have Wales firmly in their sights.
22 min Fitzgerald and Henshaw combine beautifully down the left wing but hero Hogg is once again up to the defensive attack and frustrates the Ireland pair.

19 min Payne lucky there not to get a yellow card for seemingly tackling Ashe in the air but Garces deems a penalty punishment enough.
18 min. SCOTLAND PENALTY! Scotland 3 Ireland 10. The Irish are caught coming in from the wrong side at the breakdown and Laidlaw slots the simplest of penalties to get his side on the board.
16 min First real threat from Scotland as Scott is dragged down inside the 22 but just as the Ireland defence seems to be stretched, the visitors snaffle the ball at the breakdown and kick clear.
14 min Murray off for Scotland with a broken nose. Ouch!

Skipper Paul O'Connell gave Ireland a dream start at Murrayfield with an early try.

11 min Ireland are already within 10 of Wales in terms of points difference with just less than 70 minutes to play. Absolutely no need to panic yet...
9 min. IRELAND PENALTY! Scotland 0 Ireland 10. The fly-half bisects the uprights and Ireland are motoring along nicely.
8 min Massive bomb from Sexton but Hogg stands firm under pressure from Kearney to take the ball. It is however a penalty to Ireland for an earlier infringement and Sexton steps forward...
7 min Scotland pinged for obstruction on Fitzgerald and Ireland kick deep into enemy territory.
<noframe>Twitter: Jack Gavigan - 20 minutes ago, we were wondering whether England will beat France by 26 pts. Now we're wondering whether England can beat France! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>

Ireland need a big win in Edinburgh against Scotland
Ireland do get their early score - O'Connell powering over from short range for his seventh try in his 101th Test for his country. Exactly the start Joe Schmidt's side wanted, especially as Sexton knocks over the conversion, albeit off the post.
3 min Ireland nearly score as Henshaw races through the midfield but he's hauled down a metre short when he probably should have passed to Fitzgerald outside.
2 min First scrum to Ireland after Scotland fumble but the home side have made a bright start with ball in hand, running at the Irish defence.
1 min Russell kicks and the second Championship match of the day is alive and kicking.
14.27 Anthems in full swing and we're a couple of minutes from kick-off in Edinburgh.
SCOTLAND: Stuart Hogg; Dougie Fife, Mark Bennett, Matt Scott, Tommy Seymour; Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw (captain); Ryan Grant, Ross Ford, Euan Murray, Jim Hamilton, Jonny Gray, Adam Ashe, Blair Cowan, David Denton.
Replacements: Fraser Brown, Alasdair Dickinson, Geoff Cross, Tim Swinson, Rob Harley, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, Greig Tonks, Tim Visser.
IRELAND: Rob Kearney; Tommy Bowe, Jared Payne, Robbie Henshaw, Luke Fitzgerald; Jonathan Sexton, Conor Murray; Cian Healy, Rory Best, Mike Ross, Devin Toner, Paul O’Connell (captain), Peter O’Mahony, Sean O’Brien, Jamie Heaslip.
Replacements: Sean Cronin, Jack McGrath, Martin Moore, Iain Henderson, Jordi Murphy, Eoin Reddan, Ian Madigan, Felix Jones.
<noframe>Twitter: Freddie Keighley - No way that's a try that 4th official is clueless <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> Foot placed outside and ball dropped <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23muppet" target="_blank">#muppet</a></noframe>
14.25 Ireland have also made just two changes to their side for today’s game following last week’s defeat to Wales in Cardiff – the result which abruptly ended their dreams of the Grand Slam. Leinster wing Luke Fitzgerald is recalled for his first cap since featuring against the All Blacks two years ago at the expense of Simon Zebo while prop Cian Healy starts in the front row in place Jack McGrath.
14.23 For winless Scotland, victory would ensure they avoid the ignominy of losing all five of their Six Nations fixtures. This season’s form book suggests an Irish victory but they’ve lost on their last two visits to Edinburgh, going down 12-8 in 2013 courtesy of four penalties from Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw. The last time the two sides met last year however, Ireland gave the Scots a bit of a chasing with a 28-6 win in Dublin.
Scotland may have lost to England last time out but Vern Cotter’s side did show glimpses at Twickenham of their potential and the Kiwi coach has kept the personnel changes to his starting XV for today to a minimum.
Those changes both come in the pack. Glasgow flanker Adam Ashe is recalled on the blindside at the expense of Rob Harley while his Warriors team-mate Ryan Grant replaces Alasdair Dickinson at loose head prop. The pair’s inclusion means Scotland start today with eight Glasgow players in their line-up.
14.20 Wow! Wales amazing victory over Italy has put the cat among the pigeons, hasn't it? Ireland need a winning margin of 21 points a Murrayfield this afternoon to edge in front of the Welsh.
FULL-TIME: ITALY 20 WALES 61
Incredible stuff in Rome. Wales are now in pole position and as things stand Ireland need to beat Scotland by 21 points and England must overcme France by 17 points if they are deny Gatland's side the title.
Yes, an Italy try! Sarto finshes off a stunning counter attack in the dying seconds and that's put a dent in Wales's points difference. The conversion from Orquera is on target and there's a glimmer of hope for Ireland and England...
<noframe>Twitter: Catherine Maryon - What went wrong there?

77 min That was nearly yet another Wales try - Gareth Davies spilling the ball with the line at his mercy!
<noframe>Twitter: Duncan Metcalfe - Good to see the best ref in northern hemisphere is in charge. Or best in the world? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>

73 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 61. Yes, another try - this time Scott Williams is the man to touch down - one of four Welshman lining up to score that one - as Wales go almost the length of the pitch. Biggar adds two more points.
<noframe>Twitter: angus blair - This game is crying out for Cipriani to come on in the last 25 minutes and open up the game <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a></noframe>

68 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 54. This is truly unbelievable. This time it's Warburton who is the beneficiary of some abject Italian tackling, galloping over from the 22. Biggar adds the easy converison and Wales have surged past the half century mark.
66 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 47. Webb breaks from the base of a maul and despite the attentions of Sarto, he wriggles through the tackle to score. Biggar for once is off target with the conversion.
65 min No try! Italy manage to get hands under the ball and they're reprieved for the moment.
65 min The referee has gone to the TMO to see whether Wyn Jones has been able to ground the ball over the line after a fine drive from the forwards...

64 min Another sin bin for Italy as Geldenhuys is sent from the pitch for coming in at the wrong side...
63 min Masi is back on the pitch but the momentum of the match feels all in Wales' favour now. The penalties are all ging Wales' way - that's the 15th Italy have conceded - and the Azzurri just want to hear the final whistle as soon as possible.
<noframe>Twitter: Donna Traynor - Joe Schmidt says he won't watch the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> He's going for his dinner!!! How can he eat at a time like this? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IrishRugby" target="_blank">@IrishRugby</a></noframe>

A hat-trick for North, who muscles his way through some suspect Italian tackling and it's now merely a case of how many the visitors can amass. Biggar knocks over the conversion in double quick time and the Azzurri are in complete disarray.

Liam Williams sparked the Wales second-half try salvo in Rome
54 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 35. Wales take full advantage of their numerical superiority, making space on the left for North who easily fends off Sarto to score his second of the match. Biggar lands a sublime touchline conversion and Wales are flying...
54 min More bad news for Italy, Masi is off for 10 minutes after being shown a yellow card for a tackle off the ball. Wales are on the charge now.
52 min More on the Leigh Halfpenny injury scare...
<noframe>Twitter: Aidan Buckley - Alright France, I know we've had our issues in the past but do us a solid here pls <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23ENGvFRA" target="_blank">#ENGvFRA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SixNations" target="_blank">#SixNations</a></noframe>
49 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 28. Williams goes from finisher to creater, catching an Italian chip, counter attacking and then putting North clean through for an unmolested canter over the line. Biggar adds another conversion and suddenly they;re streets ahead. That score leaves Wales 10 points shy of England in terms of points difference!
47 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 21. Wales string together the phases and Italy eventually concede the penalty. Webb takes a quick tap, darts forward and Williams appears on his shoulder like a runaway train to slice through the Italians for the score. Biggar adds the extras.
44 min Wales try the rolling maul with initial success in Italian territory but Bergmasco strips the ball and Italy are able to clear.

Leigh Halfpenny was forced from the field with a serious head injury
42 min They cope well - winning clean scrum ball which goes wide and Scott Wlliams finds space on the right wing but his offload inside to Webb goes forward.
42 min Early advantage to Wales as Italy knock on in their own half. Scrum time... how will Wales fare up front in this half?
41 min Biggar kicks to restart the game in Rome and the it's confirmed that Halfpenny will play no further part in this match after that shuddering blow to the head.

Giovanbattista Venditti scored a first-half try for the Italians in the Stadio Olimpico.
40 min. WALES PENALTY! Italy 13 Wales 14. The Azzurri are caught offSIde and this time Wales go for the points, Biggar knocking over the penalty with the last kick of the half. Wales have a slender advatnage but need more if they're to worry Ireland and England in terms of the battle for the title.
38 min Wales win a penalty but elect for touch and the catch and drive raher than the possible three points...
37 min Wales on the attack in the Italian 22 but their defence around the fringes is ferocious and Wales try the Roberts crash ball in midfield. He makes a couple of metres but no more.
35 min Italy make mincemeat of the Wales scrum again to win the penalty and the referee makes it crystal clear to Rob Evans that he's on a last warning!
33 min Scott Williams on for a clearly dazed Halfpenny. Not sure whether it's a temporary substitution or not...
33 min Barnstorming break by the big Italy eight Vunisa and it takes a brave tackle by Halfpenny to stop the charge. Unfortunately the Wales 15 has taken a heavy knee to the head in the process and isn't looking good...
32 min North briefly threatens to escape down the right touchline but Bergamasco gets across in time to drag the wing down and avert the danger.

Jamie Roberts scored Wales' opening try agianst Italy in Rome
29 min Another penalty to Italy at the scrum and there's no doubt Wales are in trouble at the set piece at the moment.
24 min WALES TRY! Italy 13 Wales 11. Huge pressure on Wales as Italy battter the defensive line and as the gaps begin to appear it's Venditti who crashes through Roberts' tackle to give the home side a try. Orquera slots the easy penalty chance and Italy surge back into the lead.
23 min Italy get the penalty after Wales are adjudged to have collapsed a scrum and for the first time in the game the Azzurri show signs of getting the edge up front.
19 min WALES TRY! Italy 6 Wales 11. Halfpenny's intelligent kick turns the Italian defence and Jamie Roberts is quickest tot the bouncing ball to touch down in the left corner. Halfpenny however is off target with the conversion but the try is enough to put the visitors in front for the first time.

Haimona opened the scoring for Itlay before going off with an arm injury
15 min Scrappy start so far but Italy are definitely up for this one and have already showed more attacking intent in the opening 15 minutes than they mustered in 80 against France.
12 min. WALES PENALTY! Italy 6 Wales 6. Penalty ping pong at the moment. Bergamasco is penalised for blocking from the kick-off and Halfpenny makes no mistake with the resutling penalty. All square again in the Stadio Olimpico.
10 min. ITALY PENALTY! Italy 6 Wales 3. Charteris is pinged for taking the jumper out in the air at the lineout and substitute fly-half Orquera is on target with the conversion to restore the Azzurri's advantage.
7 min. WALES PENALTY! Italy 3 Wales 3. Halfpenny draws Wales level with the penalty and it's all square in Rome for the moment.
6 min A couple of darts from Webb gets Wales going forward and it's a penalty to the visitord as Italy stray offside.
5 min Long break in play as Haimona receievs treatment. Looks like the fly-half's match is over already with an arm injury. Orquera comes on for Italy.
4 min First Wales spill possession and then Italy knock on and the end result is a scrum to Wales outside the opposition 22.
3 min Penalty to Wales after Williams is challenged illegally in the air but it's out of range for Halfpenny and he goes for touch.
2 min. ITALY PENALTY! Italy 3 Wales 0. The Welsh concede an instant penalty from the kick-off for blocking and Haimona steps up and knocks it over for the perfect start for the home side.
1 min Our referee, New Zealander Chris Pollock, whistles, Haimona kicks and we're up and running in Rome.
12.27 Both anthems are done and dusted and the wait is nearly over. Can Wales win? Can they win by enough to put pressure on Ireland and England? Or can the Italians bounce back from last week's mauling by France?
12.23 Wales march up the steps from the bowels of the Stadio Olimpico and Gatland's side are out on the pitch. Italy follow seconds later and we're just over five minutes from kick-off in Rome.
12.22 The memories of their woeful display against the French are still fresh but head coach Jacques Brunel insists Italy will be a different animal in Rome today...
We wanted to build on the victory [against Scotland] in Edinburgh but we did not succeed. I expect a tough game on Saturday but I expect that we will give a different picture from the one seen last Sunday. Wales will try to impose its own rhythm, its intensity, its power. They are a team that has confidence in its game and we expect a Welsh XV that will have the ability to apply pressure with ball in hand and with the boot.”

12.15 Former Tigers front rower Martin Castrogiovanni also returns to the fray after coming off worse in an argument with a friend’s dog while prop Michele Rizzo replaces the injured Matias Aguero. In the backs, Zebre fly-half Kelly Haimona returns to the starting XV after missing the France game through injury.
12.11 Elsewhere, Jacques Brunel has recalled veteran flanker Mauro Bergamasco on the openside while Leicester hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini takes over the captaincy reins while Parisse puts his feet up.

Italy captain Sergio Parisse will be conspicious by his absence in Rome today through injury.
12.08 The bad news for the Azzurri is talismanic skipper Sergio Parisse is ruled out by the foot ligament injury he sustained against Les Bleus in Rome six days ago. Zebre number eight Samuela Vunisa is handed the unenviable task of filling the void created by the loss of the Italy captain.
12.05 There is also the small matter of avoiding the Wooden Spoon. Their last-gasp victory over Scotland in Edinburgh last month was only their second ever Six Nations victory away from home but they could yet finish bottom of the table again this year if they lose today and Scotland overcome Ireland at Murrayfield.
12.00 For their part Italy really should not be lacking motivation this afternoon. Their performance in last weekend’s 29-0 defeat to France was, to be polite, abject in all departments and they owe their supporters a vastly improved display after the way they rolled over against the French.
11.57 According to Warren Gatland, the danger for Wales this afternoon is the temptation to chase the deluge of points they require before the match is actually won...
The challenge to us is to go to Italy and win, and try and win by a significant margin but we know that’s an extremely tough ask and the first job will be to simply get the result.”
11.50 Which leaves the two teams in Rome today looking like this...
ITALY: Luke McLean; Leonardo Sarto, Luca Morisi, Andrea Masi, Giovanbattista Venditti; Kelly Haimona, Edoardo Gori; Michele Rizzo, Leonardo Ghiraldini (captain), Martin Castrogiovanni, George Biagi, Josh Furno, Francesco Minto, Mauro Bergamasco, Samuela Vunisa.
Replacements: Andrea Manici, Alberto De Marchi, Dario Chistolini, Quintin Geldenhuys, Robert Barbieri, Guglielmo Palazzani, Luciano Orquera, Enrico Bacchin.
WALES: Leigh Halfpenny; George North, Jonathan Davies, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Rob Evans, Scott Baldwin, Aaron Jarvis, Luke Charteris, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton (captain), Taulupe Faletau.
Replacements: Ken Owens, Rhys Gill, Scott Andrews, Jake Ball, Justin Tipuric, Gareth Davies, Rhys Priestland, Scott Williams.
11.46 Gatland has made two enforced changes to his starting XV for today’s game with props Aaron Jarvis and Rob Evans replacing the injured pair of Samson Lee and Gethin Jenkins. There are four changes on the bench, with Rhys Gill, Ken Owens and Scott Andrews coming in as front row cover with hooker Richard Hibbard ruled out. Scarlets scrum-half Gareth Davies comes in for Mike Phillips.
11.40 Wales have won seven on the bounce against the Italians but they were beaten 23-20 in Rome in 2007 and the last time the two sides met 12 months ago in the Millennium Stadium the Azzurri got within five points of Gatland’s team with 10 minutes to go before a Leigh Halfpenny penalty wrapped up a nervy 23-15 victory.
11.36 Warren Gatland’s side blew the Six Nations wide open last weekend with their 23-16 victory over Ireland in Cardiff and should the boys in red register a big win in Rome today, they could yet be crowned champions for the fourth time in eight years.

Warren Gatland's team retain hopes of lifting the Six Nations trophy if they can beay Italy in Rome today
11.33 Four teams remain tantalisingly in contention for the title and the first to press their claim for the 2015 Championship are Wales, the guests of Italy at the Stadio Olimpico today.
11.30 Hello and welcome to our live coverage of what promises to be an intriguing and very probably dramatic climax of this year’s Six Nations, a tournament which even in the shadow of the approaching World Cup has provided a captivating spectacle and will only be decided by seven o’clock this evening. Not since 2007 have all three final Six Nations matches had a bearing on the winner.
England, Ireland and Wales, are all level on six points. After Saturday's win in the Calcutta Cup, England are top because of a positive points difference of 37, Ireland second on +33 and Wales' third +12.
The first game of the day kicks off in Rome with Wales needing victory by 26 points to top the table with Ireland and England yet to play. Ireland start next at Murrayfield needing to win by at least five points to overtake England and perhaps more to jump ahead of Wales.
England then run out at Twickenham last with the enormous adavantage, just like Ireland in Paris last year, of knowing precisely what they have to do to end the day above Ireland and Wales.
A victory for France over England by at least eight points would be good enough for the fourth-placed side to win the title if both Wales and Ireland lose.
