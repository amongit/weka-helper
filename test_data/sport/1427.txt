British number two James Ward has reached the second round of qualifying for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells - just 24 hours after landing in California.
Ward beat American Mitchell Krueger 2-6 6-3 7-6 (7-0).
It follows Ward's impressive win over world number 20 John Isner in the Davis Cup in Glasgow last week.
"I usually don't suffer too bad with the jet lag," Ward said. "It's just after the weekend, it's very draining."
The world number 108 added: "You couldn't ask for two more different conditions. It was slow and not so bouncy in Glasgow, and then here the ball is bouncing nearly over my head."
Ward, bidding to break into the world's top 100 for the first time, will next face Germany's Mischa Zverev for a place in the first round of the Masters event.
