Victim's family confronts officer over Hernandez court kiss
FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) -- The family of the man former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is accused of killing has confronted a security officer after Hernandez's mother was allowed to kiss her son's hand in the courtroom.
The kiss happened Tuesday when the judge and jury were out of the courtroom. Hernandez is accused of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd.
After a morning break, Hernandez's mother leaned toward her son sitting at the defense table and asked a court officer if she could touch him.
He said yes, and she grabbed his hand, then kissed it. Hernandez smiled, then rubbed his eyes as his aunt and uncle cried. He then thanked the officer.
Outside the courtroom Wednesday, Lloyd's family told the officer they no longer have a son to kiss.
