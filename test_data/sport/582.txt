Cristiano Ronaldo scored in injury time to give Portugal a 1-0 win over Denmark in a tense Euro 2016 qualifier in Group I on Tuesday.
Ronaldo headed home in the 94th minute following a cross from the right by Ricardo Quaresma, crushing Danes hopes of a draw.
Portugal, which was recovering from a shock 1-0 home loss to Albania on Sunday, made the better start in Copenhagen.
But the home team had the best chance of the first half when a shot by Denmark striker Michael Krohn-Dehli hit the post, after opportunities had fallen earlier for Nani and Ronaldo at the other end.
The tension remained high in the second half, with Nani and Ronaldo again testing Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel, while Portuguese goalie Rui Patricio saw off attempts by Krohn-Dehli and Nicklas Bendtner.

A few minutes before Ronaldo's late winner, the Portugal star was booked for a foul on defender Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. That yellow card was the only one handed out by referee Felix Brych who repeatedly was booed by the Danish fans for his decisions.
"That they score in (injury time) just makes it even more frustrating," Denmark defender Daniel Agger said. "It's pretty hard to say anything else right now. "
The Group I match in Belgrade between Serbia and Albania was abandoned after pitch skirmishes involving players and fans over an Albanian flag that was flown above the stadium by a drone.
