Ex-Bengals CB Terence Newman visits Zimmer, Vikings
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Free agent cornerback Terence Newman has visited Minnesota, considering the possibility of reuniting with Vikings coach Mike Zimmer.
The Vikings confirmed Tuesday that Newman met with team officials. The 36-year-old played the last three seasons with Cincinnati, two with Zimmer as defensive coordinator. Zimmer previously held that role in Dallas, covering Newman's first four years in the NFL. The fifth overall draft pick in 2003, Newman had 32 of his 37 career interceptions with the Cowboys through 2011.
Newman said after last season that he was contemplating retirement.
Xavier Rhodes has been on the rise and Josh Robinson improved in 2014, but even after signing Captain Munnerlyn a year ago the Vikings could use more cornerback depth.
The Vikings also re-signed backup offensive lineman Mike Harris, who started the final five games last season at right tackle as a fill-in for injured starter Phil Loadholt. Harris spent his previous two years in the NFL with the San Diego Chargers.
