Argentine three-quarter Juan Pablo Socino has signed a contract extension with Newcastle Falcons to run until the end of the 2017-18 season.
Socino, 26, has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign following his move from Rotherham, making 22 appearances.
The centre, who has also played at stand-off, is yet to make his full debut for Argentina, but has represented the Jaguars A team.
"I am living my dream of playing professional rugby," Socino said.
"I'm enjoying the experience and pleased that the coaches want me to be a part of this squad for the future."
Director of rugby Dean Richards said: "Juan came to us as a very accomplished player in the Championship who was eager to challenge himself in the Premiership and it is a challenge he has risen to superbly, and has fully earned the two-season extension."
