Hillsborough inquests: David Duckenfield admits causing 96 deaths
The Hillsborough police match commander has agreed his failure to close a tunnel "was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 people".
David Duckenfield also accepted he "froze" during the afternoon of the 1989 football disaster.
Mr Duckenfield was giving evidence for a sixth day at the new Hillsborough inquests in Warrington, Cheshire.
He was being questioned by Paul Greaney QC on behalf of the Police Federation of England and Wales.
Mr Duckenfield, now 70, had earlier denied claims he "bottled it" and "panicked" as the disaster unfolded.
The jury was told the former chief superintendent had at least three minutes to "consider the consequences" of opening an exit gate at the stadium, as a crowd of fans built up outside.
Mr Greaney suggested a child of "average intelligence" could have realised what would happen when the gate, which allowed up to 2,000 fans to enter, was opened.
But Mr Duckenfield said he did "not think of it on the day" because of the pressure he was under.
He had "no idea" Liverpool fans would head through the gate for a tunnel which led to the already-packed terraces, he told the jury.
When asked by Mr Greaney if his failure to take steps to close the tunnel entrance was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 people, Mr Duckenfield replied "yes sir".
Ninety-six Liverpool fans died after crushing at the FA Cup semi final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest held at Hillsborough.
Mr Greaney asked Mr Duckenfield if he had been incompetent in his role on the day of the disaster.
The retired officer answered: "I think it is a view some would agree with sir."
Mr Greaney accused Mr Duckenfield of "concealing" his full knowledge of the geography of the ground from the jury, which he denied.
When asked by the barrister if he "simply froze", Mr Duckenfield said he thought it would be "fair to say that we were all in a state of shock."
It was the match commander's job to "get past any feelings of shock", Mr Greaney said.
"Yes, sir, but I am human," Mr Duckenfield replied.
Earlier in the inquests, he admitted he had lied about fans forcing an exit gate open to enter the ground.
He issued a long apology to the families of the victims, who have been campaigning for 26 years to establish more detail about what happened during the disaster.
John Beggs QC, representing Mr Duckenfield, said: "I think you understand, don't you, why the delay in providing a more gracious and more full apology has caused to many both offence and distress? You understand that?"
"I fully understand that sir," Mr Duckenfield said.
The jury heard how the former police officer struggled to sleep in the run-up to the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster, and at one stage was drinking "half tumblers of whisky" to "find the courage" to read statements.
The court heard he was medically retired from South Yorkshire Police on 10 November 1991, two years after being suspended from duty.
He was certified by a force doctor as "unfit to undertake the duties of a police constable" and was diagnosed with "severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder".

Mr Duckenfield agreed he saw his diagnosis as a "sign of weakness" and tried to "conceal" his conditions from his family and colleagues.
He said it was a "matter of pride" and that he was "very ashamed and embarrassed by it all".
The jury has also heard Mr Duckenfield was interviewed under criminal caution in March last year by officers from Operation Resolve, the ongoing police inquiry into the disaster.
Mr Beggs asked him whether it had "been easy for the last five and a half days to admit that your professional failings led to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children and injuries to many more".
"Has that been easy, Mr Duckenfield, for you?" he said.
"Sir, it's been the most difficult period of my life," Mr Duckenfield said.
The inquests are scheduled to continue on Wednesday.

Christina Lambert QC has finished her questions and David Duckenfield has finished giving his evidence. He has now left the witness box.
Mr Duckenfield said the match "was arguably the event of the year other than a royal visit".
He agreed that a knowledge of the layout of the stadium was important and basic information that might have influenced decision-making.
He said he didn't know which areas were fed by turnstiles A-G. He said that was "basic" information that "would have been nice to have".
The coroner's barrister is asking David Duckenfield about other responsibilities which fell within his area - a hospital and university in Sheffield.
He says he can't recall if either demanded his attention during the 19 days between starting his new job as chief superintendent and the disaster.
The jury has had a short break in proceedings and now David Duckenfield is being re-questioned by Christina Lambert QC, on behalf of the coroner.
John Beggs QC asked Mr Duckenfield: "When you went to Hillsborough on the morning of 15 April 1989, was the very last outcome that you envisaged or wished for, death or injury to a single football supporter in those central pens?"
Mr Duckenfield replied: "I didn't want that at all, sir."
John Beggs QC said: "In front of this jury, many family members in court, many many lawyers and journalists, you've admitted to some serious professional failures."
Mr Duckenfield: "Yes, sir."
Mr Beggs QC: "Do you agree that they were in circumstances where you were new and inexperienced?"
David Duckenfield: "Yes, sir."
Mr Duckenfield claims he did "his best" and never told any other police officers how to record their evidence in relation to Hillsborough.
He said he was never asked to change his own statement and "had no part in a conspiracy" - nor did he know of any.
Mr Beggs QC asked: "Whatever else is said about you, you wouldn't have authorised calling of police dogs if you thought it was a medical emergency?"
Mr Duckenfield : "No."
When an officer ran onto the pitch to stop the match at about 15:05, Mr Duckenfield said he was still "unaware of what precisely was going on".
When the assistant chief constable asked Mr Duckenfield at 15:07 what was going on, he didn't know. He tells the court he may have said it was a pitch invasion.
Mr Duckenfield says the reason why the call was made for dogs at 15:04 was that at that stage, it was still thought possible it was public disorder.
Mr Beggs QC asked Mr Duckenfield: "Is the tragic reality that it simply didn't cross your mind where the supporters would go upon entering the concourse?"
He answered: "Yes, sir."
Mr Beggs continued: "This isn't an excuse; this isn't passing the buck, but none of you in that control box realised what was going to happen, did you?"
Mr Duckenfield replied: "No, sir."
David Duckenfield has been asked again about the opening of exit gate C.
He said he felt he had "no choice at all" when the final plea was made to open it. He said it did it "to save lives".
None of the other officers in the police box told him to close the central tunnel first before opening the gate and he did not consider the central pens to be overcrowded when he opened the gate, Mr Duckenfield said.
David Duckenfield says he cannot remember whether he ever formally decided not to delay the kick off, but agrees it would have been preferable.
The police match commander at the Hillsborough disaster says he'd never monitored crowds in pens at a capacity match before the FA Cup semi-final.
David Duckenfield's told the jury he had not received any training in how to do it either.
The jury hears that in David Duckenfield's oral briefing to officers at Hillsborough he was "preoccupied" with segregation. He stressed it three times.
The jury hears Mr Duckenfield's deputy, Supt Bernard Murray, recalled saying in the control box at 14:30 that "there's a good crowd down there, but we will get them in for 15:00".
The evidence of Liverpool supporter Phillip Duggan is re-read. He was in pen 3 and said that whilst some people were being crushed, others were oblivious.
John Beggs QC, for Mr Duckenfield, suggests that this evidence shows it was "difficult to appreciate the level of congestion" in the pens.
David Duckenfield says none of the four experienced officers in the control box with him told him there was a problem with the crowd in the pens.
He agrees that no Sheffield Wednesday staff alerted him to any problem in the pens either.
John Beggs QC asked: "Did any message come to you from any source at all that there were problems with how those pens were filling?"
Mr Duckenfield replied: "No."
Mr Duckenfield also says he had never monitored crowds in pens at a capacity match, nor had he been trained how to.
Looking at Mr Duckenfield's pre-match briefing, the jury hears his "preoccupation" was segregation of the fans and avoiding fighting.
He agrees that he was not contemplating a crisis relating to crushing, when he had his briefing.
John Beggs QC starts to ask David Duckenfield about the "missing hours" that he says he cannot recall, between 10:00 and 14:00 on the day of the disaster.
The court was told that another police witness gave evidence earlier that the former chief superintendent spent the time walking around the ground.
Answering questions from his own barrister, David Duckenfield agrees police orders for the FA Cup semi-final were drawn up by his predecessor, Ch Supt Brian Mole, and "passed to him for signature".
He also repeats that he did not know about the crushing at Hillsborough that happened at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final.
The police match commander who was in charge during the Hillsborough disaster, who admitted his failures caused the deaths of 96 people, has returned to court for a seventh day this morning.
After last week's apologies to the families, yesterday's admission from David Duckenfield went even further.
He'd previously told the court that his mistake in failing to block off a tunnel which led to the central pens was a "contributory factor" to the disaster.
But under questioning from a lawyer for the police federation he admitted it was a "direct cause" of the 96 deaths.
He's expected to finish giving his evidence later.
I am back at the Hillsborough inquests where David Duckenfield is continuing to be questioned by his own barrister John Beggs QC.
David Duckenfield agreed yesterday at the new Hillsborough inquests that he "froze" after giving the order for an exit gate to be opened.
A lawyer told him "a child of average intelligence" could realise what the consequences of that decision might be.
When Paul Greaney QC put it to the former match commander that his failure to close the tunnel leading to the central pens on the terrace was "the direct cause of the deaths of 96 people," he replied, "Yes, sir".
Mr Duckenfield will return to the witness box this morning.
