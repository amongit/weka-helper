Wayne Rooney celebrated a goal for Manchester United against Totenham by imitating the boxing knockout he suffered at the hands of former team-mate Phil Bardsley.
Video surfaced on Sunday morning of Rooney sparring with Phil Bardsley in his kitchen and appearing to be knocked unconscious by the Stoke City defender.

Manchester United v Tottenham: live
After scoring his side's third goal against Spurs at Old Trafford Rooney ran towards the corner of the Sir Alex Ferguson and East stands, did a bout of shadow boxing, then fell to the floor as if knocked out.

Rooney's imitation of the fight with Bardsley may not have amused the experts who said he should have gone for an MRI scan after appearing to be knocked out by Bardsley.
But the goal celebration immediately brought to mind similar topical efforts such as Craig Bellamy's golf club swing at the Nou Camp days after being accused of hitting team-mate John Arne Riise with one.
