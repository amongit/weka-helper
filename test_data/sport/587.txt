Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind sidelined for a month after picking up injury in Holland’s defeat of Latvia

Manchester United’s injury crisis has escalated with Daley Blind facing at least a month on the sidelines after suffering suspected knee ligament damage during Holland’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Latvia on Sunday.
Blind, a £13.8 million summer signing from Ajax, limped out of the game after just twenty minutes following a collision with a Latvian opponent.
The 24-year-old was able to walk off the pitch rather than be carried off on a stretcher, but after Holland’s 6-0 victory in Amsterdam, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink admitted that Blind may have suffered torn ligaments.
"It doesn't look good,” Hiddink said. “It could be a strain, but it could also be a tear."
Initial suggestions in Holland claim that Blind may have sustained a medial ligament injury rather than a more serious cruciate ligament injury, but the midfielder will be assessed and scanned at United’s Aon Training Centre when he returns to Manchester on Monday.

Goalkeeper David de Gea is rated as doubtful for Saturday’s Premier League trip to Arsenal after dislocating a finger while training with Spain, while Argentine defender Marcos Rojo remains sidelined with a dislocated shoulder suffered against Manchester City earlier this month.
Michael Carrick is also a doubt for the Arsenal game after withdrawing from the England squad with what was described as a ‘minor’ groin strain.
