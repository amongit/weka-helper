Women's British Open 2011: Yani Tseng celebrates historic triumph
Yani Tseng proclaims it a "wonderful honour", as she wins at Carnoustie to make it back-to-back Women's British Open titles.
Tseng tells BBC Sport's Hazel Irvine that her lucky pink outfit may have contributed to her relaxed performance in the final round.
The 22 year-old becomes the youngest player - either male or female - to claim five majors as she finishes four shots ahead of American Brittany Lang.
