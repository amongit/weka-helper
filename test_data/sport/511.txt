Flashback to 2002- The day Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp scored the goal of a genius... in two touches

Many of history’s greatest goals can be picked apart just a little with hindsight. Diego Maradona in 1986: Terry Fenwick can get tighter there, and Peter Shilton could be quicker off his line. Ryan Giggs at Villa Park in 1999: a sloppy ball by Patrick Vieira, and David Seaman should not be getting beaten from that angle. Carlos Alberto in 1970: well, the Italians are knackered, and the match is already won.
But some goals are pure. When you watch them again, you struggle to see how anybody could have stopped them. So it is with Dennis Bergkamp’s exquisite peel-and-swivel against Newcastle on March 2, 2002. It was not just a great goal, but an important goal: a decisive milepost in Arsenal’s Double-winning season.
Bergkamp, interestingly enough, did not regard this goal as “pure”. He claimed in his autobiography, Stillness and Speed, that if the defender Nikos Dabizas had anticipated his move and taken a step back, he would have intercepted. Which was unnecessarily harsh on himself, because the question remains: why would anyone anticipate anything like that?

The goal voted by Arsenal fans as the greatest in the club’s history came 10 minutes into a vital Premier League game at St James’ Park. It capped a characteristic mid-Wenger era Arsenal counter-attack. Vieira played it forward to Bergkamp, who slipped it to Robert Pires on the left before charging into the penalty area. As Pires picks up the ball you can see Bergkamp charging forward, arm raised, calling for it to be played into his path.
But Pires, closely attended by Aaron Hughes, delays the pass for a fraction of a second, so Bergkamp has to check his run. “I want the pass from Pires to my feet, but it comes behind me,” he will later write. “It’s not what I expect, so I think: I need another idea here.
“It’s the all-or-nothing part of my game. I could have gone for the safe way, control the ball and knock it back. Or maybe turn. But I know the defender is stepping in, and the pace of the ball can help me. Ten yards before the ball arrived I made my decision: I’m going to turn him.”
Did you know Telegraph Sport has an ?

And so came what Sam Wallace described in the following Monday’s Daily Telegraph as “one touch so sophisticated that it did not so much guide the ball as issue it a series of instructions”. With his back to goal, Bergkamp steered the ball around Dabizas with his left boot imparting a little check-spin. Then he swivelled, darted around Dabizas’s other side, and met the ball again.
Making sure to keep his body between Dabizas and the ball, Bergkamp opened his body, and with the utmost composure slotted the ball past Shay Given.
Two touches.
“To tell the truth, I was never 100 per cent convinced that Bergkamp meant to do what he did,” said Dabizas, now the technical director at Panathinaikos.
“What do they mean by ‘what did I mean’?” was Bergkamp’s response. “Which part do they think I didn’t mean? Do I see it all in advance? Of course not. You know how the ball will bounce, and how the defender will turn. You know when you push him where the ball will end up, and where the goalkeeper is.” And there was the instinctive genius of Bergkamp in a few sentences. No, we did not know any of those things. Not until he showed them to us, anyway.
