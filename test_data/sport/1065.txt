Australian Open 2015: Serena Williams chasing Steffi Graf's record of grand slam titles

If you press her, Serena Williams can picture what her life will be like after tennis. Just not yet. "I see myself at the beach," she said dreamily, still glowing just a little from her straight-sets victory over Maria Sharapova, a win that secured her sixth Australian Open title. "Or on a boat. But right now, it seems a little far away."
After winning her 19th Grand Slam title, a haul that spans two centuries and three decades, Williams is still a woman relishing the thrill of the chase. This lifted her ahead of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. Steffi Graf, on 22 Grand Slams, is her last remaining challenger. Beyond that: the crown, the mantle, the greatest.
"It is definitely something that motivates me," Williams said. "I never thought I would be sitting and having this discussion. I just had a dream and a racquet and two wonderful parents and a support system that really helped me through it.
"A part of me feels like I have a chance to really create history. And a part of me feels like ‘wow, I've done so much'. I don't think about it too much. I think if I do, I'll be very happy with myself. Impressed, even. And I don't want to do that. I want to play next week, next month, next year."
A simple refusal to rest on her achievements is what has sustained Williams for all these years. When informed that her record in Grand Slam finals stands at 19 wins and only four defeats - a strike rate that none of the modern greats can match - she replied: "I could have won those four. I would have been better."

The decision to pace herself, to build her career almost entirely around peaking for those four majors, has also played its part. Now she is 33, and still so far ahead of the pack that even a peak-Sharapova could barely cling to the pleats of her skirt.
Yet dedication has played as big a part as inspiration in her rise to the top. Nobody in the women's game can deal with her serve when it is firing as it was on Saturday night.
Yet far from being some randomly-bestowed physical gift, the Williams serve - perhaps the deadliest weapon the game has ever seen - is the product of hitting thousands and thousands of serves with her sister and father at the public tennis courts in Compton as a child. Five nights a week. That smooth, repeatable, devastating action is no accident.
"When we were younger my dad had me and my sister just serve a lot," Williams remembered. "We would have this huge shopping cart of balls and we would serve all of them. I don't know if a lot of girls had that focus."
Three decades later, the Williams sisters are still near the top of their game, still the two top ranked players in the United States. "We actually joke with each other," Serena said. "We'll see people in the Legends, and we'll be like ‘I played them!' Which is outrageous. It's really a joke, if you think about it."
What happens during the rest of 2015 is, of course, still a mystery.
Williams may win the four more Grand Slams she needs to overtake Graf. She may win more. She may win none. But the competitive fire is a long way from being extinguished. The beach and the boat will have to wait for a while longer.
