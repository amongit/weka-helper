One of the biggest legacy successes of the 2012 Olympics gained a funding boost last night after the International Inspiration programme received three more years of government backing.
The global initiative, chaired by London 2012 architect Lord Coe, was rewarded by the Department for International Development after a report found it had reached more than 25 million children and in excess of 250,000 teachers, coaches and leaders in Britain and countries like India, Indonesia and Nigeria.
Establishing such a programme formed part of London’s successful bid to host the Games, Coe making a commitment to reach out to young people around the world and help inspire them to take part in sport and physical activity.
It easily met its target of engaging with 12 million children in 20 countries – as well as influencing policy makers – before London 2012. And, two years on, it has now more than doubled that figure. “I’m not surprised but I’m relieved that, independently, we’ve had our work validated and that’s important,” Coe said.
“The great thing about these programmes is that you always need to refine, you need to really understand what is working and what isn’t working, what is best practice, what isn’t best practice.

"We sort of got to 13 million with a year to go before the opening ceremony and to have got up to 25 million that are either being influenced or engaged in high quality physical education or sporting activity is fantastic.”
