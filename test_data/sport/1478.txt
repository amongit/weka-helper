Coverage: England v France live on Saturday 21 March from 19:30 GMT on BBC Red Button, Radio 5 live sports extra and online
Rochelle Clark will win her 100th cap for England in their final Six Nations match against France at Twickenham.
Clark, 33, who made her Test debut against Canada in 2003 and won the World Cup in 2014, will join former hooker Amy Garnett as the joint most-capped England player of all time.
"It is an absolutely fantastic milestone to achieve," said England's acting head coach Nicola Ponsford.
Ponsford has made three changes to the side which beat Scotland last time out.
Bristol's Amber Reed comes in off the bench to start in the centre, while Abbie Scott and Hannah Gallagher also return to the starting line-up in the pack.
Worcester wing Lydia Thompson and Richmond's Fiona Pocock, who has returned after a four-year injury battle, have retained their places.
The game takes place on Saturday at 19:20 GMT, after England's men face France.
England have beaten Scotland and Italy during their Six Nations campaign but suffered defeats to Ireland and Wales.
