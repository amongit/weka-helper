Vladimir Putin plays ice hockey in Sochi
1:44PM BST 11 May 2014
President Vladimir Putin has frequently been seen striking a sporting pose, but on Saturday, the Russian leader played a full game of ice hockey with amateur and professional players.
Mr Putin scored 11 times, helping his team to a 21:4 victory.
The game was organised by the Night Hockey League and took place in the Bolshoy Arena in Sochi's Olympic park as part of the festival of Russian amateur hockey.
Mr Putin created the league in 2011 in an attempt to keep athletes competing over the age of 40.
Speaking after the match, Mr Putin said: “There are no winners or losers here. This is a friendly game. It’s a show and everyone enjoyed it."
