Tottenham Hotspur will sign Cologne central defender Kevin Wimmer in the summer after agreeing a £4.3 million deal for the player.
Wimmer has impressed Spurs scouts this season after starting 24 of Cologne’s 25 Bundesliga games and the 22-year-old fits the profile of the type of defender the club are looking for.
With captain Younes Kaboul and Vlad Chiriches poised to leave White Hart Lane this summer, Spurs are also one of a number of clubs tracking Toby Alderweireld, who has spent the season on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid.
Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez remains one of Tottenham’s primary transfer targets, despite the fact he is yet to play a game this season because of a long-term knee injury.
