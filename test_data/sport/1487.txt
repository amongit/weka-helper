Scotland scrum-half Grayson Hart will switch from Edinburgh to Pro12 rivals Glasgow Warriors this summer.
The New Zealand-born 26-year-old has signed a two-year contract with the Scotstoun outfit subject to a medical.
Hart said: "I've enjoyed the last couple of years in Edinburgh, but this is a new challenge for me, working with a different group of boys.
"I like the way Glasgow play and I feel their style of rugby will really suit my game."
Niko Matawalu is leaving Warriors to play for Bath in the English Premiership at the end of the season and has been the regular first choice with Henry Pyrgos out injured.
Glasgow coach Gregor Townsend revealed that Hart had been close to joining Warriors in 2012 before they signed Fijian Matawalu.
"I was really impressed with Grayson when I first saw him when he was with the Waratahs in 2011-12," he said.

"The following year we were in discussions with him about signing with the Warriors, but he stayed in Australia before moving to Edinburgh the following year.
"He's a scrum-half with a wide range of skills and I believe he will bring something different to our squad next season, competing with Henry and the other scrum-halves for the number nine jersey.
"He is in great physical shape, plays rugby with his head up and has a very good passing game."
Hart played for the New Zealand Under-20s in the 2008 IRB Junior World Championship but qualifies to play for Scotland through his Glasgow-born grandmother.
Since leaving Super Rugby in New South Wales, Hart has made 24 appearances for Edinburgh, scoring five tries, and has won three Scotland caps since making his debut in June.
However, he has found himself behind emerging fellow Scotland international Sam Hidalgo-Clyne in the pecking order at Murrayfield.
