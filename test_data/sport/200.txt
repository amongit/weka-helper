Soccer-Ligue 2 Nimes to be relegated for attempted match fixing
PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Ligue 2 side Nimes will be relegated to the third division at the end of the season after former president Jean-Marc Conrad was found guilty of attempted match fixing, the French League (LFP) said on Tuesday.
LFP disciplinary commission president Sebastien Deneux told a news conference that Conrad, who was handed a seven-year ban, tried to fix four Ligue 2 games as his club were fighting off relegation last season.
Nimes can appeal the decision before the French federation (FFF). (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)
