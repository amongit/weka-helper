Hull FC won their first home game of the season, beating Catalans Dragons to move off the bottom of the Super League.
Catalans's Vincent Duport opened the scoring, but Hull retaliated with tries by Marc Sneyd, Jordan Rankin, Steven Michaels and Fetuli Talanoa.
Thomas Bosc grabbed Dragons' second try to make it 22-10 at the break.
Tom Lineham added two tries for the hosts and Morgan Escare and Zeb Taia went over for Catalans late on.
Having taken the lead through Duport after an excellent offload from Willie Tonga, Dragons let the hosts back into the game with a handling error that allowed Sneyd to sprint clear to score.
Rankin powered over for the home side's second try before Michaels broke away from a weak tackle to record his first Hull FC try.
Dragons' former International Player of the Year Todd Carney, who was risked by Laurent Frayssinous just two weeks on from breaking a rib, left the field five minutes before the break and he was soon joined on the sidelines by Escare, who picked up an injury fielding a kick.
The Black and Whites soon had a fourth try as Talanoa combined well with Sneyd to cross, but the Dragons reduced the deficit just before half-time through Bosc.
But Lineham's second-half double made the win safe for the hosts and, despite late consolations from Escare and Taia, Catalans did not offer enough to ever really worry the hosts.
Defeat leaves the fourth-placed Dragons equal on competition points with Wigan Warriors and Salford Red Devils, who also both lost on Friday, with all three sides now just one point ahead of Hull FC in 10th.

Radford on Hull FC v Catalans Dragons
Hull FC coach Lee Radford:
"I thought it was a really poor spectacle. But I'm absolutely ecstatic that we got the result.
"I'm really pleased. It's been a long time since we've sung our song. I've felt like it's been coming.
"I thought we were professional in how we went about our business in the first 40 minutes, although the breakaway try at the end was disappointing."
Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"You guys [the media] said to us last year that travelling is an issue for us, but the players showed you we can win, like at Leeds and Huddersfield in semi-final footy last year.
"Playing away is not an issue. It's harder than at home, but that's it."
