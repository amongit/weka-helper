England v Switzerland: Four areas Roy Hodgson must address in Switzerland on Monday night

1 England went into the World Cup under the suspicion that its back four might prove the weak point. And those goals conceded against Italy and Uruguay did nothing to counter that particular argument.
So here we are at the start of a new era when Roy Hodgson must decide the best way forward. Looking ahead, the Gary Cahill-Phil Jagielka axis in central defence must be under threat.
For Monday night, I would be amazed if the manager veered away from this partnership seeing as the occasion demands experience and composure. But Cahill ideally needs a bit more pace and mobility next to him, meaning the improving Phil Jones might be handed a chance until the talented John Stones has properly developed.
As for the full-backs, a lack of good right-backs makes replacing Glen Johnson difficult, exemplified by the fact Jones will probably be handed the role in Basle. The situation is thankfully better on the other side where Luke Shaw can hopefully answer the call in time.
For now, though, Leighton Baines must sharpen up on the defensive side by stopping crosses with more determination. That could be important here when Xherdan Shaqiri drifts to that flank.
Hodgson still a local hero in adopted homeland
Rooney can learn from Moore's darker side
Shaqiri centre of attention for right reasons
Hodgson swears his new England plan will work
Welbeck craves England No9 dream
'Sterling can be the English Overmars'
2 Central midfield is also a blank sheet of paper following the international retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.
As a very thorough coach, I am sure Hodgson has thought long and hard on the best way to use people like Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. Not only that, but the best shape to use them in, too, so as to provide enough protection for that back four.
I would bet on Hodgson going with a midfield diamond tonight, with Wilshere tucking in on the left and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain or James Milner doing the same on the right to support Henderson.
It sounds as if a few different formations have been tried on the training ground, which suggests England might switch their shape mid-match if Switzerland start to cause problems. That is when you need an older head to pull things together, something now lacking from England’s midfield.
For that reason, Michael Carrick’s positional know-how will surely be welcome once the Manchester United man returns to fitness. For now, though, it is about finding the right balance against a very hardworking Swiss unit.
3 In a short space of time Raheem Sterling has become central to England’s plans.
His wonderful tight control, his imagination, speed, strength and innate confidence mean the Liverpool teenager is now starting to call the shots when England get the ball. When that happens, any manager would want to make sure that he provides the right platform and in this case that platform surely lies at the forward point of that aforementioned diamond.
While Sterling’s great versatility does give other options, you would ideally want to see the lad in a central position tonight giving Valon Behrami and co all sorts of problems.
On a wider level, it is important that Sterling isn’t saddled with too much expectation because, no matter how talented, we have to remember he is still very young. Others have to chip in to share the load.
That said, it is encouraging that after so many years banking on Wayne Rooney producing, a new kid in town is finally able to dilute Rooney’s importance. St Jakob Park sees the start of something different. Hodgson’s job is ensuring that 'something’ reaps reward.
4 One man’s misfortune is another man’s chance. The injury to Daniel Sturridge should open up the way for Danny Welbeck to stake a claim through the middle.
Hodgson, in fact, might have a totally different player on his hands from the one shunted about at Manchester United. Welbeck’s move to Arsenal seems to have breathed new life into the striker judging by his bold comments upon signing and subsequent form against Norway.
Having played so often – and usually pretty well – on the flank for England, an opportunity may now arise to shine in his natural position in a way he looks set to achieve for Arsène Wenger. Expect a much better finisher as he settles down. Expect him to give Hodgson a serious alternative up front, which should, as a bi-product, keep Rooney on his toes.
It might be, of course, that Welbeck plays on the left on Monday night in a 4-3-3. But even if he does the situation remains unchanged: England now have another forward for this qualifying campaign.
