Six Nations 2015: Staggered kick-off times mean advantage England with Ireland and Wales playing blind

The perpetrators of injustice hope we stop noticing it, and thus the Six Nations Championship comes down to another day of staggered kick-offs that favour the table-topping team, in this case England.
Television companies will sell the three games to be played on Saturday as a single symphony, building to its finale with England v France at Twickenham. It is nothing of the sort.

By scheduling Italy v Wales (12.30pm) to precede Scotland v Ireland (2.30pm) and then the England game against France at 5pm, the organisers hand a blatant advantage to Stuart Lancaster’s men, who can measure their point scoring, tactics, game management and substitutions around events earlier in the day.
Lancaster, who has overseen three second-place finishes and knows the scenario well, admits as much.

“The key decision-makers will be aware what the permutations are and they will make decisions as the game unfolds,” the England head coach said, before reining back: “In terms of the scoreline, if we start obsessing about that then we’re not going to win the game – that’s the long and short of it.”
Seven hours of rolling Six Nations action sounds fine (though some of the games this term have been monotonous), but the truth is that Ireland and Wales will be playing blind while England have a precise target at which to aim.
Could that actually make it harder for them against France? Could it hell.
