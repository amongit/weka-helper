Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic: How Scot can defeat world No1 in Australian Open final on Sunday

1. Keep going with the slider serve
Andy Murray has used the heavily sidespun serve out wide to his opponent’s forehand to great effect in this tournament. In the last two matches, against Nick Kyrgios and Tomas Berdych, he has gone down the middle on the ad court 50 times, and out wide to the backhand only 18. “That is the way to continue against Novak Djokovic,” said Craig O’Shannessy, the lead analyst for the Australian Open. “Djokovic’s backhand return is actually his stronger side. So the slider, which Andy hits so well, is the perfect weapon.”
2. Handcuff him on second serve
Murray’s biggest weakness remains his second serve, which has averaged around 85mph in this tournament. Against Djokovic, he needs to be assertive with it, even if that means committing a couple of double-faults. “Again, he cannot afford to direct it to the backhand side all the time as he would against other opponents, because Djokovic will feast on it,” said O’Shannessy. “So slider second serves must be used to break up the returner’s rhythm. And the other place to go is at the right side of the rib cage, so that Djokovic is jammed and doesn’t have room to swing.”

Andy Murray says women can coach. But did he mean it?
If there is a chink in Murray’s groundstrokes, it is on the running forehand when he is pushed wide to his right-hand side. “Roger Federer has owned him there time after time,” says O’Shannessy. But when Djokovic tried to do the same thing in the 2013 Wimbledon final, Murray responded with a series of huge cross court forehand exocets that his opponent could not handle. One of these shots was actually struck so well that it knocked Djokovic off his feet. “The key thing,” says O’Shannessy, “is to have enough pace on the ball that it cannot be redirected down the line into the empty court Murray has left behind.”

4. Use the slice to break up the rhythm
“I always feel that the low ball is a good play against Novak, particularly on his forehand side,” says O’Shannessy. “He will try to rip his reply with heavy topspin, but enough of those attempts will end up in the net to make a difference.” The downside of this play is that it can be defensive, because a mediocre slice becomes a slow-moving ball, and Djokovic will take control of the rally if he gets that first strike right. But Murray came up with some really vicious low backhand slices in the semi-final against Berdych that even Federer – the acknowledged master of the stroke – would have admired.
5. The drop-shot is a last resort for Djokovic
In the Wimbledon final, one sign that Djokovic felt he was losing the baseline battle came when he changed his game plan early in the third set and started tossing in a series of drop-shots. “The tactic worked for a while,” says O’Shannessy. “Novak won the point with the first four he tried and scored a break of serve, but then Andy got wise to it and started ramming it straight back at him.” If Djokovic goes to the drop-shot again, it could be a clue that he is worried.
