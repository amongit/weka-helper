Top of the HIL
Tom Boon will be under pressure to perform over the next four weeks after Dabang Mumbai bid an eye-catching US$103,000 (£68,000) for the Belgian forward - against his original base price of $20,000. Broken down, Boon will net more than $25,000 per week – a significant sum in world hockey terms as he became HIL’s highest-ever earner. Overall, Mumbai spent $750,000 putting together their outfit.
Team to beat: Punjab Warriors (Mohali)
Beaten in last year’s final after a shoot out, Punjab’s squad is an impressive one for the third edition. Led by Jamie Dwyer, the Australian, and with compatriot Mark Knowles, the world hockey player of the year, on board, the Warriors have quality all over the field, starting with Jaap Stockmann in goal ahead of a world-class defence. Add in Australian corner specialist, Christopher Ciriello, and the tournament’s top scorer Sandeep Singh, and Punjab will be hard to stop.

“I feel we must adapt a style that suits the Indian culture without losing our personal style of play as we get to play with the mixed bag of players from different teams.” Jamie Dwyer
“What was crucial for the league was India's qualification for the Rio Olympics. It was an important part for the sustainability of the league because it means there will be more fan following, more sponsors and support for league.” Mark Knowles
One to watch
Kalinga Lancers successfully bid for four players, including Gurjinder Singh, the Indian drag-flicker and former Punjab Warrior. Given that his original base price was $8,600 and he went for $65,000 shows how much his stock has risen - and that was before his good form at the recent Champions Trophy.
Consistency pays
Delhi Waveriders, the defending champions, have been the most consistent team in the tournament, with 19 wins in 26 matches overall. They also posted the longest unbeaten run with 11, in the first edition.

Stick cricketers
Lucknow-based Uttar Pradesh Wizards is co-owned by Suresh Raina, while India’s one-day captain MS Dhoni is the latest convert, co-owning new franchise Ranchi Rays, which includes England duo Ashley Jackson and Barry Middleton – Nick Catlin (Mumbai) is the only other Englishman in this year’s HIL - and Germany’s Moritz Furste.
What the HIL will be without in 2015...
Pakistani players. Nine were part of the first edition two years ago, but were forced to leave India ahead of the tournament due to a political wrangling. No neighbouring player has since taken part.
