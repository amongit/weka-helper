Davis Cup: Great Britain face quarter-final venue quandary
The sell-out event was the first Davis Cup match to be held at the venue
8 March 2015 Last updated at 20:16
Andy Murray called the atmosphere in Glasgow the best he had experienced - but Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final might be played elsewhere.
Murray beat John Isner on Sunday to clinch victory over United States and set up a tie against France in July.

Andy Murray seals Davis Cup 2015 quarter-final place for Great Britain
It will take place on 17-19 July, the week after Wimbledon, with the venue to be decided by Britain as hosts.
"Ultimately you've got to go with the surface that gives you the best shot of winning," said GB captain Leon Smith.
"The atmosphere's great but it will be even better to be in the semi-final. We've got to try and pick a surface that Andy, James Ward and the core doubles group agree on.
"That's something that we'll put our heads together over the next week as captain and players and just chew the fat.
"Once we've decided what we want we'll go to the suits and ask them to try and make it happen."
Murray added: "The atmosphere was the best I have played in.
The Glasgow crowd cheered the GB team to every point
"But at that time of year we have the option to play outdoors as well, so we will see."
Glasgow's Emirates Arena was a 7,700 sell-out for all three days of the tie against the US, but the indoor conditions might not give Britain as big an advantage against France as playing on grass.
Wimbledon has been ruled out because of the practicalities of turning the venue around in time, just five days after the end of the championships.
France were runners-up last year and beat Germany over the weekend with a team made up of world number 14 Giles Simon, world number 19 Gael Monfils and experienced doubles players Julien Benneteau and Nicolas Mahut.
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a former Wimbledon semi-finalist, is currently injured but could be another option by July.
"I don't think we were favourites coming into this tie [against the US] and France has some of the best doubles players in the world - Slam champions and finalists in doubles," added Murray.
Andy Murray (Singles ranking 5)
Giles Simon (Singles ranking 14)
James Ward (Singles ranking 111)
Gael Monfils (Singles ranking 19)
Jamie Murray (Doubles ranking 33)
Julien Benneteau (Doubles ranking 7)
Dom Inglot (Doubles ranking 38)
Nicolas Mahut (Doubles ranking 18)
"Guys like Mahut and Benneteau are fantastic doubles players, and then they have something like six or seven guys in the top 50 in the world, so I don't know how we could expect to go into the match as favourites."
Asked whether he thinks Britain could go all the way and win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936, Murray said: "To win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do.
"Even someone like Roger Federer, such a great player, it's taken him to have a top four in the world partner [Stan Wawrinka] to help him to do that.
"It's not an easy thing to do. We're playing right at the limits of our level right now. Hopefully we can keep doing that until the end of the year."
