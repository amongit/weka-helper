Carl Frampton ready to conquer the world after victory against Chris Avalos and shouts 'bring me Scott Quigg'

If becoming a box office attraction was Carl Frampton’s aim this year as he targets dominance of the world’s super bantamweight division, the 28‑year-old Northern Irishman took a great leap forward by retaining his IBF 122lb title in Belfast.
The world is now at Frampton’s feet – and his lightning, dangerous hands. Big fight nights beckon in the United States after a thrilling defence of his crown against Chris Avalos.
If his mentor, Barry McGuigan, was the Clones Cyclone, then Frampton is the whirlwind prize-fighter from Tigers Bay; he blew away and dismantled mandatory challenger Avalos inside five pulsating rounds.
Frampton’s evolution is almost complete and he has it all to conquer the world: an exciting style, the ability to sell out arenas and, for this contest, a terrestrial television backer.
Belfast already loved him, but British viewers on ITV would have been thrilled by the main event, while in the United States, Frampton’s fame has been augmented by his elevation to No 1 ranked fighter in the world by Ring Magazine.

Shane McGuigan, Frampton’s trainer, has insisted that they must pursue anyone in the division. His father Barry now agrees. “I think Carl could beat any one of the rivals,” he said. “We are ready for all-comers.”
Scott Quigg, who holds a version of the WBA crown joined Frampton in the ring post-fight.
On the prospect of a fight against Quigg, Frampton said: “I would love it. It’s a summer showdown between the both of us.
“It’s the biggest fight in the UK [other than] Amir Khan-Kell Brook possibly. I think Scott wants it. It’s a huge domestic showdown.”
In London, at the 02 Arena, unbeaten heavyweight Tyson Fury enhanced his credentials for a title fight with Wladimir Klitschko with a patient dismantling of Christian Hammer. And on the same card, Chris Eubank Jnr bounced back after his defeat to Billy Joe Saunders to win the WBA interim middleweight title from Dmitry Chudinov. The 25-year-old’s desire to look for the finish late in the fight speaks volumes for the fighter he is becoming. A rematch with Saunders, or a world title challenge this year, look inevitable.
