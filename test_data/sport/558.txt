BEST GOAL? With 76 goals in total scored in Poland and Ukraine it was a tough category to whittle down but here are the standout thunderbolts, flicks and set-pieces from the tournament. Pick your favourite.
1. Danny Welbeck's back-heel flick to score England's winner against Sweden. Watch YouTube
2. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's roundhouse kick which gave Swedish fans a moment to treasure against France. Watch YouTube

3. David Silva's first for Spain which paved the way for their 4-0 romp in the final against Italy. Watch YouTube
Torres wins golden boot
4. Jakub Blaszczykowski's curler for Poland against Russia capped off a fine counterattack by the co-hosts. Watch YouTube
5. Mario Gomez's pivot and swing of the right boot from Bastian Schweinsteiger's centre as Germany saw off Holland. Watch YouTube
6. Mario Balotelli surge through Germany's defence to blast an unstoppable shot past Manuel Neuer. Watch YouTube

BEST GAME?
1. Sweden 2 England 3. Welbeck's clever winner saw Roy Hodgson's side come from behind to beat Sweden for first time in a competitive fixture.
2. Spain 1 Italy 1 (Part 1) Cesc Fabregas saved Fernando Torres's blushes by scoring the equaliser as the two heavyweights squared up in first Group C match.
3. Spain 4 Italy 0 (final) A masterclass from world champions who saved their best performance until last. Boring, hey? Far from it.
4. Germany 1 Italy 2 (semi-final) Mario Balotteli scores twice as Italy continue their hold over the Germans to reach the final.
5. Denmark 2 Portugal 3 'superstar' Ronaldo became a burden as Portugal came perilously close to throwing away a group game victory.
6. Poland 1 Greece 1 Two red-cards, a penalty save...the tournament opener was the perfect start to a gripping tournament.

BEST PLAYER?
1. Mario Balotelli: striker said to be worth a staggering £200m for his headline performances - most notably his two-goals which booked Italy their place in the final. (Read Italian press reaction)
2. Andres Iniesta: Spain's 'Mr Consistency' pulled all the strings again for the world champions but also has ability to go at his opponents.
3. Andrea Pirlo: Effortlessly elegant at the grand age of 33, showed great close-ball retention and had nerve to score 'Panenka' penalty against England. Watch 'Panenka' penalty.
4. Cristiano Ronaldo: When Portugal captain was not trying to win games single-handedly and not getting frustrated by Lionel Messi chat, he lit up tournament with display against Holland. Watch YouTube
5. Sergio Ramos: part of Spanish defence which only conceded one goal the whole tournament, the Real Madrid man was also in the thick of things at the other end and also produced his own 'Panenka' penalty in shoot-out win over Portugal.

6. Mesut Ozil: Real Madrid midfielder starred in every one of Germany's games, was named man-of-match in group win over Portugal and was oustanding in 4-2 in over Greece.

BEST ENGLAND PLAYER?
1. Steven Gerrard: answered doubts about capacity to cope with the physical demands of a tournament and also whether he is a natural England captain. He created three goals in the group phase and tireless display against Ukraine earned him man-of-match award.
2. John Terry: selected on “football grounds”, the Chelsea captain performances justified Roy Hodgson’s faith. Commanding and dominant defensively but also a persistent threat from set-pieces.
3. Joleon Lescott: had the occasional nervous moment but was also dangerous in the air, scoring against France and forcing a wonderful save against Sweden.

4. Joe Hart: goalkeeper has spread confidence through England's defence and his reaction save to deny France's Alou Diarra was crucial in smoothing path to the quarter-finals. However, he would have expected to stop at least one of Italy’s penalties.
5. Ashley Cole: consistent performer for England but displays overshadowed by penalty shoot-out miss against Italy. Was forced to curb his attacking instincts under new Hodgson regime but was his usual reliable self at left-back.

BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT?
1. England's inability to pass the ball and spot-kick failings yet again which suggests technical and temperamental flaws remain.
2. Holland. Rumours of in-fighting hampered them but 2010 World Cup runners-up turned in a woeful performance in their must-win game against Portugal to exit tournament with a whimper.
3. Wayne Rooney. Suspended for first two games and short of match sharpness upon his return. Was made scapegoat in some quarters for England's quarter-final exit.
4. Return of racism. Despite the scaremongering and sensationalism that put off some supporters and players' families, it ultimately overshadowed some of the early group matches and forced Uefa into action.
5. Cristiano Ronaldo not taking a penalty. Portugal captain was due to take fifth spot-kick against Spain but he insists it wasn't so he could have glory of scoring the winner.


MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT?
1. Andrea Pirlo's cheeky dinked penalty against England as Italy booked their place in the semi-finals.
2. Ireland fans breaking out in a heartrending rendition of “The Fields of Athenry,” with their team 4-0 down against the defending champions and already going home.

3. Ronaldo's double against Holland. The Portugal captain responded to chants of 'Messi, Messi' in decisive fashion as he struck a brace to seal quarter-finals spot.
4. Balotelli's strike and celebration against Germany. Manchester City and the Premier League's favourite bad boy's 'body-building routine' celebration was Italy striker's ultimate high point.
5. Spain's sensational showing against Italy to retain trophy. The defending champions hit back at critics bemoaning their boring style the only way they knew how.
