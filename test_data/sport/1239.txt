Jose Mourinho has claimed Paris Saint-Germain are the dirtiest team Chelsea have faced this season.
Chelsea drew 1-1 in Paris in the first leg of the last-16 Champions League clash against PSG, with the return leg at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.
Eden Hazard was fouled a record-breaking nine times in the Parc des Princes and Chelsea manager Mourinho is still shocked by PSG’s tactics.
“I was surprised in that game,” said Mourinho. “I was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls, was the team making foul after foul, was the team which stopped Hazard with fouls all the time, was the team attacking the man in possession of the ball with two or three players with some very aggressive actions.

“Even a player like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), a typical attacking player, came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering.
“I thought an English team would never be surprised by aggression, because aggression we have in our country. This season we’ve played against sides from the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG. For me, that was a real surprise. With players of such quality, I was expecting more football and less aggression.”
