3 Minnesota pitchers combine to no-hit Creighton at CWS park
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Dalton Sawyer and two relievers combined on a no-hitter in Minnesota's 9-0 victory over Creighton on Sunday at TD Ameritrade Park.
Sawyer pitched a career-high seven innings, Tyler Hanson worked the eighth and Lance Thonvold finished with a 1-2-3 ninth. It was Minnesota's first no-hitter since Tom Windle did it against Western Illinois in 2013.
Sawyer pitched around four walks and hit two batters. Shortstop Michael Handel preserved the no-hitter in the eighth when he went deep into the hole to field Nicky Lopez's sharply hit grounder and force out Daniel Woodrow at second for a fielder's choice.
It was the first nine-inning no-hitter at TD Ameritrade Park, which opened in 2011 and is the home of the College World Series.
