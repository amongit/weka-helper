Receiver Stevie Johnson agrees to 3-year deal with Chargers
SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers have agreed to terms of a three-year contract with free agent wide receiver Stevie Johnson, who's looking to bounce back after two down years.
Johnson became the first player in Buffalo Bills history to have three straight 1,000-yard seasons, from 2010-12. His best season was 2010, when he had 82 catches for 1,073 yards and 10 TDs.
His production fell off the last two seasons. In 2013, his last with Buffalo, he had 52 catches in 12 games, for 597 yards and three scores.
Last year with San Francisco, he caught 35 passes for 435 yards and three touchdowns.
