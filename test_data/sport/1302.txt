Luis Figo launches Fifa presidency manifesto by saying World Cups could be staged over two continents

Luis Figo proposed staging future World Cups over two continents involving up to 48 teams after launching his manifesto for his Fifa presidency campaign.
The former Real Madrid, Barcelona and Portugal star revealed he was in favour of expanding the current 32-nation tournament if he unseated Sepp Blatter at May’s election.
The rank outsider of the four candidates for the presidency thanks to his lack of connections among the 209 voting members, Figo stole a march on his rivals on Thursday by becoming the first of them to publish a formal manifesto.
Boasting star power and endorsements to match from the likes of David Beckham, Jose Mourinho and a host of other stellar names, he was nevertheless forced to sidestep questions at a press conference at Wembley Stadium about precisely how much support he had from those who really matter.
He did declare he was “more and more hopeful” each day of pulling off a huge shock on May 29, something that would allow him to implement a glossy 20-page manifesto containing dozens of proposals.

The most eye-catching of them was his call for an “open debate” at Fifa Congress on the future of the World Cup, including discussing expansion to 40 teams – something previously proposed by Uefa president Michel Platini.
Also on the table, he said, would be a 48-nation event played across two continents, with each hosting 24 teams during the group phase before a final knockout stage in one country.
Figo added: “My starting point in this debate is that by increasing the number of teams participating in the World Cup, we not only make sure that we include more countries from across the world in the greatest football competition in the world, but also enable Fifa to raise significant increased revenues that can be used to invest in the growth of the game globally.”
In a similar vein, the 2001 Fifa World Player of the Year proposed spreading half of the governing body’s £1.6 billion revenue over four years to associations in order to fund grassroots football.
And he said two-thirds of Fifa’s £970 million cash reserves should be redistributed to the 209 national federations.
The election in May is a vote of those members, the backing of the majority of which Blatter already appears to enjoy.
“There are obstacles that will have to be overcome,” admitted Figo, who was hoping his promises to clean up a scandal-ridden organisation would win over disenchanted federations.
He added: “In the recent months and even years, I have seen the image of Fifa deteriorate.
“I speak to many people in football – players, managers and association presidents – and they have told me something has to be changed.
“I agree with them and this is why I want to become Fifa president. I’m not the kind of man who sits aside and refuses to act.
“I want a new style of leadership of Fifa that can restore transparency, cooperation and solidarity.
“In my manifesto, I have outlined clearly how I would seek to restore Fifa’s credibility and rebuild trust in it. This will not be a quick fix, it requires fundamental changes.”
He refused to criticise Blatter directly, saying only: “I think sometimes a point is reached when change is needed, a new era arrives.”
Figo, who said he was using his career earnings to fund the campaign, also proposed changes to the rules of football.
The 42-year-old’s manifesto called for trials for sin bins for unsporting behaviour to referees, and for a resurrection of the old offside law in which not interfering with play was irrelevant.
Figo also insisted he was an “independent” candidate, despite using the same PR agency employed by Uefa and Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein, who is running for the presidency as well.
The other candidate, Michael van Praag, is also a member of the executive committee of Uefa, which appears to be orchestrating a somewhat co-ordinated approach to weakening – if not necessarily defeating – Blatter.
Figo’s proposals, which include new checks and balances on the power of the president, should also provoke a debate which could lead to change even in the event of his defeat.
