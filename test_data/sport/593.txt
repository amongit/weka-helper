Just when it seemed that England supporters, let alone the players, might need the professional services of the sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, Daniel Sturridge gave them something positive to think about.
After initially being wasted out wide by Roy Hodgson, Sturridge eventually moved inside, showing his finishing abilities that have spiced his Liverpool season nine minutes from time. Sturridge’s 23rd goal in 28 appearances for club and country this season ended England’s barren run of 264 minutes. However deserved, England’s winner still masked many flaws.
This was a largely frustrating friendly performance from England, barring a handful of encouraging signs, including a display of such vibrancy from Raheem Sterling that the Liverpool youngster has to go to the World Cup.
First on the right, then the left, Sterling kept taking on full-backs, kept moving forward with real speed and passing with real accuracy. He looks stronger than before, less easy to knock off the ball and surely confirmed his place in Hodgson’s 23 for Brazil.
There were other hope-filled elements to England’s evening work at Wembley. There was another reminder of Joe Hart’s quality, and particular his timing in leaving the line to see off intermittent Danish danger.

Alan Smith: A close call but Shaw wins my vote over Cole
Five things we learnt from Wembley win
There was a first half that showed Ashley Cole is far from finished as an international force, the 33-year-old defending well and attacking athletically, and a second half that highlighted the promise of Luke Shaw, Cole’s rival to be understudy to Leighton Baines in Brazil.
There was Adam Lallana’s arrival for a below-par, bruised Jack Wilshere; the Southampton player brought invention, touch in tight areas, and, ultimately, the perfect cross for Sturridge to end the deadlock in a disappointing game.
Denmark’s coach, Morten Olsen, wished Hodgson’s side good luck at the World Cup, adding “you need it”, a remark eliciting scorn amongst the many patriots surrounding England. “How dare he?” ran the constant refrain. But Olsen, a fine, tactically smart player in the 70s and 80s, as well as a respected coach, had a point that England should heed.
England began the game with only six hours left of fine-tuning before their World Cup starts against Italy in Manaus, six hours to bed in players and a system. The first of their four friendlies bequeathed more questions than answers. Why no Ben Foster in the second half? Why no Ross Barkley at all? Why James Milner when Hodgson knows all about him? Why was Wayne Rooney so lacking in influence?
The main question buzzing in observers’ minds was why on earth Hodgson started Sturridge out wide. England had not begun with so many Liverpool players since a 2-0 win in Luxembourg in 1977 when Ray Clemence, Emlyn Hughes, Ray Kennedy, Ian Callaghan and Terry McDermott started.
Hodgson selected Liverpool players but not their philosophy; there was little of the relentless pressing and swift counter-attacking that has made Brendan Rodgers’s side so thrilling to watch this season.
Hodgson’s 4-3-3 does not work with Rooney. England’s manager used a 4-3-3 system with Sturridge and Sterling wide and Rooney through the middle but they will surely look better in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Rooney behind Sturridge, Sterling on the right, somebody like Lallana drifting in from the left, and Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson holding.
England lacked Liverpool’s tempo but there were still signs of club understandings: Gerrard to Sterling, then Henderson cross-field to Sterling and then Sterling to Glen Johnson. It was the most starters from one club since 2001 and Albania away when Manchester United contributed Gary Neville, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Andy Cole. England actually finished with seven United players on the pitch after Teddy Sheringham and Wes Brown came on.
Ashley Cole made his international debut in Tirana, and was here fighting hard for his place at the World Cup. Cole’s intelligence, defensive expertise and enduring athleticism were unmistakable in the first 45 minutes, a period notable for a worrying moment when Wilshere briefly stayed down after a 50-50 with Daniel Agger. He was clearly in pain and the stretcher was called for. Wilshere eventually walked off and Lallana began sliding his shinguards into place.
Wilshere, a tough character, was determined to come back on. Surprisingly, Hodgson acquiesced. If Arsène Wenger was tuning in, it is hoped that he did not see it. It was pointless keeping Wilshere on and he was duly replaced by Lallana 10 minutes in the second period.
England were struggling to find fluidity or a cohesive threat. Rooney sent a free-kick over then failed to profit from a superb Sterling pass.
Denmark were decent enough, sadly deprived of the vision of the injured Christian Eriksen, but occasionally busy on the break. Johnson was beaten by Peter Ankersen but Chris Smalling cleared.
Sterling was continuing to climb higher up the steps on to the World Cup plane, tracking back and putting in a powerful tackle on Emil Larsen. Hart then dashed out to claim the ball ahead of Nicklas Bendtner, who had eluded Gary Cahill.
With six minutes of the half remaining, Denmark almost took the lead. Michael Krohn-Dehli released Jakob Poulsen but Hart closed down the angle and Cole cleared. Cole enjoyed a strong 45 minutes, running on to Rooney’s pass and crossing towards Sterling. Under pressure, Sterling still managed to manufacture a shot which hit the post.
England actually finished the half strongly and would have scored but for Kasper Schmeichel, whose father Peter was watching and had taken a selfie of the pair before kick-off. From a Rooney corner, Cahill headed down and Sturridge was presented with a great chance but was denied by Schmeichel, spreading himself in the handball starfish fashion made famous by his father.
Shaw sprinted on for his debut, soon parading his attacking side of his game by running on to Sterling’s pass and crossing low and hard. The 18-year-old then demonstrated his defensive qualities by dispossessing Kasper Kusk with a measure of strength and timing.
Hart had little to do in the England goal but reacted well after 65 minutes, rushing out to save from Morten Rasmussen and also dropping low to collect a shot from Bendtner. The focus swiftly turned back to Denmark’s keeper as the friendly became England versus Schmeichel for a while.
Sterling accelerated in from the left, finding Danny Welbeck who laid the ball back to Henderson before darting into the box. Henderson’s pass was delivered neatly through, inviting Welbeck, England’s No 28, to shoot but Schmeichel slid out to save. Shortly afterwards, Schmeichel frustrated Welbeck again.
Leicester City’s goalkeeper, who has been such an important part of Nigel Pearson’s promotion-chasing team, then reacted well to push Sturridge’s left-foot shot over.
Schmeichel was finally beaten when Lallana did superbly, twisting this way and that, before delivering a ball left-footed for Sturridge to head back across Schmeichel and in.
In keeping with Peters’s teaching, Sturridge used his head. But England will need more thought, more energy in Brazil. Olsen had a point.
