Eleven-time, five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao will appear together for the only time until fight week on March 11.
The news was confirmed yesterday that, ahead of their $250 million history-making championship showdown on Saturday, May 2 in Las Vegas, the two will likely trade barbs in Los Angeles in eight days' time.
The fight - which has been five years in the making, was finally confirmed on Feb 20 when Mayweather posted a photo of his signed contract on one of his social media platforms.

The American has this morning posted images of his first day of his official training camp at his Las Vegas gym as the countdown to the blockbuster gets underway.
How richest-ever fight was made
Mayweather added several pictures to the social media site shots.com on Monday night after his first session. Pacquiao, meanwhile, has also started training at Freddie Roach's Wild Card gym in Los Angeles.

His trainer Roach will not join up with him until next week as the 54-year-old is preparing for Zou Shiming's first world title fight against Amnat Ruenroeng in Macao on Saturday.
