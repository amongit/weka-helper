DJOKOVIC WINS AUSTRLIAN OPEN WITH 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 WIN OVER MURRAY
WRAP: After such a torrid 2014 it was a great effort for Murray to reach his eighth grand slam final and fourth in Melbourne. But it will be another case of what could've been for the British No 1 after letting Djokovic off the hook in the crucial third set when he was up a break at 2-0 and with Djokovic appearing to pick up a slight ailment with every point he lost. Despite putting in an incredible effort for two and a half sets, a sloppy service game allowed Djokovic back at 2-2 and a second break - this time courtesy of a double fault - allowed Djokovic to serve for the set at 5-3 and from that moment he never looked back. In fact, Djokovic managed to shake off his injury issues to win nine straight games and 12 of the last 13 to capture a fifth Australian Open title. Tactically, Murray looked on par with Djokovic but towards the end his energy levels sapped despite only dropping two sets heading into the final and had the embarrassing ordeal of suffering a 'bagel' in the fourth. Thanks for joining us.
12.38 Djokovic takes to the stage to recieve his fifth winners' trophy and goes through the pleasantries first.
"Tough luck Andy, you fight alot I wish you the best for the rest of the season. I want to congratulate you and Kim on your engagement and hope you have many kids. It's slightly different thinking for me now since I've become a dad and husband."

12.34 Murray steps up to receive his fourth runners-up trophy in Melbourne...and takes to the mic:
"I'd like to congratulate Novak on a fifth Australian title, it's thoroughly deserved."
He goes through the usually thank-yous and says: "It's been my most consistent grand slam tournament so thank you for your support. I couldn't quite do it tonight, but I've come closer than other years. It's amazing to play in front of these amazing players too so thanks for making it all special. I'll try and come back next year and have a slightly different outcome in the final."
Djokovic* 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-0 Murray Djokovic smashes home the opening point, just the three to go. Murray tries to keep up the fight by swatting a forehand down the line but Djokovic creeps back in front as Murray's energy levels take another nosedive. When Murray slaps into the net, Djokovic brings up two Championship points. Djokovic misses the first when he goes long, but wins a fifth Australian Open title when Murray can't make another return. Murray is rightly annoyed with himself. That was Djokovic's ninth game in a row, and he won 12 of the last 13. DJOKOVIC WINS FOURTH SET 6-0 TO BEAT MURRAY BY THREE SETS TO ONE TO CLINCH FIFTH AUSTRALIAN OPEN

Novak #Djokovic wins a fifth Australian Open championship #ausopen http://t.co/E95VHzOoDB
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 5-0 Murray* The game looks over for Murray as Djokovic moves a mini-break up. His body language has gone, he gets a point on the board but Djokovic eases to two break points. Murray challenges a ball on the line which landed flush on the baseline and Murray is on course to be 'bagelled' here. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 4-0 Murray A booming second set proves too good for Murray as Djokovic keeps up the charge by moving 30-15 up. Murray wildly lashes out at a forehand but manages to hang in the game when he makes Djokovic stretch for a return which he can't get back. Djokovic makes his first bad call in a while with a poor drop shot which Murray chases down with ease for deuce. But a cracking forehand into the advantage court after a body serve takes him to advantage. He leaps on a short return from Murray and it's a seventh straight game for the world No 1.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 3-0 Murray* Tiredness is well and truly creeping into Murray's game as the unforced errors count creep up and he clutches his thigh as he slaps another regulation forehand into the net. Djokovic with two break points, takes it on the first by moving into a second serve and striking a winner. One-way traffic now. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 2-0 Murray Murray's attempt to rush the net are given short shrift as Djokovic strikes a return back low and the Brit is unable to dig it out from under his feet. Djokovic is finding the lines again as he opens his body up to swing a forehand out wide for 40-15 but a classic point on the next brings out smiles from both men as a cheeky net drop allows Murray to dig the ball back only for Djokovic to send his rival scampering to the back of the court - but can only watch it go long. It doesn't matter as Djokovic takes the game on the next and gives a commanding and confident look to his corner.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 1-0 Murray* Murray hangs in one lengthy rally but then tiredness sets in and he strikes successive balls into the net to move 15-30 down. He forces Djokovic to go long on the next which sees the Serb produce an almighty groan but when a forehand flashes past Murray and lands flush on the baseline IT hands him an early break point. Murray throws in a second successive poor service game by hitting into the net and Djokovic has an early break. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 Murray Djokovic hits tamely into the net to hand Murray a lift but levels when Murray hits long. Another regulation forehand goes begging for Murray as Djokovic edges 30-15 up. Murray stares down at two set points and Djokovic wraps it up on the first when Murray shoots a forehand too long again. DJOKOVIC WINS THIRD SET TO MOVE TWO SETS TO ONE UP

Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 5-3 Murray* A sloppy start from Murray gives Djokovic a sniff at 30-0, Murray lets out a couple of complaints which appear to be aimed at his corner and it hasn't helped as Djokovic jumps on a short return and whips a forehand winner back for three break points. Murray saves one when he forces Djokovic to hit long and then throws in a double fault to hand Djokovic the break. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 4-3 Murray Murray senses an opportunity when he takes the opening point but then has to dig deep to pull level at 30-all with a smash at the net. He dances into a short return to punch a forehand winner to bring up a break point but Djokovic brilliantly saves it by stretching to produce a drop shot which Murray chases down, but hits into the post. Djokovic puts a comfortable smash away to steer his way to game point and then survives when Murray whacks into the net.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 3-3 Murray* A lucky net cord assists Murray as he brings Djokovic to net and the Brit drills a pass which Djokovic can't retrieve. Murray works Djokovic around the baseline on the next, delivering a forehand winner and a backhand winner brings up three game points. An ace brings up the game to love.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 3-2 Murray Djokovic is back in the groove, hitting his 15th forehand winner en route to moving 30-0 up. He tries another winner down the line, but it just curls into the tramlines and Murray digs in to draw level. Djokovic is breathing hard again as he edges to game point but it's a third game in a row for the Serb. Murray throws a few 'F' bombs as he retreats to his corner while handing out a few death stares.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 2-2 Murray* Djokovic has a spring back in his step after looping a service return back across court and then watching Murray strike an unforced error to move a mini-break up. Another slap into the net hands Djokovic two break points, Murray delivers a timely ace on the first and then hits a forehand into the tape to hand the world No 1 the break back. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 1-2 Murray Murray does the hard work by chasing down a drop shot only to fluff his lines and mess up his dinked return as Djokovic edges his way to 40-0. He wraps up a second straight game to love with a winner down the line.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7, 0-2 Murray* Djokovic appears to be having issues on every point he loses as Murray storms 40-0 up. The British No 1 just has to make sure he doesn't get side-tracked by what's happening over the other side of the court. A comfortable game to love.
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-7, 0-1 Murray Murray as he did against Kyrgios and Berdych looks to be able to mix up his strategies and play more than at any other slam. He edges 30-15 by moving Djokovic around the court and advancing to net to produce a winner and then move to two break points when Djokovic hits limply into the net. Djokovic whacks a forehand into the net and then falls theatrically to the court after losing the break. Was that a genuine slip-up? Looked to me that he made a meal of a return and then wanted to look like he had slipped. It doesn't matter, Murray breaks. MURRAY BREAKS.
Djokovic 7-6, 6-7 Murray Tie-break Murray opens up first on the breaker, unlike last time out, and delivers an ace which Djokovic disputes claiming that he heard a 'let' call. A brutal rally goes Murray's way when Djokovic pushes a return long, but Murray was in this position last time out. Murray steers his way to 3-1 and then 4-1 when Djokovic drags a backhand wide. The world No 1 whips a forehand into the corner which beats Murray hands down but after the change-around, Murray finally wears down Djokovic to edge 5-2 up and with two serves to his name. Murray brings up four set points by steering a return down the line but then over-eggs a regulation backhand by some distance. Not to worry, he has another three. Djokovic saves the next with a comfortable volley at the net, but he can't pick up Murray's return on the next and Murray is back in this match. MURRAY WINS THE TIE-BREAK 7-4 TO DRAW LEVEL AT ONE SET ALL
Djokovic* 7-6, 6-6 Murray Murray goes for the big 'un rather earlier than needed and is still blowing hard on the next point when he sends back to the base of the net. You wouldn't blame him for needing a breather as Djokovic eases to a comfortable game to love.
Djokovic 7-6, 5-6 Murray* A few more shout outs from the crowd - in Andy's favour - upset the rhythm of the game as Murray stutters with his first serve. He's forced to chase down a drop shot and then is sent scampering to the back of the court, but he needn't have worried as the ball goes long and now it's Murray's turn to shake his fist at the supporters - and that's just for 30-15 too. Djokovic slaps a cracking second service return right back down Murray's throat and when Djokovic sends Murray chasing down one forehand to pulls out an incredible forehand which is loaded with pace that even Usain Bolt could not chase it down. No worries, Murray sees off the break point chance when Djokovic hits a service return into the net and we're at deuce. Murray is struggling with his first serve for the first time in the match and Djokovic works his way to a second break point. The Serb misses the chance, dragging a cross-court shot wide but he's given a third opportunity when Murray can't lift a forehand back over the net from deep on the baseline. He saves it with a booming ace down the T which produces more fist-pumping and finally has game point when he sends a high-volley loaded with topspin into the corner. Murray finally holds when Djokovic hits long.
Djokovic* 7-6, 5-5 Murray Two hours gone on the clock and Murray continues his aggressive play, only to be passed at the net by Djokovic. Murray stays on the front foot on the next point, but sends a backhand volley just over the baseline but manages to drag his way back to 40-30 when he sends Djokovic from side-to-side and then works the space to send a volley into the deuce side. An error from Djokovic, hitting a return into Murray's path to execute a passing winner brings him back to deuce and from a comfortable position for Djokovic, he is now looking uneasy out there. Djokovic hits a forehand into the tramlines to gift Murray a set point but he slaps a regulation backhand into the net. A timely first serve gets Djokovic back in the groove, but when Murray passes him, we're back to a second deuce. Murray is pinned to the back of the court and left puffing and panting but Djokovic throws in another unforced error and this game has passed the eight-minute mark. Murray looks to be on the front foot, pinning Djokovic into the corner and just when it looks like Murray has produced the killer punch, he sends a forehand long. Djokovic finally holds when Murray hits into the tape. Djokovic lifts both arms to the crowd, the Serb's focus is well and truly back now.
Djokovic 7-6, 4-5 Murray* That unscheduled break of play has down the British No 1 the world of good as now Djokovic is feeling the strain and aggressively challenges one call by sticking up his finger, calm down Novak. Murray swats away a couple of returns from Djokovic at the net for three game points and he's edged his way back in front this set.
Djokovic* 7-6, 4-4 Murray Play is held up temporarily as security swoop on a banner which has been unveiled on Rod Laver, seemingly in protest against something, although not too clear for my eyes as the TV cameras pan away. That might have given Murray just enough time to regain his focus as Djokovic is still held up as security march away a couple of troublemakers. Murray makes a great pick up at the net which sees Djokovic rush the net, but Murray is able to put aawy a volley for the opening point. Djokovic replies with a slam-dunk of a smash, but is caught by a ball which skids off the line by Murray to trail 30-15. At 30-all some great deep returning from Murray forces Djokovic into an error and Murray has a break point shot. Murray shows great resilience to stay toe-to-toe with Djokovic in the next and works just enough space to punch a forehand into the corner, game on. MURRAY BREAKS.
Djokovic 7-6, 4-3 Murray* Djokovic makes it 13 straight points before Murray finally gets on the board when the Serb produces an error. Murray charges in on a short return from Djokovic and nearly sends a return long but Djokovic's challenge is over-ruled, much to Murray's relief. Djokovic steps into a second serve to slap a return which is too good for Murray. But the Brit finally gets over the line and ends Djokovic's three-game winning streak.
Djokovic* 7-6, 4-2 Murray Djokovic is starting to turn the screw now as Murray's lapse of concentration continues. A correct challenge when an ace on the line is called good sees the world No 1 seal the game to love. That's just the 12 points in a row for the Serb.
Djokovic 7-6, 3-2 Murray* Djokovic takes his point-winning sequence to six when Murray strikes a cross-court shot wide after another lengthy rally. Djokovic quickly makes it a seventh for three break points when his whipped return is hit into the feet of Murray on the baseline. Djokovic takes it on the first for his third straight game, sending down an overhead smash at the net and Murray's early break is soon forgotten about. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 2-2 Murray Djokovic swipes away a ball in anger after Murray moves a mini-break up. But it's Murray who starts berating himself, much to Djokovic's amusing when he can't get a simple forehand return back and we're back to 30-all. Mentally both players appear a little all over the place, Murray continues to let his focus waiver as he wildly hits a groundstroke wide and Djokovic wins a fourth-straight point for game, despite having to deal with a tricky sliced drop shot at the net.
Djokovic 7-6, 1-2 Murray* Djokovic toys with Murray, sending him back and forward before delivering a killer drop shot to draw level for 15-15. Djokovic squanders a chance at 30-15 when he sends a forehand wide when well-placed but Murray can't make the most of the let-off as Djokovic slices a drop shot to bring up his first break point of this set. Murray's first serve goes a wandering and when he slaps a return into the net, Djokovic has the break back. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 7-6, 0-2 Murray The Djokovic unforced errors count is slowly creeping up as he fails to get up and under a regulation forehand. Murray responds with an error of his own and then makes Djokovic work incredibly hard behind the baseline and forcing him to drag a return to the base of the net. Djokovic makes out he is still feeling the effects of an ankle injury as he stares at his corner after slapping into the net again to stare two break points down. He only needs one as Djokovic is caught flat-footed on the baseline. MURRAY BREAKS.
Djokovic 7-6, 0-1 Murray* Murray spent the interval giving himself a good talking too, you'll remember he did that in private the US Open final in the toilets which inspired him to victory over Djokovic that day. He starts off strongly this second set, pinning Djokovic behind the baseline and taking his opportunities. Djokovic is worn down on the next rally, hitting into the net and then crumbling to the blue surface after jarring his angle. Murray doesn't allow it to distract him and he wraps up the game.

Djokovic 7-6 Murray Tie-break Djokovic throws in a first double fault of the match at the start of the tie-break and Murray turns it into a mini-break by pouncing on his rival. Murray can't make it a third-straight point as he sends a lob well past the baseline and Djokovic moves back to 2-2 when he slaps a backhand winner across court. Djokovic shows signs of nerves creeping in as he over-eggs another return and Murray has his two serves now to turn the screw. Another ding-dong of a rally goes Murray's way and the two change ends with the British No 1's tail up and a 4-2 advantage. A first double fault from Murray gifts Djokovic a free point and the Serb hangs in the next rally to draw level for four-all. Murray drives one return too long to give Djokovic the lead for the first time in the breaker but a strong first serve sets him up nicely and he's at the net in a flash and hits a winner to draw back to five-all. Murray switches from defence to attack, and then defence to attack again before he pushes one return agonishingly long of the baseline to hand Djokovic a first set point. Djokovic sees a challenge over-ruled on his first serve but then Murray slaps the second serve into the tape and after 72 minutes, Djokovic clinches the opener. DJOKOVIC WINS THE FIRST SET AFTER CLINCHING TIE-BREAK 7-5
Djokovic 6-6 Murray* Murray serves strongly to keep Djokovic on the back foot for 30-0 and then brings up three game points by working Djokovic out wide and then advancing to net and showing soft hands to execute a drop shot. It's another love game for Murray. Tie-break time.
Jonathan Liew on Rod Laver has this little update:
Djokovic has been stretching his back quite gingerly in between points. He just berated a ball boy for throwing a ball to him rather than placing them on his racquet. Might be a bit of mind games, but Djokovic doesn't quite look right.
Djokovic* 6-5 Murray Djokovic's concentration levels have been massively affected by that slight tweak of the thumb and being broken for a second time this set. After losing a fifth straight point, he finally picks himself up and gets back on track, sending down an ace for 40-15 and goes on to wrap up the game. Djokovic's injury, meanwhile, looks like it's a burst blister on his thumb, ouchy. Murray retreats to his chair slightly aggrieved at apparent movement in the tunnel. There's much flapping on the court as they try and make amends.
Djokovic 5-5 Murray* Djokovic vents at the umpire for a shout out during the last game after being been seen by the trainer. The world No 1 is rattled here and has just seen his level drop the last game or so. He attempts a crafty drop shot on the opening point which has Murray scappering to the net, but it drops into the net. He then uncharacteristically throws in a sloppy forehand and then hits long on the next, gifting Murray three game points. It's a first game to love as Djokovic can't can't muster a return over the net.
Djokovic* 5-4 Murray Djokovic has called for the trainer at the end of this game to see to his strained thumb. He desperately hangs in one rally at 15-15 and manages incredibly to switch from defence to attack with a series of lobs which forces Djokovic back and sets up Murray for the winner. He was down and out that point. Murray steps up his level again on the next, working the angles and finding the room to squeeze a backhand winner down the line to bring you two break points. Murray injects a bit of pace at the right time to catch Djokovic cold behind the baseline and delivers a killer punch and he's broken back again, incredible scenes! MURRAY BREAKS.
Djokovic 5-3 Murray* Murray gets away with a slower second serve to sneak 30-0 up but sends one looping return just long of the baseline to allow Djokovic back in. He keeps his range on the next, but after much-squeaking of footwear, Murray can't lift a backhand over the net. Murray lures Djokovic to the net on the next point and looks to have paseed him - but the ball clips the tape and lands agonishingly into the tramlines as Djokovic slips at the net. Murray saves the break point when Djokovic over-eggs a second serve return and brings out a first 'come on' from Andy. Back to deuce and Murray stares at a second break point this game when he strikes long. Djokovic appeared to have done something to his thumb during that last point. He gives it a wiggle before settling down again and then wraps up a second break this set. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 4-3 Murray Murray hangs in a couple of rallies in the hope that Djokovic will blink first and incredibly, he actually does to give Murray an lead at 15-30. Djokovic panics on the next, rushing the net and is caught in no man's land in the middle of the court. Murray has two break points, what can he do here? He's forced to go long after missing his timing on a deep second serve and berates himself for a missed chance. No worries, he has a second. Djokovic misses another first serve, Murray hangs back then makes his move, he sets himself up well with a patient build up but then sends a forehand spinning into the tramlines. Not to worry, Djokovic slaps into the net to hand Murray a sixth break point chance overall this match. A sliced exchange later and Djokovic can't lift another return over the line and Murray is back in this first set. MURRAY BREAKS.
Djokovic 4-2 Murray* Murray slows things down and tries to break the Djokovic momentum. He's given a let-off at 30-15 when Djokovic hits wide picking up a short return from Murray. It's about the first error he's made of the match. The Serb is back on him in a flash, rushing the net again to draw back to 40-30. Great play from Murray on the next point sees the Brit work his opponent from side to side and just creates enough space to strike the winner. Djokovic responds with a polite tap on his racket. Good job, good job.
Djokovic* 4-1 Murray The world No 1 is looking every inch the best player on the planet, finding the corners with ease and striking some very clean winners. A few shouts of 'Go on Andy' cry out on Rod Laver to help lift the Brit, but Djokovic keeps them quiet by wrapping up the game with an ace and a winner into the corner again. A majestic start from the Serb, Murray hasn't done too much wrong. Haven't we heard that one before?
Djokovic 3-1 Murray* Djokovic is starting to pick off a few winners, slapping a forehand into the corner from a good few yards behind the baseline himself. Murray mixes things up with a kick-serve but Djokovic is into the rally in a flash, rushing the net and whipping a forehand winner back for 0-30. Murray tries to inject pace in the next exchange, but Djokovic again steps up to the plate and drills a forehand down the line from out wide. What can Djokovic do with three break points? He squanders the first (like Murray did), but whips a service winner across court for the first break of the match. DJOKOVIC BREAKS.
Djokovic* 2-1 Murray A forehand winner is folowed up by a deep backhand which Djokovic can't return to hand the British No 1 a mini-break. Murray has started very positively here and steps into a forehand and sends it into the corner for three break points. He misses the first chance, but stays toe-to-toe with Djokovic on the next only for the Serb to pick up a volley at the net after a rally of 27 strokes. A third break point goes begging when Murray slaps a return into the tape. Djokovic wins a fourth straight point with an ace down the middle and pulls off the great escape when he works his way to the net again and dispatches a winner which is too good for Murray.
Djokovic 1-1 Murray* Early doors it seems like the crowd are split in which camp they are backing. Muray again shows his aggressive side, forcing Djokovic deep and advancing to the net to put away a volley in unorthodox fashion for 30-0. Djokovic pegs Murray back when he makes the most of a short second serve and gets his nose in front in the rally. A correct challenge from Djokovic forces Murray to replay a point, but he fails with a successive challenge which gives Murray a sniff of the game. Murray hesitates over a second serve and again it's Djokovic who has the early advantage, luring the Brit to the net and forcing him across court and wide for deuce. Murray responds with a first ace of the match down the T and backs it up with another strong first serve.
Djokovic* 1-0 Murray (*denotes server) Murray is given a lift from the off, getting on the front foot and forcing Djokovic into the net for the opening point. Djokovic edges back in front with a backhand winner inside the tramlines, smashes a return into the advantage side for game point and puts away a volley at the net for the first game.
08.41 Nice touch from Kim Sears!

Your grand slam champion: Kim Sears. The rest of you can go home. pic.twitter.com/n3ucq4JXIq
08.34 Djokovic wins the toss and decides to serve first. The warm-up begins. Say cheese...

08.30 Here come the players. Murray heads down the tunnel in front of Djokovic. They have to carry their own bags onto Rod Laver, I think I'm right in saying that at Wimbledon they have an assitant to help out with their rackets and stuff on final's day. There that's Wimbledon 1 Australian Open 0. The players are given an equally warm welcome as they appear under the lights and gloomy skies. Currently is's 18c out there, just right.
08.29 Is this mind games from Murray heading into today's final?
I'm treating the match like I'm the underdog. I think I've only won one of our last eight meetings.
08.26 The women's final had a brief hold up for rain yesterday, the expectation is that rain will arrive at some point this evening in Melbourne which could see the roof closed and the match finishing indoors. The organisers have stressed how keen they are for the final to remain 'outdoors'.
08.15 Just as we wait for the players to enter the Rod Laver Arena, here's a little snippet of our tennis correspondent Simon Briggs' preview:
Victory in the Australian Open final this morning would admit Murray to a very exclusive group. If we leave out the four immortals who have achieved the career grand slam in the open era, that leaves 11 men who have ticked off three of the four landmarks.
Those players include the likes of Pete Sampras, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and indeed the Scot’s opponent today, Djokovic. It is not a bad club of which to be a member.
Even if we leave the big picture to one side for a minute, this is a huge occasion in the context of the tennis year. The Australian Open tends to function as a springboard for the season.
Read the full preview here...
08.00 Morning all. Well after DjokoStan III didn't live up to expectations during Friday's semi-final, what about the latest in the DjokoMuzza triology in Melbourne?
Murray has failed in his two previous attempts to conquer Novak Djokovic at the 2011 and 2013 Australian Open finals - but that was back in the day before he'd got a slam to his name so he faces the world No 1 on very different terms today.
Murray has even been made favourite in some quarters. Who are you backing and what are your predictions for this morning's clash. Can you see it going all the way?
My prediction is for Murray to win in four. He'll go two-love up, be bagelled in the third but come back strongly to win over four. Optimistic? Yes. Get involved and email me your predictions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Murray has said he is "feeling good" as he prepares to take to court in his attempt to win a third grand slam title.
The British No 1 faces Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final this morning in what will be the third meeting between the men for the trophy.
The former Wimbledon and US Open champion appeared relaxed in the build up to the match as he took part in a press conference in Melbourne.
"Yeah, I feel good," he said. "I felt good after all of the matches and recovered fairly well from the two fairly long matches.
"I know it's going to be extremely difficult to win the match. I know if I want to win, it will probably be very, very tough and challenging physically. So I need to prepare myself mentally for that.
"But he has a fantastic record here. He obviously loves the court and the conditions. And, yeah, it would be a big upset if I manage to win."
The 27-year-old has reached the Australian Open final three times before, losing twice to Djokovic in 2011 and 2013 and once to Roger Federer in 2010.
After falling down the world rankings in 2014, Murray has returned to form this year and has been quick to praise coach Amelie Mauresmo.
The match against Djokovic will be Murray's eighth grand slam final and as he continues to make British tennis history, he was asked where he rates himself in the "pantheon of British sport" and who he thinks is the best of all time.
He said: "Well, yeah, I definitely wouldn't say that would be me. I wouldn't say that would be the case at all. But, I mean, in terms of the sports I follow a lot, sports that I have a lot of respect for, I mean, someone like a Joe Calzaghe, what he did in boxing is incredible and extremely rare.
"I don't know, like a Rory McIlroy is an incredible talent and will probably go on to do amazing things for the rest of his career. I don't know how far exactly you want to go back. But Lewis Hamilton, what he's done has also been amazing.
"I just know like for myself that the time I'm competing in just now is extremely challenging. Yeah, anything I achieve, I'm very proud of because of the players that I'm competing against currently. So, yeah, that's how I feel about it."
