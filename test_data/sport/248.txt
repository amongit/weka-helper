Paul Butler comes up short as Zolani Tete knocks him out after eight-round masterclass of skill and power

‘The Baby-Faced Assassin’ Paul Butler failed in his bid to become the 10th British fighter to win world titles in two weight divisions, and the first Briton for over a hundred years to step down a weight and win a second world title last night at the Liverpool Echo Arena.
Butler was no match for champion Zolani Tete, from South Africa, who put on a boxing masterclass to stop the Ellesmere Port fighter in the eighth round, stepping inside with a sweet uppercut which floored the challenger to end the fight.
Tete revealed afterwards that he would be spending his winnings on buying his mother a new leg. “I’m dedicating this fight to my mother,” said Tete, who retained the International Boxing Federation super-flyweight title, and moved to 20 wins to go with his three losses. This was Butler’s first defeat in his 18th fight.
Both men had claimed this week that they would break the heart of the other by the eighth round, and Tete’s prediction proved prophetic. His height, 72in reach, and jab from the southpaw stance allowed him dominated the fight for the first half of the 12 championship rounds, the champion looking every inch a world class fighter.
There was seemingly little Butler could do to break the control of the defending champion, whose performance was nothing short of exceptional. Tete won every one of the eight rounds, with Butler unable to solve the riddle posed by his lanky opponent, who had a five-inch height and reach advantage. Tete’s command of range was impeccable.

“There wasn’t a lot I could do, it wasn’t my best, but he’s a great champion,” said the former world bantamweight champion Butler, 26, afterwards.
Tete showed from the opening bell that his pawing jab from the southpaw stance would keep Butler at bay. Dictating the fight from the centre of the ring in the third, the 5ft 9ins tall 115lbs champion from South Africa took the first three rounds with ease.
“Get on top of him,” said trainer Arnie Farnell between rounds to Butler. But the fourth round proved just as difficult for the Ellesmere Port fighter to get inside. So it continued, round after round, with Butler unable to create any pressure.
An uppercut and a straight left early in the eighth from Tete was followed by a brutal uppercut midway through the round, which floored Butler, who failed to make the count, referee Phil Edwards stopping the fight.
