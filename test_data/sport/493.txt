Super Bowl 2015 halftime show: how Katy Perry helped Missy Elliott get her freak on

Once a year, a vast chunk of the country sits down to watch the Super Bowl together. They stand up, place their hands over their hearts and sing the national anthem together. They watch the commercials together. They cheer or boo the first half of the game together and at half-time, when the spectacular entertainment segment begins, they take a giant "bathroom break" together.
For decades, the 12-minute Super Bowl half-time show has been designed to dazzle the fans in the stadium and the viewing millions with showgirls, brass bands, comedy, magic and adult contemporary balladeers. It wasn’t until the start of the 21st century that the NFL seemed to realise the biggest audience of the TV year (the 2014 Super Bowl attracted 110 million viewers) could be exploited in a way that didn't involve boring them to death.

Since 2000, the Super Bowl half-time show — sorry, the Pepsi Super Bowl Half-Time Show — has alternated between tried-and-trusted classic rockers such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty, and pop stars, both current and vintage, including Bruno Mars, Black Eyed Peas, Beyoncé and Madonna.
Prince’s 2007 show was probably the best half-time show in Super Bowl history. The most memorable half-time appearance came from Janet Jackson’s unexpectedly unveiled nipple at the climax of the 2004 show.

When Katy Perry was announced as the featured performer at the 49th Super Bowl, America’s reaction was unanimous: “Why not Taylor Swift?”
Aren’t cheerleaders across the universe flipping and tumbling to Shake It Off? Perry, with her kindergarten burlesque empowerment anthems seemed like a poor substitute.
Her opening song, the ruthlessly efficient but intolerable Roar, saw her riding a huge puppeteered tiger across the stadium. This, to me, summed up Katy Perry: she works hard at being fun. She raced through selections from her ever-swelling Greatest Hits catalogue, reducing Lenny Kravitz to her fake-rock accessory for I Kissed A Girl.

That Missy Elliott would also make a cameo appearance was widely known. What I didn’t expect was that Perry would give the long-absent, much-missed Missy the space and time to perform Get Your Freak On, Work It and Lose Control.
OK, she was doing it because she needed the time to pull off a costume change — her fourth! — and attach herself to some complicated rigging, but still, that was an extraordinarily generous gesture from an established artist to one who has faded from view.
Being reminded of how great and innovative Missy was at her mid-2000s peak left me in somewhat vulnerable state of mind.
When Perry launched into her closing song, the one about feeling like a plastic bag, and she was flown across the length of the stadium while pyrotechnics exploded, I might have found myself becoming just a tiny bit emotional...
