Six Nations 2015: Wales wing George North suffered three 'massive' blows to the head

Two years ago George North scored the decisive try in Paris as Wales secured a surprising 16-6 victory that began the trek to the RBS Six Nations Championship title after defeat at home by Ireland in the opening round.
What was even more surprising, shocking even, was that North’s father, David, ran on to the field to celebrate with his son after the try. That sort of thing is just not supposed to happen these days. Apparently it will not be happening again this evening either. North Snr has been banished to the upper sections of Stade de France.
“I’ve ordered tickets for my family but my old man is up the top,” said North Jnr. “My mam and my sister are at the front but my dad is in the top right-hand corner. If I score and he manages to get down from there, I’ll be impressed.”
North has been in the headlines often recently after his concussion episodes against England in Cardiff — “as has been well-documented, it has been interesting,” he says with a grin – but today he is happy that the story is about him becoming the youngest player, at 22, to reach 50 Test caps, an extraordinary achievement.
That is, of course, not 50 caps for Wales, but rather 47 for them and three for the British and Irish Lions. “I’ve had a lot of kind wishes and I’m very proud, but the big one will be when I get 50 caps for Wales.”

Speaking about the concussion for the first time, North said: “At the end of the day it is rugby, isn’t it? It’s not table tennis or tiddlywinks, it is a contact sport and you are going to get some bangs and unfortunately they were on my chin.”
North admits to initial frustration at being left out of Wales’s recent win in Scotland before common sense reigned. “I was passing all the tests and I was symptom-free from minute one,” he said. “ I was up for selection so your initial thoughts when not being picked are that you are gutted. But then you sit down with the doctor and with Gats [Warren Gatland] and they explain it is more for my welfare, having had that massive blow in the autumn series [against New Zealand], and having the two blows in the [England] game. The neurologist reckons I had a third one from falling from 6ft 5in to the deck. In hindsight it was the right decision.”
North returns to the Wales side today, with Alex Cuthbert dropping out, simply because Liam Williams’s performance at Murrayfield was too good for him to be omitted.

Samson Lee’s restoration to tighthead prop, also after concussion, was predictable too, but less foreseeable were calls for hooker Scott Baldwin and lock Luke Charteris in place of Richard Hibbard and Jake Ball.
Hibbard’s omission is a clear indication that there can be no complacency in the Wales camp. While Wales’s line-out has been poor – thus Charteris’s summons as well – Hibbard has not been the force he usually is around the field.
Remarkably France have not scored a try in their past four matches against Wales – and only one in this championship so far – thus surely influencing coach Philippe Saint-André’s selections for today.
He makes five changes, with Romain Taofifénua replacing the suspended Pascal Papé and Sofiane Guitoune and Morgan Parra replacing the stricken Teddy Thomas and Rory Kockott at wing and scrum-half respectively.
But it is at centre and full-back where Saint-André’s intentions are manifested, with Rémi Lamerat and Brice Dulin replacing Mathieu Bastareaud and Scott Spedding.
“We know what Bastareuad is good at and he’s been quite effective for France,” says Wales assistant coach Rob Howley. “But maybe it’s an indication they are going to play more rugby and wider out.”
Wales will not lack for inside knowledge of the French players, with five of their match-day squad based in France – Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Jamie Roberts, Mike Phillips and Charteris (all Racing Metro).
On Thursday morning those players addressed the rest of the squad. “It was good,” said Howley. “It gave us an insight, maybe as well as into the physical strengths and weaknesses, technical and tactical ability, also the psychological mindset of French players.”
Centre Davies was especially helpful as France’s 8, 9, 10 and 12 combination of Damien Chouly, Parra, Camille Lopez and Wesley Fofana all play for Clermont.
“Fofana is an exceptional centre and Jonathan Davies has given us a valuable insight,” said Howley. “Their 8, 9, 10 is important and they have that Clermont mix.”
Wales are looking for their first set of four straight victories against France since the 1950s, but, as Howley says, “you are always on your guard against them”.
Having already lost to England, Wales’s championship is over should they lose on Saturday. Ditto France, having lost to Ireland.
Neither side have been anywhere near their best thus far. It is time for one of them to step up.
