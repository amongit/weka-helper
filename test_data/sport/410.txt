Roberto Mancini given more time to explain his criticism of referee in Manchester City's defeat by Sunderland

Comments
The Manchester City manager made a request, which the Football Association has granted, to be given more time to outline his position because of the heavy demands of the Christmas fixture programme.
Mancini could be warned, fined or suspended from the touchline after he suggested Friend “maybe ate too much for Christmas” during the 1-0 defeat at Sunderland.
The Italian felt his side should have been awarded a free kick in the build-up to Adam Johnson’s winning goal.
Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp has already replied to the FA with his explanation for comments about referee Chris Foy and his assistant during the 2-1 defeat against West Bromwich Albion on the same day.
The FA’s disciplinary unit is considering Redknapp’s response.

Senior figures at City have claimed to be “astonished” that the FA had taken moves to censure Mancini while appearing to overlook the conduct of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson during the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle, when the Scot appeared to harangue referee Mike Dean and his assistant Jake Collin.
Dean did not penalise Ferguson at the time nor report the incidents, which means the United manager escapes a charge.
The issue with Mancini is the perception that he cast doubt on Friend’s fitness and ability to officiate.
In November 2009, Ferguson was issued with a four-match touchline ban – with two games suspended – and fined £20,000 for comments questioning the fitness and ability to officiate of referee Alan Wiley during a 2-2 draw at home to Sunderland a month earlier.
Ferguson was found guilty of improper conduct after claiming Wiley was “not fit enough for a game of that standard”.
Depending on his explanation for the comments about Friend, Mancini could face a similar charge from the FA and receive a warning, fine or worse if he is found guilty.
