When this narrow scoreline is inscribed in the Champions League history books, it needs to be accompanied by an asterisk denoting the influence of Joe Hart.
Manchester City are out of Europe and were lucky it was not a rout. Only the greatest performance of Hart’s career rescued City from an almighty mauling.

In truth, there can be no real silver lining found in another chastening departure from Europe, and the doubts are deepening around Manuel Pellegrini’s future. Barring goalkeeping, City were second-best in all departments to Barcelona, including the dug-out where Pellegrini again struggled to convince he can come up with a game-plan for Europe or inspire his players in adversity.
For all the criticism directed at Pellegrini, an equally legitimate debate revolves around who would replace him. Pep Guardiola was watching on here, sitting in with the Barcelona fans on his first return to the Nou Camp since resigning three years ago. City would love to employ his high-class services but he is committed to another year at Bayern Munich.
Hart-stopper: Joe Hart was superb, but his performance was ultimately fruitless
The theme of the evening in Catalonia was actually not Pellegrini under pressure but the positives of Hart and Lionel Messi, marveling at their contrasting gifts. Admiration grew and grew for City’s remarkable keeper. Having stopped a penalty from Messi in the first leg, Hart proceeded to deny the little Argentinian magician again while also thwarting Luis Suarez and particularly Neymar. It was the Shropshire lad versus the South America all-stars.
Hart made seven superb saves and had no chance with Ivan Rakitic’s 31st-minute goal, having been left exposed by his defence and midfield. It should have been the signal for a real shoeing, and Barcelona quickly saw even more gaps opening the way to City’s goal, but Hart blocked the way.
Poor old Neymar kept running through, and kept being denied by the hands or feet of a 27-year-old Englishman. Suarez, sportingly, embraced Hart after one save and was first to shake his hand at the final whistle. Hart was last to leave the field at the end, being serenaded as “England’s No 1” by the 4,000 away fans.
• Barcelona vs Manchester City: as it happened
As he approached the tunnel, Hart was hugged by the waiting Xabier Mancisidor, City’s goalkeeping coach. They had worked hard preparing for this game, for the individual threats of such a stellar front-line. They analysed how Neymar, Suarez and Messi like to finish, although as Hart pointed out last week, Messi’s intentions are impossible to predict. Of the many moments of pride in his career, Hart can reflect on the fact that he faced Messi over three hours and did not yield.
Hart did not bow to Messi, Suarez or Neymar here even though his defence was porous, even though his team are suffering a crisis of confidence, even though questions mount over the stewardship of Pellegrini. The Chilean deserves credit for his adept handling of Hart’s loss of form last season, resting him, bringing in Willy Caballero and placing pressure on the Englishman, who has responded so positively.
Flagging: Barca fans create a spectacle before kick-off
This was a demonstration of the art of protecting a goalmouth so accomplished, so full of anticipation and athleticism, that it even eclipsed Hart’s prowess in the draw with Borussia Dortmund on Oct 4, 2012. The tale of that tie was Hart stopped Mario Gotze three times, smothered a strike from Ilkay Gundogan, then pushed away another swerving special from Gotze, conceded to Marco Reus but then denied him with his feet, diverted a curling strike from Gundogan before finishing by thwarting Robert Lewandowski.
That was good. This was better. Expert appraisal came from the England goalkeeper, Jack Butland, who tweeted “what a game Joe Hart had, great display of showing how you can put pressure on the attacker in 1v1 situations! make them doubt themselves!”
Messi is not a creature who seems plagued by doubt. If the second-half focus was primarily on Hart’s reflexes, the first half had been all about Messi. Gary Lineker, the distinguished former England international, suggested via social media that the argument was over, that Messi was the greatest footballer ever. Broadening the historical context, removing the debate from the here and now, Messi still has to climb above the achievements of two legends. Diego Maradona’s goals and all-round genius drove good-but-not-great sides to Serie A and the World Cup. Pele won three World Cups.
See you later: Lionel Messi glides away from James Milner
Messi deserves celebrating as one of the greatest ever, certainly in the top five of all time with Cristiano Ronaldo meriting similar reverence. The modern obsession with lists, of demanding a pecking order, should just be set aside and these special talents, Messi and Ronaldo, be enjoyed. It is a privilege to be watching football in the age of Messi and Ronaldo.
That reality makes it even more bizarre that the Nou Camp was still advertising tickets, albeit for an excessive €175, in the run-up to the game. The chance to catch Messi in his pomp has to be seized. The half-time statistics revealed Messi touched the ball 56 times, had three efforts on goal, and one assist.
Up in the Gods, where the oxygen was thin, and the confidence thinner, City’s fans peered down, straining to pick out the human ants speeding around below. At least it was easy to spot Messi; he tended to be the one with the ball.
Close thing: Lionel Messi sends a free-kick just over the bar
He was not involved in an early Barcelona attack, culminating in Neymar hitting the post, but was soon running the show. If there was an award for European Golden Nutmeg, Messi was surely racing clear with the number of times he guided the ball between opponents’ legs. Fernandinho, then James Milner suffered the indignity. Some would call it an honour.
As the Barcelona supporters chorused “Messi, Messi”, the Argentine almost scored a wonderful first-half goal following a move of quickfire return passes. He passed to Neymar, and received the ball back. He passed in to Andres Iniesta, and collected the return, being denied brilliantly by Hart.
City had rare excursions out of their half. Yaya Toure cut the ball back to Milner, whose shot was blocked by Dani Alves. Aleksandar Kolarov had a shot held by Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Sergio Aguero, a frequently isolated frontrunner, had a shot intercepted by Gerard Pique.
Opener: Ivan Rakitic lifts the ball over Joe Hart for Barcelona's opening goal
Normal service was always resumed, normal Barcelona possession, pushing deep into City territory. As he looked on helplessly, Pellegrini’s side were creaking, their indiscipline surfacing, bringing frequent bookings and the pressure soon told.
After 31 minutes, Messi bamboozled Milner and Kolarov before lifting a great pass over City’s retreating back-line. City had been drawn across, Bacary Sagna going with Neymar, leaving tempting space towards the far-post. None of City’s midfielders had tracked Rakitic, who ran in and lifted the ball over Hart.
Joe Hart's saves in red, and the one that beat him in yellow
The fouls continued. Toure kicked Suarez. Samir Nasri hacked at Neymar. The chances continued. Suarez shot past Hart but struck the post. At times in the second half it felt that Hart was facing Barcelona on his own. He saved once from Iniesta and then three times from Messi, the third by diving at his feet, a manoeuvre requiring perfect timing. He rushed out to frustrate Neymar, this time with his feet.
City’s hopes were fading and disappeared when Sergio Aguero, having won a debatable penalty when taking evasive action from Pique, placed his kick too close to Ter Stegen. Down the other end, Hart continue to perform miracles in keeping the score down, denying Neymar in another one-on-one, and then somehow repelling a close-range shot from Messi.
Sergio Aguero's penalty is saved
Again Neymar ran through. Again, Hart stood firm. Hart finally prevented Suarez from bringing more sense to the scoreline. City went out but Hart left the Nou Camp with his head held high.
