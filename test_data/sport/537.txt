Lewis Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian Grand Prix

So towering was Lewis Hamilton’s victory here the world champion almost rose above Mr. Universe as he surveyed the pretenders to his throne after the Australian Grand Prix. Standing on top of the podium, Arnold Schwarzenegger to his left, even The Terminator felt small.
“I thought you were taller,” Hamilton joked. “I’m not wearing my high heels,” was Schwarzenegger’s quick-witted reply. Neither was the rest of Formula One. Hamilton - the cyborg assassin, the undisputed governor of F1, the phenomenal athlete - obliterated the opposition with machine-like precision. Pole position, fastest lap, chequered flag. Job done.
Do not let the margin of victory over his team-mate Nico Rosberg – 1.3 seconds – fool you. This was taken at a canter. Every time the German attempted to claw back ground, chipping away a few tenths here and there, Hamilton instantly reasserted himself. The eyes glowed red behind the visor and the timing screens lit up.

Hamilton had his rival and a 34th career victory in his pocket as soon as the five lights went out. We should not be surprised – it was the sort of form he showed at times on his way to 11 victories and the title last term.
Nearly four months have passed since Hamilton was crowned a two-time champion in Abu Dhabi yet very little seems to have changed. Nicole Scherzinger, his popstar ex-girlfriend, is no longer at his side, but unlike in years gone by it has had no noticeable impact on his racing whatsoever.
If anything, his supremacy over Rosberg, not to mention the rest of the field, has deepened, perhaps substantially. Hamilton is well on the way to making himself indestructible.
Arnold Schwarzenegger put the podium questions to Lewis Hamilton
The last time Hamilton opened his title defence here in the festival atmosphere of Melbourne’s Albert Park, in 2009, he began in a McLaren which was woefully slow and ended with his integrity in question after misleading the stewards. This was a far more serene way to his open his account for the year.
Still beaming after the “honour” of meeting Schwarzenegger, Hamilton explained: “By no means was it easy but I felt comfortable. I had the pace if I needed to respond. Once you’ve got a two-second gap, you try to manage that, there’s no need to eke out more. But when Nico turned up the heat I was able to react, which was good. Otherwise, it was a phenomenal race for both of us.”
Rosberg simply had to concede he had lost to the better man. “Lewis has done a fantastic job this weekend,” the 29-year-old said. “He drove like a world champion, so I couldn't quite beat him but for sure I was trying every single lap, all the way to the maximum, and I will do all year. I will give him a big run for his money and hopefully beat him.”
For all his talk of fighting to the end, of taking the championship to Hamilton, Rosberg appears like a man worryingly short of ideas to truly make this a memorable contest. Perhaps we are judging too soon, with 19 races still to go, but the onus is on the German to disturb the formbook of 2014.

It was a worrying prelude to the season for the rest of the sport. Sebastian Vettel’s debut for Ferrari ended with a creditable third but, alarmingly, the German was still more than half a minute adrift from the victor. Cue misery in the paddock and instant calls for a change to the rules. Formula One must not be too hasty, remembering that there have been dull season-openers before. But for the meantime we are relying on Rosberg to make this a compelling narrative.
As glorious as this was for Hamilton, you would struggle to deny that the enthusiastic crowd here were not served up a feast of motor racing. For starters, just 15 cars made the grid. Valtteri Bottas could not race for Williams with a back problem while Manor were still battling software issues. The minnows continue to face persistent accusations that they came to Melbourne with almost no chance of competing simply to fulfil their contract and collect their prize money, but the team escaped a stewards’ investigation without rebuke.
To make matters worse, both Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat broke down on their way to the grid. It had been expected of McLaren, laughably slow with their unreliable Honda engine, but it was a surprise to see Red Bull struggle so badly. The recriminations for Renault will be long after producing a power pack both slower and less driveable than at the end of last season.

Once the depleted field got away, Hamilton was on autopilot. Apart from a tangle at the first corner, which sent Pastor Maldonado into the wall, there wasn’t much to see behind. Remarkably, Jenson Button made it to the end, while rookies Felipe Nasr (fifth for Sauber after a week of courtroom drama) and Max Verstappen (retired with an engine failure) impressed on debut.
But in truth it was all Hamilton. There was only one way to end a perfect day. “I’ll be back,” he and Schwarzenegger declared in unison. The rest had better hope a weaker version of Hamilton returns for Malaysia.
