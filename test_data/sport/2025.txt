LaMichael James To 49ers With 61st Pick In 2nd Round In 2012 NFL Draft
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers have selected Oregon running back LaMichael James with the 61st overall pick of the NFL draft in the second round, adding depth behind Frank Gore.

San Francisco has made two surprising picks so far, getting James on Friday night to join Gore, Kendall Hunter and newly acquired Brandon Jacobs on the reigning NFC West champions. The Niners chose Illinois wide receiver A.J. Jenkins with the No. 30 pick in the first round Thursday.

James — also a reliable returner — rushed for 5,082 yards and 53 touchdowns on 771 career carries in three seasons with the Ducks.

He had 49 carries for 382 yards and four TDs in two games against Jim Harbaugh's Stanford team before Harbaugh jumped to the Niners last year.
