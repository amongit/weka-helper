Colorado senior guard elects to skip CBI tournament
BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado senior guard Askia Booker has informed coach Tad Boyle he won't be playing in the College Basketball Invitational.
The Buffaloes will be without their leader in scoring, assists and steals when they host Gardner-Webb on Wednesday.
Boyle told the school's website that he respects Booker's decision and ''we'll move on.'' Colorado finished 15-17 this season, ending a streak of three straight NCAA Tournament appearances.
Booker's choice not to suit up has led to some criticism on social media. Boyle warned Booker that could be the case, telling him, ''you'll take some heat with this decision.''
Boyle also said on the website that Booker's welcome anytime because he's ''part of our basketball family and always will be.''
