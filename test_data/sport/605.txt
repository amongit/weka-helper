A flurry of cycling-enthusiasts busy themselves between Lycra-clad rails, embracing the first opportunity to inspect Hoy's latest venture. Sir Chris Hoy has just unveiled his new clothing range, in collaboration with Volpine, at The London Bike Show in the Excel Arena.
Unsurprisingly, everyone seems pretty impressed - and really, who wouldn't trust the offshoot of a six-time Olympic gold medal winner?

"All of the products are tested and approved by Chris," Dave Hemming, head of sales at Volpine tells me.
"He'll go out and ride in the product and then send it back to us with feedback. He's very involved with the brand- we talk to him every couple of days and have a sit down meeting to discuss progress once a month."

And the prices are all reasonable too.
"We wanted to create clothes that would fit with Chris's bike range. The average bike is around £600 so it made no sense to produce a vest that costs £200," Hemming says. But they are keen to maintain exclusivity.
"We don't want it to be in every shop, in every town. That's why we've done the deal with Evans Cycles," says Hemming (Sir Chris's bike range is only sold in Evans stores in the UK).

The colour schemes fit with that of the velodrome: red, blue, grey, black and yellow. And the women's line is very similar.
"We didn't want to just shrink it and pink it," Hemming says. "We wanted to create a women's range that suited female needs, so all the products are tested on female models."
For the time being HOY is maintaining its focus in the UK, but Hemming assures me that this is a long term project.
