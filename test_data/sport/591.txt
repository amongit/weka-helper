England v Denmark: how the players rated at Wembley Stadium

Comments
England (4-3-3)
Joe Hart 7/10 Other than one nervous moment when the keeper raced off his line to gather a long ball, Hart looked extremely confident and did well to stop substitute Morten Rasmussen from scoring. There is no doubt he will go to the World Cup as Hodgson's number one. Verdict: On the plane.
Glen Johnson 6 Raided forwards at every opportunity, but left space behind him that Denmark managed to exploit at times. With Kyle Walker injured, Johnson had the chance to stake a claim to be first-choice right back in Brazil but did not quite do enough to be sure of a starting place. Verdict: On the plane.
Gary Cahill 7 Reliable in his own penalty area and dangerous in the opposition six-yard box from set pieces, Cahill will be a vital member of Hodgson's team at the World Cup. Marshalls the defence well and relishes the challenge of big games. Verdict: On the plane.
Chris Smalling 6 Stepped in to deputise for the injured Phil Jagielka. Smalling's versatility gives him a good chance of being part of Hodgson's final 23-man squad, but only injuries or suspensions will see the 24-year-old get much playing time in Brazil. Verdict: In the departure lounge.
Five things we learnt from Wembley win
Sturridge heads anaemic England to victory
England v Denmark: as it happened
Liverpool – your country needs you
Alan Smith: A close call but Shaw wins my vote over Cole
Ashley Cole 7 The Chelsea man was not particularly troubled by the Danish attack and managed to get forwards to support England's attack. Produced a great cross that Sterling should have scored from. Hodgson knows he will be able to depend on Cole if he travels to Brazil as Leighton Baines' deputy. Verdict: In the departure lounge.
Jordan Henderson 5 Part of the five-man Liverpool contingent that started the game. Henderson did not get enough of the ball during the first half and did not drive forwards as he has done at Anfield this season. Verdict: In the departure lounge.
Steven Gerrard 6 The captain anchored England's midfield as he does for Liverpool. Gerrard was prevented a shot on goal by a cynical challenge from Denmark's Casper Sloth. Verdict: On the plane.
Jack Wilshere 6 Looked in real pain when he was caught by Daniel Agger early in the game, but the midfielder managed to carry on after lengthy treatment. Plenty of effort and determination, but could not pick a killer pass Verdict: In the departure lounge.
Raheem Sterling 8 England's brightest player. The winger swapped between both flanks and kept the Denmark defence busy with his pace and trickery. Could have scored from an Ashley Cole pass, but the ball bounced off a defender and on to the post. Verdict: In the departure lounge.
Wayne Rooney 6 Seen as England's answer to Luis Suarez in Hodgson's team based around Liverpool players. Rooney and Sturridge will need to develop the same awareness of each other's games for the Anfield plan to work at international level. Verdict: On the plane.
Daniel Sturridge 8 The in-form striker scored England’s winning goal with a header from substitute Adam Lallana’s cross and tested keeper Kasper Schmeichel on a couple of occasions. Sturridge is pretty much guaranteed a starting spot in Hodgson’s World Cup team. Verdict: On the plane.
Subs
Luke Shaw (on for Cole, 46) 7 Given the full second-half by Hodgson in his left-back shootout with Cole. The teenager can be satisfied with his England debut and has given the manager a real selection headache.
Adam Lallana (on for Wilshere, 58) 7 Offered England more of an attacking threat than Wilshere and provided the cross from which Daniel Sturridge scored.
Danny Welbeck (on for Rooney, 60) 7 Forced Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel into a couple of good saves and looked dangerous.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (on for Henderson, 77) 6 Employed in the centre of midfield as a late replacement for Henderson and tried to push forwards.
Andros Townsend (on for Sterling, 86) 6 The Tottenham winger was not given enough time to impress.
James Milner (on for Sturridge, 87) 6 Sent on by Hodgson to protect a one-goal lead.
