Luton Town taste redemption and join the giant-killing greats with victory over Norwich City

It was 1989 that a non-league club had last toppled a team in the top flight in this competition, with Sutton's defeat of then holders Coventry, and given Luton's recent record of three straight relegations their victory could not have been more ecstatically received.
"It is an incredible achievement by the players," said Luton manager Paul Buckle, after Scott Rendell's 80th-minute strike sealed one of the finest wins in the club's 127-year history.
"It wasn't a fluke, either. It wasn't as if we were hanging on for dear life at any point."
Luton's celebrations extended from Norfolk to the West Indies, where chairman Nick Owen, the former breakfast television presenter, was delivering a motivational speech on a Caribbean cruise.
No one was happier last night than Rendell, the journeyman striker whom Buckle brought on with 15 minutes remaining and who supplied the winner with a fine finish into the top corner.

"It's an unbelievable feeling to come here and turn Norwich over," said the 26-year-old, who did not ignore Luton's miseries since 2006 in falling three divisions from the Championship to the Blue Square Premier, or their 30-point deduction three years ago over irregular payments to agents.
"The fans have been through tough times. But here they were fantastic, they never stopped singing. We were not going to outplay Norwich but we stuck to our gameplan and took our chances."
Fellow forward Jon Shaw was tearful as he drank in the reaction of Luton's 4,000 travelling supporters.
"I had a little wobble as the game finished," he said.
"I started to well up a bit. It is amazing, the type of occasion we will never see again."
