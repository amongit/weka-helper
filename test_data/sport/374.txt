Usain Bolt reviews babies' attempts at his trademark lightning bolt pose

His signature lightning bolt celebration pose was one of the iconic images of the London 2012 Games.
Now Usain Bolt, the six-time Olympic gold medallist widely regarded as the fastest man in the world, has started giving tips on the move - to babies.
The 28-year-old has been swamped with pictures of infants appearing to perfect his trademark stance, one of the most famous in sport.
Fans have been using Twitter to send him images of their children, many of them sleeping, inadvertently pulling the arms-outstretched pose.
And on Monday afternoon, Jamaican sprinter Bolt spent time reviewing the pictures and retweeting them to his more than 3.5million followers.

He also added tongue-in-cheek words of encouragement to his young fans on the social network, describing their efforts as "epic", "sweet", "perfect" and saying one was "a natural".

Bolt even found time to offer a tip to one baby who had not quite mastered the lightning bolt pose.

While Bolt is famous for the move, his fellow Olympian Mo Farah is known for doing the "Mobot".
It came after an appearance on a sports quiz show when host James Corden insisted the runner needed a victory pose - and fellow guest Clare Balding suggested he formed an 'M' shape above his head.
Bolt is the first man to hold both the 100m and 200m world records since fully automatic time measurements were introduced in 1977.
He also helped the Jamaican 4x100m relay team to a world record win with a time of 36.84sec during the London Olympics.
