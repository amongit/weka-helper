England's defeat by Russia at the women's rugby sevens World Series in Atlanta has caused a setback for Great Britain's Olympic hopes.
To automatically qualify for Rio 2016, England - competing on behalf of Great Britain - must finish in the top four but currently lie in sixth place.
Coach Simon Middleton was unhappy with the 24-0 quarter-final loss to Russia.
"We did not front up, giving away possession and penalties early doors and that set the tone," he said.
The England sevens squad are the only women currently being paid by the RFU but, after opening-day wins against Canada, Brazil and China, they went down to Russia.
They then lost 24-12 to Australia in the plate before beating Brazil 31-10 to claim seventh place.
New Zealand beat USA in the final to top the standings after three legs of six in the World Series which moves to Canada next month.
