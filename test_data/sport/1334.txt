Dylan Hartley's England place not in danger, despite discipline problems

Graham Rowntree, the England forwards coach, has said that he would not swap Dylan Hartley for any other hooker in the world.
"No," he said when asked. "Having worked with him and seen how he has developed and grown up and the impact he has on the group - I am a big fan."
Despite Hartley's poor disciplinary record Rowntree insisted that his England place has never been in jeopardy. "Never - it is a good headline, mind," he said, speaking before the player's yellow card on Saturday. "He has got a lot of credit in the bank has Dylan."
Rowntree confirmed that he had spoken to Hartley but no ultimatum had been issued that this is his last chance (he has been banned for a total of 50 weeks in his career, including missing the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia in 2013 and was sent to the sin-bin against South Africa last autumn).
"It has never been mentioned," Rowntree said. "Stuart [Lancaster] will sit down with him, I have spoken to him already. Stuart sits down with all the guys as they come into camp and has one-on-ones with them and we will keep addressing the subject with him and help him through it. He has to deal with other players goading him. We have got to hold his hand and help him through that.

"We sit down with him all the time in camp and say, 'What are you thinking, what is happening in the game?' We are not going to cast him aside. We can't hide away from it - internally we will just help him through it."
Four years ago Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, taunted Hartley before the match in Cardiff, saying: "Dylan Hartley always seems to have a lot to say for himself, but we will see what he's got next week".
But Rowntree stressed that Hartley had responded well. "Gatland called him out before the game and he apologised to him afterwards - I was there when he did," Rowntree said.
"I actually thought he was man of the match in that game the way he dealt with that pressure, the way he got on with his job - it was a good victory for us that night [England won 26-19]."
Rowntree had particular praise for Hartley's leadership and set-piece work. "There has been a lot said about Dylan but what you can't hide away from when you have worked with him is what he brings to the group in terms of leadership. You could see it at the weekend in the Ospreys game - his small talk and the way he is bringing guys in, talking to the guys around him and helping the guys around him.
"His set piece is immaculate. In the autumn series our line-out was 94 per cent - the highest it has been - and a lot of that is down to Dylan's throwing."
England face Wales in Cardiff on Feb 6, and Rowntree insisted that that his team had learnt the lessons of their 30-3 defeat there two years ago. "It was an incredible learning experience. There was an incredible atmosphere, like I have never experienced before - and I have been down there a few times. That night took it to a new level, particularly when they turned the lights off and had the fireworks.
"We didn't see that coming â€” we didn't go down there with any arrogance but we learned a lot from it. The team has got lot of experience since then."
