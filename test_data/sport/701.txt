Giedo van der Garde concedes he will never drive in Formula One again after Sauber debacle

Giedo van der Garde, who has reached a multimillion-pound settlement with Sauber, has conceded he will never drive in Formula One again after nearly bringing the team to its knees and tarnishing the sport’s opening weekend in Australia.
The Dutchman and the beleaguered team agreed a deal after an explosive legal battle in Melbourne, one which earned him compassion from other drivers but attracted antipathy from the sport’s authorities.
Van der Garde, who had been dropped by Sauber after signing a contract last year, made a plea for the rights of would-be Formula One drivers after years of “pay” drivers dominating the sport.
It is thought the 29-year-old paid as much as £6 million for his seat, and is expected to have received a similar amount in compensation. In a move which attracted scorn in the paddock, Sauber signed Felipe Nasr and Marcuss Ericsson because they brought in a combined £20 million; vital to their survival.
There had been fears that any settlement would cripple Sauber, but for now they appear to be clinging on. They even announced a modest sponsorship deal with Singapore Airlines on Wednesday.
But their reputation has been dragged through the mud by the allegations made by Van der Garde.

In a lengthy statement, he said: “As a passionate race driver, I feel sad and am very disappointed. I have worked very hard my entire career, ever since starting with go-karts at the age of eight, to live my dream and become a successful Formula 1 driver.

"I had hoped at last to be able to show what I am capable of, driving a car for a respected midfield team in the 2015 season. This dream has been taken away from me and I know that my future in Formula 1 is probably over.
"There has been a lot of speculation in the media over the past week, so I want to set out clearly that my sponsors paid the sponsorship fee related to the 2015 season in its entirety to Sauber in the first half of 2014.
"This was simply in good faith and to help the team deal with its cash problems at the time. Effectively, it was my sponsor's advanced payments that helped the team survive in 2014.
"Sauber's financial decision-making in this case is bizarre and makes no sense to me. I am not at liberty to discuss details, but Sauber paid significant compensation to avoid honouring the contract they had with me.
"Only in that respect can I be satisfied that my rights have finally been recognised and that at least some justice has been done."
There was a serious possibility that Sauber’s cars could have been seized by bailiffs in Melbourne, and that their team principal, Monisha Kaltenborn, would be arrested. With finances tighter than ever, Van der Garde’s plea for more rights to protect young drivers will likely fall on deaf appears.
