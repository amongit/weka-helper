Liverpool vs Manchester United: The time is right for Steven Gerrard to say goodbye

This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season against their biggest rivals and their celebrated captain, icon and heartbeat could only make the bench. He is fit and available, but surplus to Brendan Rodgers’ requirements. The frustration felt might help explain why he stamped on Ander Herrera just 30 seconds after coming on at the start of the second half.
• Gerrard sent off for stamp just 25 seconds after coming off the bench
There is a good reason Liverpool delayed offering him a new contract and it is why Gerrard will leave for a new adventure with LA Galaxy at the end of the season. Gerrard is a true Liverpool great, a legend even if he returns to manage the club and makes a mess out of it one day, but he is not the player he was and he knows it. It’s the right time for Gerrard to say goodbye because, as a business, Liverpool simply could not justify satisfying the high wage demands of a squad player, no matter how important he has been

Manchester United are better than Liverpool
The visitors have improved markedly since Louis van Gaal took over
They may be competing for the consolation prize of a place in the Champions League rather than the title, but this surely settles one of this season’s enduring arguments. Manchester United are better than Liverpool. The league table does not lie and neither do results. Both clubs spent heavily last summer, both teams were rebuilt, but it is Manchester United who have emerged as the stronger of the two. Not only has Louis van Gaal won his first two games against Liverpool as United manager, the Red Devils are now five points clear of their bitter rivals in the table. Brendan Rodgers’ side are not as good as they were with Luis Suarez in the team, United have got better since van Gaal replaced David Moyes. It feels like the end of the argument for this season at least.

Raheem Sterling needs to get his head right
Raheem Sterling's form has tailed off as his contract negotiations have dragged on
Sterling did not start the season well when the friction caused by his protracted contract negotiations first began to emerge and he was out of sorts again here just days after Liverpool confirmed his representatives have told them he will not sign a new deal. Talks have been put on hold until the summer, which looks like a delaying tactic designed to attract transfer bids in order to put pressure on Liverpool’s board. In the meantime Sterling’s head has been either turned or battered. He disappeared in this game and it is a reminder footballers are human beings, not cash cows.

Manchester United are a better team when Juan Mata plays
Juan Mata had one of his best games in a United shirt
Mata is precisely the sort of player England manager Roy Hodgson needs, although that could be said about so many Spanish players. More importantly, he is exactly the sort of player Manchester United need. It is not a coincidence that two of their best performances of the season – here and against Tottenham Hostpur last weekend came with Mata on the right wing. It’s the way he spreads doubt in the minds of opposition defenders that gives United an extra dimension. He can go in behind, as he did for his goal, beat players from a standing start or simply cut through them with a first time pass. A wonderful footballer.

Pele has bills to pay
Brazil legend Pele was watching from the stands at Anfield
The sight of one of the world’s best players at Anfield working as a brand ambassador for a sandwich making franchise – who also happen to be an official partner of Liverpool Football Club - is yet another sign football has sold its soul, but who can blame Pele for making some easy money? The Brazilian may have been the best player of his generation, but he did not earn in his career what most top modern players will earn in a couple of years. He has bills to pay. Given the 74-year-old previously been the face of a company pledging to tackle the problem of erectile dysfunction, his association with Subway must have been easy to swallow.
