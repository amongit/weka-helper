CSC shores up hybrid cloud, migration capabilities
Global integrator CSC, based in Falls Church, Va., solidified several alliances during the first quarter designed to support the increasing number of client projects spread over on-premises infrastructure as well as public and private cloud services. Here are three of the most notable partnerships that were announced publicly:
Integration plans with Microsoft - Under a deal announced in late March, CSC intends to connect its ServiceMesh Agility Platform with the Microsoft System Center data center management platform. The intention is to help enterprises build, catalog, deploy and manage applications on multiple cloud services including CSC BizCloud and Microsoft Azure. The development builds on a long-standing relationship that has spanned the last two decades.
CSC bought the ServiceMesh technology late last year as part of its aggressive push into cloud services and solutions, particularly those that help broker and orchestrate hybrid infrastructure.
Cloud brokering solution for vCloud - Also in March, CSC revealed that it is adding a hybrid cloud brokering solution within ServiceMesh that will enable its customers to develop and move workloads across combinations of VMware vCloud Hybrid Service, BizCloud, CSC CloudCompute and other commercially available cloud offerings. The relationship will make it simpler to migrate workloads between CSC and VMware cloud offerings. Explains Eric Pulier, vice president and general manager, Cloud, for CSC: "VMware vCloud Hybrid Service is ideal for VMware customers moving workloads from traditional data centers to the cloud. ServiceMesh enables these same customers to eliminate application change requirements when targeting other non-VMware-based workloads and applications for the cloud."
Application modernization support - As of January 2014, CSC is teaming with HCL Technologies to help enterprises prepare legacy software and applications for deployment and management in the cloud. There is a vertical bent to the relationship, at least initially, with the two integrators focusing on banking and financial services through a center of excellence. The delivery centers are being launched first in Bangalore and Chennai in India. The two companies will share revenue and costs associated with projects. In addition HCL will white-label CSC's BizCloud private cloud offering.
