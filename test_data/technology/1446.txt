In addition, Google has planned further delights that will give customers the chance to play with Google's software tools and apps, the company said. The installations will include an immersive surround screen installation (seen above) called Portal, where users can "fly" through "any part of the planet with Google Earth", the company said.This is the Doodle Wall where "budding graffiti artists" can use digital spray cans to paint their own take on Google's logo, which they can then share on social media.The company said that with The Google shop it hopes to host regular classes and events for the public. Classes will range from "how to keep secure online" to learning how devices work.It will also feature a Chromecast Pod where customers can use Google Play Movies, YouTube, and other software, "all cast through a Chromecast dongle that converts any TV into a smart TV".Another idea is 'Virtual Space Camp' which will be offered to teach children the basics of coding and teachers will be invited to 'open house' events, to keep up to speed on the free educational tools on offer from Google, the company said.Further reading:Google to acquire mobile advertising firm InMobi: reportGoogle CFO Patrick Pichette retiring; will stay on through transitionDixons closes to make way for PC World and CurrysSearch-to-smartphones-and-tablets giant Google has chosen London to try out its first physical retail presence.The 'shop' on London's Tottenham Court Road - a street best known for its electronics retailers - is located within a store belonging to UK home electronics chain Currys PC World.Images: Google
