Microsoft brings Office Lens scanning app to iOS, Android
Office Lens, a scanning app that's been a hit on Windows Phone, is coming to iOS and Android.
On April 2, Microsoft made available a preview of the Android version of Office Lens in the Google Play Store. It also released to general availability Office Lens for iOS in the Apple App Store.
Both the iOS and Android versions of Office Lens, like the Windows Phone version, are free.
Office Lens allows users to take pictures of receipts, business cards, whiteboards, sticky notes -- and, in my case, beer menus -- and save them to OneNote, Microsoft's note-taking app. OneNote also is free and available for Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, Android and on the Web.
(Microsoft also enables users to convert saved Office Lens images to Word and PowerPoint documents, too.)
Office Lens automatically crops, enhances and cleans up images. It also enables users to search for key words in the images via optical character recognition.

Microsoft does plan to make additional features available across all the Office Lens version in the future, however, a spokesperson confirmed.
