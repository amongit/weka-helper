HP 'leapfrogs' EMC to take deduplication record
HP has "leapfrogged" rival EMC to claim the greatest deduplication rate in the industry.
MB262003375 The update to HP's StoreOnce software technology, named Catalyst, was announced at HP Discover in Las Vegas on Monday. The technology is capable of ingesting up to 100TB of data per hour when paired with HP's B6200 backup array, David Scott, general manager for HP Storage, said on Monday.
"Today represents the essential completion of our vision of federated deduplication," he said. "[It's] three times faster than EMC DataDomain's highest performing platform."
Scott said HP had "leapfrogged" EMC, which had briefly taken the lead with the announcement of its Datadomain DD990 gear at EMC World just two weeks ago. The DD990 can ingest and dedupe data at a rate of up to 31TB per hour.
The ingest rate of HP's new StoreOnce technology would let you deduplicate the Library of Congress three times over the course of a night, he said. HP launched StoreOnce two years ago at HP Discover as part of its push into high-end storage â€” a move later followed by its acquisition of tiering-specialist 3Par.
