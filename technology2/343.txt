Hootsuite starts LatAm expansion from Brazil
Social media management firm Hootsuite has launched an office in São Paulo to run its business in Latin America - a market where it intends to double its user base in the next three years.
The company's president for Latin America Celso Ferraz joined the company from analytics software firm Splunk, where he also headed operations for the region.
Ferraz told newspaper Valor Econômico that the plan is to have a team of 25 people solely dedicated to the region and offer more localized content.
Hootsuite has 11 million users worldwide, with 1,4 million free users in Latin America. Other important markets in the region are Mexico - where the Canadian company is also looking to open an office - as well as Colombia and Argentina.
According to the company, there are 100 enterprise Hootsuite users in Latin America.
One of Canada's most successful tech startups with a valuation said to be above $1bn, Hootsuite's product is a "social media dashboard" for management of multiple social media channels.
The company's tool allows tracking of mentions and traffic, as well as post scheduling across networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+. In the corporate space, it allows teams to collaboratively execute campaigns across social networks.
