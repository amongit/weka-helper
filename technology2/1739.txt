Intel eyes data centers with server chip portfolio refresh
Intel is trotting out a new processor family as it hones in on the data center market.

Introduced as the processor giant's first Xeon-branded system-on-a-chip (SoC), the new Xeon processor D product family was designed especially with cloud service providers in mind.
Some of the suggested workload use cases include dedicated web hosting, memory caching and dynamic web serving.
The new addition also means big things for Intel's Internet of Things strategy being this is the Intel's third generation of the hardware company's 64-bit SoC for microserver, storage and networking.
The chipset runs on 14-nanometer process technology, promising up to 3.4 times faster performance per node and up to 1.7 times better performance per watt when compared to the preceding second generation 64-bit SoC product family.
Intel touted there are already more than 50 systems in the design pipeline in partnership with the likes of Hewlett-Packard, Cisco and NEC, among others. Approximately 75 percent of this initial pool are said to specifically concern network, storage and Internet of Things.
The Intel Xeon processor D product family is launching 4- and 8-core microserver optimized SoCs immediately with prices starting at $199.00 and $581.00, respectively.
Additional options optimized for network, storage and Internet of Things SoCs are promised to follow during the second half of the year.
Some of the products on the way will center around embedded devices as well as mid-range routers and wireless base stations.
