Cloud Sherpas, Silverline earn industry-specific Salesforce certification
Back in February, Salesforce.com introduced a new facet to its partner and alliance programs called Fullforce, which enables cloud integrators to deliver specialized solutions for specific industries -- initially in communications and media, financial services, health care, and retail and consumer packaged goods.
Now, Cloud Sherpas and Silverline have earned some of the first certifications under that program focused on financial services processes.
CloudSherpas was certified for a framework that it developed specifically for investment management organizations. The Cloud Sherpas Investment Management Playbook is basically a recipe of processes that the company uses to help financial services firms leverage the Salesforce platform to manage relationships.
For example, Cloud Sherpas created a proprietary application called the External Wholesale app, which creates triggers related to important transactions and that can be used to research information about specific producers or branches before a visit.
The playbook -- mainly meant as an accelerator for deployments -- also includes methodologies for developing mobile solutions for financial services sales teams, for creating an information hob, and for integrating digital and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.
Silverline's Fullforce certification is focused on the area of wealth management. The Salesforce Gold Cloud Alliance Partner has more than 700 customers, mainly in the financial services and health care industries, and Force.com solutions.
