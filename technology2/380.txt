Microsoft moves to phase two of Skype Translator preview; adds new features
Microsoft has launched the second phase of its Skype Translator preview program, adding new features, updats and two new spoken languages to its test bed.
Skype Translator is Microsoft's real-time language-translation service. Microsoft opened phase one of its Skype Translator preview to select testers in December 2014.
Microsoft officials call Skype Translator "a brand new feature from Skype." The new service translates conversations both ways in near real-time. The service will display an on-screen transcript of the call, and also ultimately will translate instant-message chats in more than 45 languages.

According to a blog post announcing the second test phase of Skype Translator, Microsoft also is adding new features to the preview, including:
The Skype Translator preview is currently available only on devices running Windows 8.1 or the Windows 10 Technical Preview, though Microsoft is expected to make it ultimately available across a wide variety of devices and operating systems at some point.
