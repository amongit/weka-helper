OnePlus releases OxygenOS based on Android Lollipop
OnePlus launched the OnePlus One last year, a high end smartphone that offered an excellent value to the consumer. A couple of days ago OnePlus announced OxygenOS, an operating system based on Android Lollipop 5.0.2, available for OnePlus One owners.
When the OnePlus One launched, the default operating system was based on CyanogenMod with the ability for tinkerers to install other variations as they saw fit. The new OxygenOS comes directly from the OnePlus folks and as I understand it is very close to a pure Google experience.
OnePlus designed OxygenOS to focus on performance and battery life while keeping the OS light. There is not yet an over-the-air installation method, but you can visit the oneplus.net/oxygenos site for all the details on how to get it installed on your One.
I never purchased a OnePlus One, but will continue to keep an eye on the company and may pick one up in the future.
