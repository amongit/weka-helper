Five reasons to choose the HTC One M9 instead of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge
Yesterday I wrote five reasons to choose the Galaxy S6 Edge over the HTC One M9 and I thought it would be fair to post the other side of the story. Like the One M9, I initiated a return of the S6 Edge because the constant hunt for a charger and glare on both sides is driving me mad. I'm not yet sure if either of these new flagships will remain past the return period.
I posted my HTC One M9 review a few weeks ago and awarded it a rather high rating. There are many more pros than cons and if you use your camera primarily for online sharing then the M9 may be the perfect device for you.
Both the HTC One M9 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge are excellent choices and the one we purchase is a personal decision. The Galaxy S6 Edge may be the one for you, but these are a few of the reasons I am considering the M9 over the S6 Edge:
I should add a sixth reason and that would be software updates. HTC has a proven track record of providing Android updates on a timely basis while companies like Sony and Samsung often lag behind so that buying a new device is the fastest way to get upgraded to the next version of Android.
HTC released my favorite smartphone ever, the HTC One M7, a couple of years ago and the M9 honestly improves upon that phone in many ways. I have just a couple of more days to make a decision on the M9 and S6 Edge and look forward to reaching that decision deadline.
