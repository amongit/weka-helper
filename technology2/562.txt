Sony set to bring Google TV to UK 'next month'
Google TV is finally coming to the UK, with people being able to pre-order the Android-based set-top boxes now.

Google and Sony intend to launch the device this year in the US, the UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands. According to reports, the device will cost between £200-£300 and will go on sale on 16 July — at the time of writing, Google's press office was unable to confirm either of these assertions.
Apple TV, the most notable rival to the Internet Player with Google TV, costs £99.
"In the UK you'll be able to pop live TV into the background while you read up on the Guardian's website with Chrome, catch up on the latest episode of EastEnders on the BBC iPlayer, view Lauren Luke's latest make-up tips on YouTube, and choose from the hundreds of apps optimized for TV in Google Play," Kothari wrote.
Google TV has been available for the last two years in the US. There were reports in August last year that it would come out in the UK within the subsequent six months, but that did not come to pass.
While early Google TV devices were based on Intel's Atom processors, Google made the switch to ARM-based Marvell chips this year.
