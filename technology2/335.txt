​Android Auto to arrive in Brazil in 2015
Google's in-car system Android Auto should be available to Brazilian consumers in the second half of 2015.
Android Auto product manager Daniel Holle told Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that the launch is planned for later in the year, however a specific date is yet to be defined as car manufacturers still need time to integrate the software to their vehicles.
Android Auto is a system that works with an Android 5.0+ device and a car's head unit or infotainment platform. It allows users to call, get directions, listen to music and a range of other functions while driving.
The platform is intended to minimize the risk of accidents by drastically reduce the amount of glances and button presses by drivers. Google's Holle added that new upcoming resources will allow vehicles to effectively become a connected Android device.

Google hopes that the heated mobile phone segment in Brazil - the sixth largest mobile phone market in the world according to recent eMarketer research - should also help grow the popularity of its platform for cars.
"The competition in the mobile phone market brought many benefits to users. We are excited to see how that can continue in the connected cars market," the Google executive told Folha.
Car makers such as Audi, Bentley, Jeep and Volvo have already announced their plans to offer the Android Auto feature in their products. Other manufacturers that are more popular in Brazil, such as Chevrolet, Ford, Kia and Nissan also plan to integrate Google's in-car system to their vehicles.
