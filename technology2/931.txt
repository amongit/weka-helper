Intel names Centerton successor: Avoton
The successor to Intel's low-power Atom-based Centerton processor will be named Avoton.
The codename will be revealed publicly on Wednesday, said Jason Waxman, head of cloud infrastructure for Intel. The chip will go into production at some point next year and will be made to Intel's tri-gate 22nm process, rather than the 32nm of its Centerton predecessor.
"With the future process advancements we'll be able to hit different [power] points," Waxman told ZDNet UK.
Centerton was announced in April and is Intel's key chip to take on ARM in the low-power server space. On Tuesday HP said it will launch its Gemini server platform with Centerton chips, rather than the Calxeda-designed ARM-based processors it had used on its experimental Redstone server.
