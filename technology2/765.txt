How durable is Samsung's new Galaxy S6?
One of the biggest concerns that consumers have about gadgets relates to robustness. No one wants to spend a few hundred dollars on a new smartphone only to have the screen shatter the first time it hits the floor, or for it to die prematurely if it gets some water on it.
With Samsung getting ready to release its new flagship handsets - the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge - into an eagerly awaiting market, some are rightly anxious about the handset's durability.
Well, fear not! Plenty of people who have managed to get a hold of review devices have been more than happy to put the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge through their paces by dropping them onto sidewalks, putting them into fish tanks, and even cracking walnuts open with a pair of them.
The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge seem pretty durable, being able to survive crashes, bashes, and the occasional dunk. But push things too hard and like most things, it'll break. As always, remember that your experiences may vary, and if you happen to break your S6 while cracking open some nuts, well, you own both parts.
