| Image 1 of 9

"Carrizo" will be an x86 APU built using 28-nanometer architecture and will, according to AMD, be optimized for both power and area efficiency. It is expected to make an appearance inside notebooks and all-in-one PCs towards mid-year, but AMD has unveiled some details about the new chip at International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC).
