Kickstarter campaign will let you grab Jide Ultra Remix Android tablet for $39

A couple of months ago at CES, a group of ex-Google engineers made a splash by announcing their Jide Ultra Remix tablet, an Android slate that focuses on productivity by including a detachable keyboard cover and running their Remix OS, which adds some Windows-like features to Android 4.4 KitKat. Now the company is following that up with a potentially audacious crowd-funding campaign that could snag you the tablet for a dirt-cheap price.
Starting next week on Kickstarter, Jide will offer a tablet to any person who contributes to its campaign at any of its funding levels. Since the minimum level will be set at $39, you will be able to obtain the device for under $50.
If that sounds too good to be true, it is -- a bit. In exchange for obtaining the Ultra Remix via the campaign, you have to agree to be a tester for Jide, which is obviously placing a new OS out in the wild and preparing to upgrade it to work with Android 5.0 Lollipop.
That could be a minimal sacrifice for saving more than 90 percent off the planned $399 price for the tablet when it starts shipping later this year. You'll get a device with an 11.6-inch 1,920x1,080 display, 2GB of RAM, 64GB of built-in storage, an Nvidia Tegra 4 processor, and a large 8,100 mAh battery.
It's unclear how many Ultra Remix tablets will be available through the Kickstarter campaign, which seems designed to build buzz rather than fund production, as Android's answer to the Microsoft Surface is already for sale in China. We'll update this post if we find out additional details on the campaign.
Does Jide's potential deal sound good to you? Are you going to try to fund the campaign and become a tester in order to get your hands on the Ultra Remix tablet? Let us know in the Talkback section below.
