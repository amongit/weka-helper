TCS expands Singapore center to support global banks
Tata Consultancy Services has expanded its operations in Singapore with a new center to service global banks operating in the Asia-Pacific region.
The 1,000-seat facility replaces a previous 500-seat center, which was launched in 2011, and will offer a range of services including application development and IT services. The new site is part of the banking and financial services business that accounts for more than 40 percent of TCS' overall revenue, said the Indian IT services provider in a statement Wednesday.
Noting that the company has been operating in Singapore for nearly 30 years, Girish Ramachandran, Asia-Pacific president of TCS, said: "We have seen a growing shift of our global banking and financial services clients moving core elements of their operations to Singapore in order to be closer to the fast emerging Asia region, and to leverage talent and government incentives that give them an global competitive edge.
"Singapore is our regional headquarters for APAC operations, and we are committed to expand our presence in this market and to assist our global clients," he said.
