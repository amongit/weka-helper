iOS tool lets iPhone users take their content to Android for free
Samsung has pushed to poach iPhone users in the UK by offering them a free iOS-to-Android content-transfer tool.
The Korean manufacturer said on Friday that it would be offering anyone buying a Galaxy device in the country a copy of Easy Phone Sync, through an exclusive licensing deal with developer Media Mushroom. The tool lets users transfer iPhone and iTunes contacts, text messages, audio and video to devices such as the Galaxy S III.
MB263157817 "We know that traditionally iPhone users have been reluctant to switch to an Android device because they couldn't use iTunes to manage their content," Samsung UK and Ireland vice president Simon Stanford said in a statement. "Easy Phone Sync means people can now enjoy their iTunes content on a Samsung Galaxy phone. What's more is that it’s really easy for them to do, and literally takes five minutes to set up."
The Easy Phone Sync tool comes in two parts: one for the PC or Mac and the other for the Galaxy device.
In recent months, Samsung — already the most successful Android device-maker by far — overtook Nokia to become the world's top mobile phone manufacturer, selling more than twice as many smartphones as Apple.
The Galaxy S III, Samsung's new flagship phone, has won many plaudits, although the manufacturer is currently looking into reports of one of the devices spontaneously bursting into flame.
