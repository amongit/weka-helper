ARM looks to benchmarking to improve performance

British semiconductor and software design company ARM is turning to benchmarking to make its chips faster and more efficient.
ARM, which is a big hitter with smartphone makers, has purchased an enterprise license from British startup GameBench to enable it to carry out real-world performance and usability testing on its chips. The license also allows "a number of ARM's biggest partners" to also use GameBench's benchmarking tools.
"Our silicon partners want to understand how real-world workloads will run on mobile devices," said James Bruce, director, mobile solutions, ARM. "We are assessing the potential of using GameBench to help partners tune the efficiency and performance of our ARM Cortex CPUs and ARM Mali GPUs."
"We're pleased that ARM, a pioneer of the mobile industry, sees the merit of what we're trying to do," said GameBench's CEO, Sri Kannan Iyer. "Our goal is to develop a reliable, objective framework by which app developers, hardware makers and end users can judge the performance of any app or device. ARM's support is key to this mission."
If you're not ARM or one of its partners, fear not. Developers, product reviewers and enthusiasts can also benefit from a free version of the GameBench app for the Android platform, which according to the company has so far been used to test 1,600 different apps running on nearly 700 unique Android device models.
