Dell leans on own MDM software with new Venue 10 7000 tablet

Getting a tablet to stick out in this burgeoning connected world is no easy feat, and it's increasingly difficult in the slightly narrowed Android ecosystem.

Using the angle of an enterprise-friendly device as the sole selling point is also becoming harder by the day, so it takes some extra handiwork inside and out to stand out from the pack.
Dell is aiming to do just that with its newly unveiled Venue 10 7000, an Android 5.0-based tablet sporting nearly every spec (and hyperbole) expected of a business-minded mobile device these days.
That includes an Intel Atom Z3580 quad-core processor, a 10.5-inch OLED 2560x1600 display, and an Intel RealSense snapshot depth camera, touted to shoot "a depth map for every picture captured."
All of that is encapsulated in a form factor that can be reconfigured in five different positions from tablet to tent to clamshell depending when the user wants to be productive or simply watch a movie while seated in business class.
But what really might stand out -- at least concerning IT decision-makers -- is the tailored security measures and software coming from the hardware designer itself.
Dell highlighted the implementation of its own Mobile Management and Mobile Workspace layers for managing app access and policy enforcement while also giving the end user some wiggle room through a separate digital environment on the same device.
MDM isn't anything new at this point, but when it's handed down by the same technology provider tied up in one nice package, it can become a more attractive offering for IT managers at companies ranging from the enterprise to SMBs with little time or resources to shop around.
Schedule to ship in May, the Venue 10 7000 starts at $499 for a standalone model that does not include the backlit keyboard making all of those different poses possible. For users that do want the keyboard, the price is $629.
