Talks of Intel buying Altera send stocks soaring
There have been a bevy of mergers and acquisitions this week in the tech market, but none would come close to what Intel has planned if latest reports are accurate.
Five big questions for Intel
The processor maker is in talks to acquire Altera Corp., according to The Wall Street Journal on Friday.
The San Jose, Calif.-based company produces CMOS-based programmable logic devices and related development software.
With the news breaking just around the closing bell on Friday afternoon, stocks for both companies both went into a tizzy.
Intel stocks jumped by just over six percent in response to the WSJ story, while Altera skyrocketed by more than 21 percent -- the highest level Altera shares have seen since July 2011, according to MarketWatch.
Compare that to a pithy drop of 2.91 percent a few days ago, and it would appear shareholders are very keen on a merger with Intel.
Intel and Altera already have a history, becoming more amicable in 2013 when Intel's manufacturing processors became the foundation for Altera's then-latest 64-bit ARM chip.
It remains to be seen how Intel would make use of Altera's portfolio and technology, although Internet-of-Things is often top of mind for the tech giant these days.
Some of Intel's most recent purchases include Axxia's network chip business for $650 million in August 2014 and broadband and networking gear maker Lantiq this past February. Terms of the latter deal were not disclosed.
