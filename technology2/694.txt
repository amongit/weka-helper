Forrester's top emerging technologies to watch, now through 2020
The Future of IT: A Strategic Guide
ZDNet and TechRepublic draw on their community of C-level executives and business thinkers to prognosticate where business technology is headed.
Technology has given your customers choices and digital predators the edge. Ask marketing: They will tell you about the decreasing effectiveness of traditional campaigns. Look at your business strategy and find plans to address new digital competitors that have become serious threats overnight.
Across the board, Forrester finds high expectations that emerging technology will help firms stay competitive amidst these changes. But which ones should you pay attention to? Cloud, mobile, social, big data? Are these even the right things to be looking at in 2015?
Unfortunately, our survey data says that enterprise architects’ ability to anticipate business needs for emerging technology is trending in the wrong direction. Between 2012 and 2013, the number of businesses that were unhappy with their firm’s ability to introduce emerging technologies almost doubled. Now, in 2014-2015, we expect it to be even worse.
To help our clients, we radically rethought this year’s edition of our top emerging technologies to address these age-of-the-customer realities. My colleague Frank Gillett and I grouped our list into business solutions and three platform innovation groups that most strongly support customers’ engagement across their life cycle:
Four innovation groups organize our Top 15 emerging technologies this year:

Here is a summary of each group from our report, The Top Emerging Technologies To Watch: Now Through 2020.
Closely watch these technologies as part of your business technology agenda, which my colleague Kyle McNabb discussed in his August 13 blog post titled Top Technologies For Your BT Agenda.
