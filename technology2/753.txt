It's taken months, but iOS 8.3 finally addresses Wi-Fi problems
It's taken Apple eight iOS 8 releases and almost seven months of stonewalling users, but a fix for the Wi-Fi issues that have been plaguing users since iOS 8 landed has finally made it into iOS 8.3.
The issues -- which include dropped Wi-Fi, intermittent AirPlay issues, and rejected passwords -- have been documented on a huge thread over on Apple's support forum.
The iOS 8.3 release notes mention several Wi-Fi and Bluetooth -- which could also be patchy at times -- related issues that have been patched:
A quick look at the forum suggests that this update does address the issues, with several of the members previously suffering from problems hailing it a success.
If you're running iOS 8, then I suggest installing the 8.3 update, not only because it fixes a whole lot of bugs, but because it also brings a number of new features to the iPhone and iPad.
