Salesforce continues to drive wearable innovations
Today Salesforce.com offered a formal update on its Salesforce Wear offering (which I wrote about at its release here). Salesforce Wear is a set of developer tools and reference applications that allows enterprises to create applications for an array of wearable devices and link them to Salesforce1, a cloud based platform that connects customers with apps and devices.
Salesforce’s entry into the wearables space has been both bold and well-timed. Salesforce Wear constitutes a first mover in the wearables platform space; while Android Wear offers a platform, it only reaches Android Wear based devices – unlike Salesforce Wear, which operates across a wide array of wearable devices. While it’s early to market, it’s not too early: Enterprises in a wide array of verticals are leveraging wearables worn by employees or by customers to redesign their processes and customer experiences, as I have written.
Salesforce.com adds Jawbone, Oculus Rift, smart devices to wearables platform
With today’s announcement, Salesforce:
Salesforce Wear is living up to my early assessment that it would be an engine of innovation for the wearables market. It’s helping companies innovate in workforce enablement and in crafting new wearable-powered customer experiences, whether the devices are worn by employees or by customers. It’s worth checking out if you are currently devising wearables strategies of your own.
