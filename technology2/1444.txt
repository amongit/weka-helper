Google slashes price of Project Tango Tablet Developers kit in half

Google launched the Project Tango Tablet Developers kit last June as a way to spur application development for 3D mobile sensing experiences. Developers whose applications were accepted received a tablet with solid specs, but paid a hefty price for it: $1,024, to be exact.
Now the company is looking to lure additional developers to request a kit by making the price a lot more affordable. According to Android Police, Google has informed some applicants via email that they can purchase a Project Tango kit that is half the original price. Google also cryptically mentioned that it would be "opening up sales more broadly" in the near future.
For $512, the tablet now looks like a much better deal for applicants, featuring an Nvidia Tegra K1 processor, 1,920x1,200 7-inch display, 128GB of built-in storage, and a 170-degree motion tracking camera, among other features. Google also provides developer resources to let owners get the most out of the on-board motion-tracking and depth-perception sensors.
It's unclear just how "broadly" Google would open up sales, though this wouldn't have the more widespread appeal of Google Glass, which had the plug pulled on it a few months ago. Then again, Google Glass hasn't been viewed as a runaway success, so the company may be a little more judicious in opening things up with Project Tango.
For the moment, the process to obtain the tablet development kit remains the same: Head to the Project Tango website, and fill out a short form to apply. Developers, will the price cut make you more likely to apply now? Let us know in the Talkback section below.
