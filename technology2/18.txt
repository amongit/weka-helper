A small robot which filmed the first images inside the reactor of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant, stopped working just three hours into its mission.
The six-reactor nuclear plant was badly damaged after the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems to reactors, leading to meltdowns and the release of radioactivity.
Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports from Tokyo.
