Apple announces WWDC 2015 event on June 8. New Apple TV inbound?
For the 26th consecutive year, Apple will hold its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in 2015, with this year's event kicking off on June 8. The conference will take place in San Francisco's Moscone West through June 12.
Apple CEO Tim Cook's media tour: 5 takeaways
Apple under Tim Cook is more approachable, transparent and potentially collaborative. Will that be enough without a new product category?
Due to the large demand for tickets and limited space, Apple is asking developers to apply for tickets starting today. Applications are accepted through Friday, April 17 at 10am PT and developers will know by the following Monday afternoon if they will be getting tickets. Those that can't make it can watch a select number of the more than 100 technical sessions through a live stream provided by Apple.
Although WWDC is aimed at developers who create apps for Apple's iOS and OS X software platforms, it's not unheard of for Apple to introduce new or updated hardware products. In 2012, the MacBook Pro with Retina Display took center stage at WWDC, for example, and the Mac Pro was introduced at the following year's conference.
Unless Apple has another press event scheduled between now and June -- which I doubt at this point in time -- there's a good chance the rumored next-generation Apple TV and apps make an appearance.
Apple has started to create key partnerships for its set-top box to carry what was previously cable- or satellite-only programming; HBO Now is available for $14.99 a month on Apple TV. The Apple TV itself also received a price cut from $99 to $69 month last month, signaling a potentially new model.
Even so, this is a developer event. It's a safe bet that Apple unveils details of iOS 9 for its iPhone and iPad products this coming June.
