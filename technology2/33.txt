Apple survey: Love it or hate it?
Apple has quietly changed from being shunned in the enterprise to become one of the most popular vendors for end-user hardware within organizations. The ease of use of products such as the iPhone and the iPad have played a major role in this transition.
Take Tech Pro Research's Apple survey.
Tech Pro Research is conducting a survey to find out how Apple is used within the enterprise. Take the survey and share how Apple is impacting your organization. What are the positive outcomes? What are the negative outcomes? What other vendors are you using for your hardware needs?
Take our newest survey and tell us how the influx of Apple devices have changed the tech landscape within your organization.
If you'd like a free copy of the research report, normally available only to Tech Pro Research subscribers, you'll have the option of entering your email address at the end of the survey.
