AWS lands more enterprise software vendors building on its cloud
Amazon Web Services said that it has landed more enterprise software vendors going all-in and using its cloud platform to power their services.
The Industry Cloud: Why It's Next
Coud computing has engulfed lots of IT, but one of the untapped regions of the tech and business world is the industry cloud, focusing on vertical industries and more specialized applications.
The company said Thursday that MicroStrategy, Software AG, Tibco and Onshape will deliver their software-as-a-service offerings on the AWS platform. Vendors including Infor, Informatica and Splunk are some of the other software vendors using AWS.
AWS' real end game is to land more enterprise customers even indirectly. If enough software providers build on AWS infrastructure you could be a customer and not even know it.
Meanwhile, the deals with independent software providers highlight how Amazon is building out its ecosystem. In recent years, AWS has been pushing its breadth of partners as a differentiator in the public cloud game.
Of the providers announced Thursday, most of them have an analytics, data integration and big data spin to them. AWS benefits as these software providers gradually move their offerings to its cloud.
