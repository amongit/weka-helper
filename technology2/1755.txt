Galaxy device owners won't be happy to hear that Samsung is not yet working on Android 5.1 updates for any of them. This reportedly comes directly from Samsung, so any rumors claiming otherwise are baseless.
Samsung is still rolling out Lollipop to its existing product line so this is in line with the company's track record.

Asus has raised its sales expectations for smartphones to 30 million for this year. The company is on the rise in this category, given it only shipped 10,000 units in early 2014.
CEO Jonney Shih stated that a third of that comes from China which indicates a healthy number will be sold elsewhere. The company's ZenFone 2 has been well received by the market and no doubt plays a significant role in the turnaround.
