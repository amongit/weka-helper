eBay bulks up leadership team ahead of PayPal split
eBay is bulking up its executive team ahead of the planned split with PayPal later this year.
Joining eBay are former Home Depot executive Harry Lawton, who will head eBay North America; former Agilent Technologies executive Marie Oh Huber, who will become eBay's General Counsel; and former NYSE executive Scott Cutler, who will lead StubHub.
The three executives round out the leadership team of eBay CEO-designee Devin Wenig, who is currently acting as president of the eBay Marketplaces unit.
"I am extremely pleased to welcome Hal, Marie and Scott to the eBay leadership team," Wenig said in a statement. "Hal is a global commerce expert, Marie is a top public company general counsel, and Scott is an expert in financial services and technology solutions. As we prepare to launch the new eBay, they add strong breadth and depth to my leadership team."
eBay announced last September that it would succumb to the demands of activist investor Carl Icahn, who pushed for the split from PayPal for more than a year. Current eBay CEO John Donahoe continually refused the investor's demands, but has since changed his tune.
Following the separation, eBay expects to refocus on becoming a commerce leader with approximately $9 billion in annual revenues.
