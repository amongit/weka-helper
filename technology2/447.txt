Hortonworks acquires SequenceIQ for speedy Hadoop in the cloud
Hortonworks announced today that it has acquired SequenceIQ, an open source provider of rapid deployment tools for Hadoop.

There's a new kind of computer in town and it's resides on an HDMI stick that's not much bigger than a pack of gum.
Hortonworks says it plans to incorporate SequenceIQ's portfolio into the Hortonworks Data Platform and ultimately transition the technology to the Apache Software Foundation.
Hortonworks, which kicked off its IPO last December, says the new technology will enable the company to better deliver on-demand Hadoop clusters in the cloud or to any environment that supports Docker containers.
No financial terms were disclosed, but Hortonworks says the transaction is expected to close sometime in second quarter.
Founded in 2014, Budapest-based SequenceIQ shares the open-source ethos practiced by Hortonworks. The company has contributed to existing Apache Software Foundation projects in the past, like when it integrated its Cloudbreak and Periscope platforms with Apache Ambari and Apache Hadoop YARN.
The deal marks the second acquisition for Hortonworks, following its purchase of Hadoop security specialist XA Secure last year. Following that deal, Hortonworks donated XA Secure's IP to the Apache Software Foundation, forming the core of the Apache Ranger project.
