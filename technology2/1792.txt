| Image 1 of 9

I tested three Aukey external battery chargers against each other: a 3600mAh, ultra slim,portable charger with a Li-polymer battery in black, an 10,000mAh quick charger model in silver and a 2-IN-1 4400mAh alloy external battery charger and cigarette lighter.
I tested the chargers on three different phones: A Nokia Lumia 1520 running Windows Phone 8.1, A Blackberry 9720 platform 9.105.0.16 and a Samsung Galaxy S4 running Lollipop (Android 5.0.1)

This is a lightweight charger with a slim form factor. Although made out of plastic It seems well built, although it can be flexed slightly. It weighs 3.1 ounces. The charging cable is black and fits into the USB port snugly. Trying to use the white cables from the other chargers resulted in a poor fit, and would not charge the Lumia phone. The box contains a grey carrying case and an Aukey green suction pad. Its output is DC 5 volts at 1.5 Amps.
