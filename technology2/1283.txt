HTC One M9 available for order tomorrow, in US carrier stores on 10 April
Matthew's review of the HTC One M9 went live on Sunday and today, 9:01 pm Pacific, you will be able to order your own HTC One M9 from HTC.com for $649.
The model you purchase from HTC will arrive prior to the 10 April in-store launch. HTC will also be offering a 12-month interest-free payment option for the One M9.
The SIM-unlocked model available from HTC will be have the AT&T SKU so T-Mobile customers may not have full wireless radio functionality. Specific carrier model pricing, colors, and contract details are currently being provided from carriers. The HTC One M9 will appear in retail stores starting on 10 April.
All HTC One M9 buyers in the US will have covered by the Uh Oh Protection Plan that puts you at ease when using your phone. My current plan is to pre-order a T-Mobile version, likely in dual tone silver and gold.
HTC Americas president, Jason Mackenzie, stated:
The HTC One M9 has the zippy Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, 3GB of RAM, 20 megapixel rear camera, front facing UltraPixel camera, microSD card slot, and more. Typical of HTC, the design is fantastic and will please HTC fans.
T-Mobile: T-Mobile customers will be able to pre-order an HTC One M9 starting tomorrow at 6:00 am Pacific, Un-carrier customers can place their HTC One M9 pre-orders on T-Mobile.com or in T-Mobile stores for $0 down (and $27.08 a month for 24 months) for early access to the device. The device will be delivered to these customers before it hits the stores.
AT&T: The HTC One M9 will ship the same day if the order is received by 11:00 a.m. Pacific. The smartphone will be available in AT&T retail stores nationwide starting Friday, April 10 in gold on silver and gunmetal gray.
The HTC One M9 will be available at $0 down on an AT&T Next plan for $23.64 with AT&T Next 24, $29.55 with AT&T Next 18, or $35.45 with AT&T Next 12. The device can also be purchased at $199.99 with a two-year agreement, or at no annual commitment for $708.99. It's less expensive to buy the unlocked one from HTC directly and you won't get the AT&T bloatware so there is no reason to purchase the no contract one from AT&T.
