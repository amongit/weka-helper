Microsoft's Outlook.com e-mail service down for some users
Some users of Microsoft's Outlook.com e-mail service are reporting problems syncing and sending their mail.
The Outlook.com status dashboard indicates the service is down for a number of users, specifically those using Windows Live Mail, Outlook Connector, MSN Premium client Windows Phone 8.1 and the Windows 8 Mail Client.

According to the dashboard, the problems began around 12:30 a.m. PT/3:30 a.m. ET on April 8.
The latest status update, posted near 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, noted that "Fixing the problem is taking longer than we hoped. We'll provide an update by April 08 5:00 AM. We apologize for the lengthy interruption in service."
One user, Steve Lithgow (@waycoolkennel on Twitter) said Outlook.com is now up, but Exchange Active Sync isn't working.
"We have half dozen users with same error. 85010014 error," Lithgow tweeted.
I've asked Microsoft for an update as to what's going on and when the company expects the issues to be resolved.
Update: After several hours of no updates to the Outlook.com status dashboard, a Microsoft spokesperson sent an update (1:45 p.m. ET)
"We have rolled out a fix to address this issue. The fix will take time to resolve and we expect all services to be fully restored by later today Pacific Time. Impacted users can continue to access email via Outlook.com and any unaffected client."
No word (so far) on what caused the sync issues, which I've heard from a number of users have resulted in their inability to send/receive Outlook.com mail since Tuesday, not just today.
