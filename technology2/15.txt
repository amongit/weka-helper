Two scientists from the University of California, Berkeley are using crowdsourcing to help map the location of edible weeds across a number of neighbourhoods in California.
Their findings and those of others on the project are being logged on an app called iNaturalist.
The project hopes to pinpoint the location of edible weeds and also test samples for nutritional content and toxic contamination.
BBC Click's Richard Taylor talked to Philip Stark and Tom Carlson, two professors of statistics taking part in the Berkeley Edible Weeds Project.
