Acer launches first Chromebase all-in-one PC with touch display

Lost amid all the other Chrome-related news this week -- the launch of the Chromebit, Asus' Chromebook Flip -- is Acer's latest attempt to put Google's OS into a desktop. Its new Chromebase isn't the first on the market -- LG released its own model last year -- but it is the first to comes with a touchscreen.
Merely dubbed the Acer Chromebase, it includes a 21.5-inch 1080p display like LG's version, but thanks to its 178-degree viewing angle, the Acer screen makes it easier to use the touch functions of Chrome. It's also wall-mountable, which means the touchscreen can be used in public areas in a kiosk-like scenario.
Unlike the LG Chromebase, the Acer all-in-one features a Nvidia Tegra K1 processor instead of an Intel Celeron CPU. According to The Verge, the Acer Chromebase will have up to 4GB of RAM and come with 16GB of built-in storage. The company also throws in 100GB of cloud storage via Google Drive. Connectivity includes USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, built-in 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, and HDMI output.
Acer says the Chromebase will be available in the second quarter, but has not provided any pricing details yet. With the new desktop, the company hopes to add to its leadership with Chrome devices (which already includes Chromebox mini PCs), which Gartner estimates at 36 percent of market share (according to Acer).
