Star Wars HD digital release coming to your smartphone and tablet on 10 April
I was eight years old when the first Star Wars appeared in theaters in 1977 and the movies have been a part of my life since then. My home office theme is Star Wars, my online user name was created from my favorite character Han Solo, and the easy gift for me is anything related to Star Wars.
As I was watching the NCAA Final Four last night I saw a commercial appear that made my Fitbit Surge heart rate sensor spike on the charts. Star Wars is making its digital debut this Friday, 10 April, and as a heavy mobile device user I cannot wait to get it on all my devices to view as I commute, travel for business, and enjoy the saga on the road.
Star Wars fans are excited for the release of the next Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens, in the 2015 holiday season. It's directed by J.J. Abrams and set approximately 30 years after Return of the Jedi. Walt Disney now owns Lucasfilm and I can't wait to see this new series and share it with another generation.
Star Wars has been released a few times on different mediums and with enhancements, but this is the first official digital release. All six films will be available along with special features that include conversations with key contributors, discoveries from the inside episodes, deleted scenes, and more. Unfortunately, these HD copies do not include the original untouched release I grew up with as a young boy.
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated:
You can pre-order the movies on the Google Play Store for $19.99 each or the entire collection for $89.99, saving yourself $29.95. My total order with tax was $97.10.
The Star Wars collection is also available for pre-order on iTunes, Xbox Video, and Amazon. Find your favorite platform and get ready for a Star Wars marathon weekend.
