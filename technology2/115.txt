Foxconn to sell more products through 7-Eleven in Taiwan
The partnership between Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, and President Chain Store, which operates the 7-Eleven retail chain in Taiwan, has been further expanded to include the sale of more consumer tech products at the convenience store.
President Chain on Tuesday introduced the addition of a 7-inch tablet and multimedia-sharing device, that supports wireless transfer of video from smartphones, tablets, and notebooks to LCD TVs, at a bundled price of NT$6,990 (US$235).
The announcement comes after the retail chain successfully sold 15,000 units of 40-inch, 60-inch, and 70-inch Foxconn-produced LCD TV in the first three months. It said many consumers of large-sized LCD TV were hunting for products online at its shopping portal, the 7net. The President Chain's e-commerce website in July began selling Foxconn-manufacturered LCD TV, called Open Chan TV, in Taiwan.
To further target the potential LCD TV consumer market, the retail chain operator also unveiled a new 50-inch Internet-connected LCD TV developed by Foxconn, at a retail price of NT$19,999 (US$678).
According to state-run Central News Agency, by end-2013, 7Net is planning to expand its sale of various new Foxconn-developed consumer tech products to include low-cost smartphones, notebooks, desktops, portable TV, and even 80-inch LCD TV.
President Chain said it aims to sell 3,000 tablets a month to gain a market share of 5 percent in Taiwan. "In our pipeline are 5 to 10 new products made by Hon Hai, including smartphone products," Hong-cheng Liu, head of 7net, said in a Taipei Times report.
In a report Wednesday by Taipei-based DigiTimes, the new Foxconn tablet features a Marvell-developed ARM quad-core processor, 7-inch 1280 by 800 IPS touch-screen, 1GB RAM and 16GB ROM, 5-megapixel rear camera, and a 2-megapixel front camera, and weighs 310g.
The price set by the new Foxconn tablet might not beat other similar products available in the market, which are priced about US$202, however, President Chain pointed to the feature in the multimedia sharing device which enables users to share video easily.
