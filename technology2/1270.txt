Is this the LG G4? Korean website shows off most of the details
We understand invites were sent out to some press outlets for a LG event later in April. Evan Blass posted the link that appears to show a Korean LG G4 staging site where many details of this new phone are available.
The specifications page doesn't look to be fully updated yet with Android KitKat shown as the OS, which is obviously wrong since all 2015 flagship devices are launching the Android 5.x Lollipop. The camera resolution may also not be correct with other rumors stating it was going to be a 16 megapixel shooter.
The LG G4 camera looks to be one of the best on the market with the following features:

Specifications that look likely include:
The standard LG rear buttons are found again here on the LG G4. Wireless charging may be included, but given that the specifications page doesn't look to be final I am not sure what standards may be supported here.
Software features of the LG G4 include Smart Notice 2.0, Smart Calendar, and speedy image gallery.
It appears consumers will be able to buy backs in plastic or leather with a variety of leather colors available. The back is removable with a battery and microSD expansion card slot under the back cover. It looks like LG may be the last major manufacturer still offering this functionality and I'm sure many Android fans will be pleased to see this.
Does the likely coming release of the LG G4 change your mind about the Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge or HTC One M9? I already returned the M9, but the LG G4 is causing me to take another look at my Galaxy S6 Edge.
