| Image 1 of 6

Dell's Black Friday advert, leaked by Bestblackfriday.com, reveals that the company is planning to offer PCs at discounted rates. Included within the tech giant's offerings is the Inspiron 15 laptop for $189.99. It isn't the most powerful machine on the planet — sporting 4GB RAM, Intel Celeron processors and a 500GB hard drive — but runs Windows 8.1 on the operating system and comes with a 15.1-inch screen. For those seeking a budget laptop to replace an old machine or as a gift for a student, this could be the deal for you.

Apple often surfaces in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday rushes, and this year is no exception. The iPad mini 2 and MacBook Air are both on offer this year, which not only could suit someone looking for their first tablet, but business users who need a lightweight, powerful laptop for travel.
The iPad mini 2 will be on offer at Staples for $239 . In addition, Apple's MacBook Air will be on sale, courtesy of Best Buy. While the range is on offer, the best bargains are the basic 11-inch version for $779.99 — $120 off — and the non-retina display MacBook Pro, which comes in at $899.00.

Bargain tablets can not only make great Christmas gifts, but can also be useful for students and as a basic workplace tool. We're likely to see many different offers this year as the market becomes congested, but some of the top picks and cheapest we know of thanks to advert leaks include a Walmart selection for under $100 . In particular, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite, on offer for $99, is a robust 7-inch tablet suitable for basic requirements with a 1.2GHz processor, 8GB storage and a 2MP camera.
Walmart is also offering the Misfit activity tracker for $24.

Microsoft, beyond a number of Xbox deals potentially launched to combat rival Sony's popular PlayStation 4, will be offering the Nokia Lumia 635 smartphone free with an AT&T contract. The Lumia model is equipped with a 4.5-inch display, 5MP camera, 8GB storage and runs on the Windows Phone operating system.

Sears is offering the Canon EOS Rebel T5, a decent DSLR for $399, a saving of $150. While there's nothing particularly notable about this camera — most DSLRs in this price range are pretty much the same — the camera does the job and can be improved with a decent lens. However, for entry-level users and individuals with an interest in photography, this isn't a bad camera to invest in.
