Facebook suggests more privacy tips for keeping user accounts secure

Although Facebook is most prominently known for being a digital hub for just about sharing anything and everything (to a fault), the social network realizes some users want to keep certain things on the down low.

Facebook at Work: Thanks, but no thanks
It makes sense for Facebook to tap into other markets -- but the enterprise isn't one of them.
Thus, Facebook is uploading an additional library of best practices for keeping user accounts more secure and private.
Described as "modules" by company developers, the 11 new interactive lessons are being added to Facebook Privacy Basics, which launched last November as the first step in response to user demand for better privacy controls and tips.
"After seeing how interested people are in material like this, we discovered that they also had questions about our security tools," said Melissa Luu-Van, a product manager at Facebook, in a blog post on Friday.
Some of the new lessons range from simple but vital priorities such as creating better passwords to more heightened states of alertness, including recognizing when someone is actually trying to steal account information or passwords.
Facebook also provided further insights into how it responds to user account and data requests from government agencies, offering a more visually-friendly version of its routine transparency reports.
The new privacy modules are available now in 40 languages worldwide and are accessible via smartphones, tablets and desktop channels.
