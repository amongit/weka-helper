Qualcomm, Cerner collaborate on smart heath tech for in-home care
Qualcomm is teaming with healthcare IT firm Cerner to foster smart health technology for in-home care.
The companies will work together on technology that enables care providers to remotely monitor chronically ill patients in near-real time, which could allow for more proactive and personalized treatment plans.
Jorno folding keyboard for iOS, Android, and Windows: High-quality construction and design
The Jorno folding keyboard started with a Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and since has morphed into a capable design. It features a keyboard that folds into a very small package at quitting time.
As part of the agreement, Cerner will tap into Qualcomm Life's FDA-listed platform 2net to capture data from medical devices and sensors within a patient's home, such as weight scales, blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters.
Cerner could then transmit that data to its own customers, typically care providers, using the CareAware device connectivity platform and Cerner's electronic health record system.
"As the industry transitions from episodic care within acute care settings to continuous care, available away from the bedside, there is a need for a secure, medical-grade connectivity solution, which our 2net Platform provides," said Rick Valencia, GM and SVP of Qualcomm Life, the chipmaker's health tech arm.
The partnership between the companies comes on the heels of Cerner's jump into the Apple Watch health-app ecosystem. The company announced last week that it was launching an app on the smart watch that would help users collect biometric information such as weight, blood pressure and blood sugar values.
