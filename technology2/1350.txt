Twilio adds video services

Twilio, which offers a cloud communication platform to enterprises, said Tuesday that it will roll out video as well as a software development kit (SDK).
The Industry Cloud: Why It's Next
Coud computing has engulfed lots of IT, but one of the untapped regions of the tech and business world is the industry cloud, focusing on vertical industries and more specialized applications.
For Twilio, the move into video adds a key piece to its communications platform. Twilio provides voice and messaging around the world to companies such as Uber, The Home Depot, Salesforce, Intuit and Coca-Cola.
The company said that it will use the WebRTC standard to make it easy to embed video services into apps, software services, browsers and Web sites. Twilio already provides more than one billion voice minutes a year and is hoping video will up usage.
According to Twilio, the WebRTC video will run through its 28 data centers in seven regions. Software libraries will cover client-side deployments. Twilio's move highlights how video services are becoming more critical to enterprises for collaboration and customer support. The latter is probably going to be more critical.
Twilio said it will support up to 4-way peer-to-peer calling, unlimited video connections, low latency relay and a mobile stack to deploy video on mobile platforms. Zendesk, which provides cloud customer service, will also support Twilio Video.
