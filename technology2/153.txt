Accenture boosts big data services with Cloudera alliance
Global systems integrator and consulting company Accenture is aligning itself more closely with Cloudera, with the aim of providing its clients with access to the service provider's Apache Hadoop-powered enterprise data hub.
The relationship will focus on helping Accenture clients use the Cloudera platform as an option for storing their data and offloading big data enterprise workloads such as batch processing, interactive SQL, enterprise search and advanced analytics.
The benefits are pretty straightforward: the joint solution is supposed to accelerate the speed with which enterprises can speed decision-making. What's more, the structure of the data doesn't really matter -- it can range from text to social media content. The services around the new alliance will include Hadoop training and industry-specific consulting expertise related to governance and data protection concerns.
"Cloudera's offering and vision for a data management platform aligns with Accenture's digital, analytics and big data strategy and requirements," said Tom Reilly, CEO of Cloudera, in a statement.
The new relationship complements an alliance that Accenture forged back in April with Liaison Technologies, which is focused on solutions for life sciences companies.
