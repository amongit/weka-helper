Softros LAN Messenger comes to OS X

A very handy tool that was once only available to Windows users finally comes to OS X.
One of the first utilities that I would install onto any new Windows system coming into the PC Doc HQ was Softros LAN Messenger. Why? Because it was the best network communication tool that I'd ever come across. Secure, private, and totally serverless, Softros LAN Messenger allowed messages and files to be sent to other users on the network, even if they were offline at the time.
When I moved from Windows to OS X, this was one of the biggest things that I missed. Sure, there were third-party apps and services I could use to send messages and files between Windows and OS X systems, but none gave me the performance, security or ease of use that Softros LAN Messenger offered.
Well, now for $12.95 a seat, I can unify the messaging system on all my Windows (Windows 2000 to Windows 8.1) and Macs (OS X 10.9 and OS X 10.10), and let me tell you, this is something that's going to make my life a lot easier.
If you're looking for a messaging and file transfer solution for a network consisting of Windows PCs and Macs, then I suggest you give Softros LAN Messenger a whirl (there's a free trial available).
