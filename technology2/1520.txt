Apple fixes FREAK security flaw with iOS 8.2 update

The latest release of Apple's mobile operating system fixes a serious flaw for iPhones and iPads, which if exploited could lead to an attacker to intercept encrypted connections.
iOS 8.2, released Monday following the media event in San Francisco, fixes the so-called "FREAK" flaw in the company's range of products.
The flaw could allow an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on common encrypted networks, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections.
Other major companies, including Microsoft and Google have products and services affected by the bug.
Apple said in an advisory note the flaw affects iPhone 4s handsets and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, and iPad 2 and later.
Users who think they are affected by the bug can run a client checking tool, and should upgrade to iOS 8.2 sooner rather than later.
