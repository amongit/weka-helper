A child abuse watchdog says it has helped to identify and remove more than double the number of sexually explicit web pages depicting youngsters in 2014 - than in the previous year.
The UK-based Internet Watch Foundation said it assisted in the removal of more than 31,000 pages last year, compared with just over 13,000 in 2013.
Angus Crawford report.
