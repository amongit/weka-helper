Samsung prices for the wireless charging system too high? Fear not! There are alternatives that you can pick up starting at less than $15.
Here are six I suggest you take a look at:
Not only are these charging pads compatible with the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, but they will also work with other Qi-compatible devices. Some, such as the TYLT Vu, come with receiver cards that allow them to be used in devices that don't have built-in support for wireless charging.

With the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung has moved away from plastic to adopt a seamless, full metal and glass construction. The glass comes in the form of the highly durable Gorilla Glass 4, and the glass has been treated with a special reflective material on the inside to give it a highly jeweled finish.

The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge will be offered in White Pearl, Black Sapphire, and Gold Platinum options, along with a special Blue Topaz for the Galaxy S6, and Green Emerald for the Galaxy S6 Edge.
