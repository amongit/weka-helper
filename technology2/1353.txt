Microsoft, Dropbox integrate Dropbox with Office Online
Microsoft and Dropbox are continuing to expand their partnership.
On April 9, the pair announced that users can add their Dropbox cloud storage accounts to Office Online, enabling them to browse, open and edit Office files when using the Webified version of Office. Users also can create new files in Office Online and save them directly to their Dropboxes.
All Dropbox and Office Online users have access to this new level of integration as of today, April 9.
Last November, Microsoft and Dropbox partnered to allow users to access Dropbox directly from Office applications installed on their devices and edit those Office files inside the Dropbox app. Those capabilities rolled out for Dropbox users on iOS and Android.Back in November.
Microsoft and Dropbox officials also said that Dropbox for Business users with Office 365 licenses also would be getting this functionality. As of today, April 9, that integration is now available.
Dropbox also has developed, as promised last fall, apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8 tablets.
