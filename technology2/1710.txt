Oracle, EMC's VCE, Cisco integrated system standouts, says IDC
Integrated systems sales surged in the fourth quarter and 2014 as Oracle, VCE and Cisco were standouts, according to IDC data.
IDC said that integrated systems and platform revenue surged 19.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago to $2.7 billion. For 2014, integrated systems revenue was $9.4 billion, up 28.9 percent from 2013.
The research firm breaks down integrated systems between platform and infrastructure. Infrastructure covers integrated compute, storage and networking building blocks designed for multiple workloads. Integrated platform systems refer to combinations preloaded with optimized software such as applications and databases.
When it comes to revenue, integrated infrastructure is selling faster. Integrated platform revenue was flat in the fourth quarter.
In the integrated platform market, Oracle and its Exa- line of systems has more than 40 percent of the market with IBM a distant second place.
For integrated infrastructure, the market is dominated by VCE and Cisco and its various partners. EMC recently bought out Cisco to control VCE. However, Cisco has its Unified Computing System and rakes in revenue via storage partnerships with NetApp and EMC.
Now that VCE is controlled by EMC it'll be clear that the integrated infrastructure market will be still dominated by two players---EMC and Cisco. Here's a look at the standings.
