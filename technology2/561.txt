Virgin Media serves up all-you-can-eat mobile data
Virgin Media has launched a tariff that features all-you-can-eat data, offering it at a discount to existing customers of the company's TV and broadband services.
The new Premiere tariff costs £26 per month and includes unlimited texts and data, 2,500 monthly voice minutes, bundled phone insurance and a pre-installed Mobile Rescue remote security app. It requires signing up to a two-year contract, and existing Virgin Media customers get £5 off each month.
The company also unveiled several other cheaper tariffs, as well as a range of contract-free, SIM-only deals for those who already have a smartphone. Virgin's new tariffs also come with three months of free Spotify usage.
Three and T-Mobile also offer all-you-can-eat data on, respectively, their One and Full Monty plans.
