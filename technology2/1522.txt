Apple will reveal its next mobile software version later this year, likely around June when the company has its annual developer conference.
Since the release of iOS 7, the company has faced criticism and pushback from users who have held off upgrading or complained about bugs or issues that have hampered their experience. The company is expected to focus on bug fixes over feature improvements in its latest software, iOS 9, in an effort to appease those who have felt the software has fallen short of Apple's typically high quality bar.
Here are some of the things we hope to see fixed.

One of the biggest criticisms of iOS 8, the latest version of the iPhone and iPad software, is the considerable space it takes up. Many had to remove apps, games, photos, and music in order to upgrade the software. (The latest iterative version, iOS 8.1.3, aimed to fix this.)
Most of the apps hold onto a vast cache of data that could be deleted instead of removing a user's content. Apple should let its users remove old application data that's no longer needed.

The company's mobile payment service, Apple Pay, is currently restricted to the US market. The free service took off, but has yet to reach other markets. It's hoped that China, a big market for Apple, will be one of the later expanded markets for the mobile wallet service. Some companies like online retail giant Alibaba are said to be positive on a partnership in the coming future. Other markets could be on the list, including the UK, Europe, and Asia.

Before you sync your iCloud or reinstall your apps, there are privacy settings that need locking down on your iPhone or iPad. Otherwise these holes could leave your data and privacy wide open. Apple should ensure some of these privacy features are enabled by default, or at least highlighted during the setup process.

iPhones and iPads running the latest software now come with a hidden-away feature to show you how to cut down on your battery consumption. Most devices can't last a full day on a single charge. Batteries aren't improving that much, and devices getting smaller, thinner, and lighter isn't going to help things. A battery-saving mode could help users at least squeeze out an extra hour or two without having to fiddle around with all the settings.

Many iPad owners in particular have families with multiple users. Android devices have a multi-user mode with various settings with restrictions for children of different ages. Apple already does this with its Mac software, why not extend it to the iPad?

Many Apple owners are suffering from "show-stopper" bugs that some argue should have been caught before the software shipped, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues and a calendar syncing problems. After shipping 74 million iPhones in a single three-month period over Christmas, you would think the company would have tried to fix some of these issues before anyone noticed.

One of the core features of iPhones, the most popular device for iOS software, is the camera. Apple's made some considerable improvements to the camera in the past year but it's still a step behind some of its competitors. Can Apple make taking photos fun again?

The quick-access menu, dubbed the Control Center, is a swipe-up from anywhere on your iPhone or iPad. But its options can't be changed. Different users will want different things -- access to different services, apps, and features. Making these options customizable would greatly improve productivity for some.

Apple founded the mobile app store revolution back in an early revised iteration of the iPhone. Now, some apps like browsers or office productivity suites are used more than others. Apple still doesn't allow users to select a default app outside its own, unlike Android. Will iOS 9 see this feature change?

iOS 8 and its desktop operating system counterpart, OS X Yosemite, work in conjunction to allow users to work on one app on a mobile device and seamlessly transition to another device. This will hopefully improve in coming versions of the desktop and mobile operating systems, with an eye on bringing Siri to the desktop and other Mac-focused features to Apple's mobile devices.

Two-factor authentication utilizes a mobile device to prove a user is who they say they are. It can considerably cut down the chance of unauthorized intrusions. In the wake of alleged breaches of celebrities' iCloud accounts, Apple added this feature to its online accounts as well as email notifications to inform users of potentially unwanted access. Adding this as a core feature in iOS 9 would greatly improve user security.

But of all things, most users probably want stability over features and functionality. Recent reports point to iOS 9 having a "huge" stability and optimization focus in an effort for users to fall in love with their devices again. Some have even said that the latest version of Android 5.0 "Lollipop" is more stable than iOS 8. All too often there are bugs, flaws, and glitches in the software. Many will want basic fixes to long-standing problems over anything new or flashy.
