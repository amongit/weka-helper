Project Mosul was set up in response to online footage that showed members of Islamic State vandalising the Mosul Museum in Iraq.
The initiative aims to crowd source pictures of items that were on display in the museum and then digitally recreate them in 3D.
Those behind the project hope that by using this technology, as well as 3D printing, they will be able to preserve the spirit of what was lost in the destruction.
BBC Click's spoke to Matthew Vincent about the project and his hopes to expand it around the world in the future.
