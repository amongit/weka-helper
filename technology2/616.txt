Alex Daley of Casey Research talks Bitcoin (Podcast)

Getting paid in Bitcoin: These businesses are ready for it - but are their customers?
I liked Alex and his manner of speaking so much in the video that I sought him out for an interview. His experience in the financial business, his investment strategies, his history as a developer all make him a very compelling force in the financial sector. He is also very much against my favorite crypto-nemesis, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not so lucky and I think a lot of people are realizing that this fad currency is just silly as a currency and a very high risk as an investment. For something that should have stayed in fantasy worlds such as WoW, Mt. Gox, Silk Roads 1 & 2, and Second Life, Bitcoin has made it onto the radars of a few innocent people and a gaggle of not-so-innocent pump-and-dumpers.
During the forty-three minute podcast discussion, Alex and I touch on several Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related topics such as credit/lending, Bitcoin's current price drop, the long-term hope for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and some interesting discussion about money and currency in general. I think you'll find Alex to be a great resource and an eloquent speaker on money, cryptocurrencies, and market outlooks.
