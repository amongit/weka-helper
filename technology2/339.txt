Brazilian print startup wins high-profile tech award
Brazilian B2B print startup Printi was the big winner at a high-profile technology awards ceremony focused on the Latin America region.
Printi won the best B2B company award and its founder, German-born Florian Hagenbuch won the entrepreneur of the year accolade at the Latam Founders awards event in SÃ£o Paulo earlier this week.
The Brazilian print company provides services to corporate clients, from business cards to catalogues online. Printi's differential is that its algorithms aggregate orders, allowing it to save by buying products in bulk from factories. It also allows customers to customize and save products with web tools.
