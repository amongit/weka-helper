How to add wireless charging to your iPhone

| Image 1 of 12












Want to know something that many smartphones can do that your iPhone cannot? Wireless charging. Fortunately, it's a feature that's easy to add.
Here's what you need:
Pop the wireless charging card into your iPhone's connector, fold it over the back, and pop it into a case and you're done. You do lose the port on your phone (unless you're willing to disconnect the card) but if all you use it for is charging, then this won't be too much of a hardship.
With a compatible charger (such as this one) you can continue to charge your iPhone in a car too.
It's a system that works very well, and makes charging easy. Also, since Qi-compatible charging pads are so affordable, you can have one at home, in the car, and at the office.
