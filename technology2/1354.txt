VMware launches collaboration bundle, combines Socialcast, AirWatch wares
VMware on Wednesday launched a collaboration bundle that combines AirWatch products with its Socialcast application to create a suite.
AirWatch, the mobile device management arm of VMware, is betting that a larger channel presence and a knack for bundling will bolster its market share in a crowded market. VMware acquired AirWatch in February 2014 and Socialcast in May 2011.

VMware's collaboration suite includes AirWatch's Content Locker file sync and sharing tools, Socialcast enterprise social networking and AirWatch Video. VMware has used previous acquired products to integrate them with applications ranging from the data center to front end devices.

Like most suite efforts, the pitch is that there's a best-of-breed technology stack from one vendor. VMware said its Collaboration Bundle will aggregate content across mobile devices, provide data loss prevention, broadcast information, identify experts and connect people and processes.
Pricing wasn't available.
