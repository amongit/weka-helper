Aviation leads the way in the 2015 Uptime Institute Brill awards
The Uptime Institute Brill awards are designed to recognize leaders in the design and operation of data center facilities worldwide. Named for the late founder of the Institute, this second year of awards, with nominees from vendors, end users, and services providers was highlighted by the selection of two entrants from the aviation world as the award winners.

The Global Leadership Award winners, The Boeing Company and United Airlines Inc, were selected from the standard applicants because of the judge's perception that they had shown excellence across multiple disciplines and/or regions; there is no specific criteria beyond this and the judgment of the selection panel and Global Leaders can come from any region or category.
Boeing was selected because of its "holistic approach to IT"; it was able to achieve cost reductions almost across the board by investing in more energy efficient hardware technologies, higher density racking, and infrastructure changes that all resulted in reductions in both CAPEX and OPEX.
UAL got the nod because of the huge consolidation effort involved in its 3-year-old merger with Continental Airlines, creation of new efficient data center facilities, and the success in its merger of of IT management structures into a Critical Infrastructure Services group that brought data centers, reservation centers, and airport IT assets under a single group worldwide.
These two winners were picked from a large group of entrants who had submitted nominations in the five categories of award recognition:
These applicants are judged by geographic region:
