HTC announces One M9+ with Duo Camera and fingerprint sensor for Chinese market
HTC's One M9, see my review, is launching on US carriers this Friday, but we also now see that the Chinese market is getting an interesting cousin called the HTC One M9+.
The HTC One M9+ has a slightly larger 5.2 inch display with 2K resolution, MediaTek Helio X10 processor, 20-megapixel Duo Camera, front facing UltraPixel camera, and fingerprint sensor. The device has the same dual tone color options and design as the M9, along with front facing HTC BoomSound speakers.
The Duo Camera on the M8 was a fun way to capture photos to share with family and friends and I wish the M9 would have kept that secondary sensor around to offer a unique feature over other smartphone.
Jorno folding keyboard for iOS, Android, and Windows: High-quality construction and design
The Jorno folding keyboard started with a Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and since has morphed into a capable design. It features a keyboard that folds into a very small package at quitting time.
The One M9+ fingerprint sensor is not a home button like the iPhone and Galaxy S6, but does implement finger placement rather than finger scrolling like the HTC One Max did last year.
HTC issued the following statement:
HTC's focus outside of China is on the HTC One M9. The higher display resolution and fingerprint sensor aren't something I care too much about, but I would have liked the Duo Camera on the M9.
