Emirates readies Apple Watch app ahead of Apr 24 launch
Emirates has unveiled an app for Apple Watch a week ahead of the actual availability of the wearable device.
The Dubai-based airline described the app an extension of its iPhone app and built to provide "context-specific data" such as flight status updates.
Alex Knigge, senior vice president of digital at Emirates, said: "The Apple Watch platform allows us to connect with travelers on a more personal level by providing real-time information throughout their journey. Our team developed the Emirates app for Apple Watch with modern travelers in mind, making sure this wearable technology delivers key information with a simple glance at their wrist."
Passengers who purchase an Apple Watch when it's available from April 24 will need to install the Emirates app on their iPhone to access its various features, including viewing their upcoming trips as well as accessing real-time flight information such as terminal and gate number and baggage collection details.
The app supports three languages including English, French, and German.
