One month with the new Chromebook Pixel: Still impressive for my needs
My, how time flies. I've been using the latest Google Chromebook Pixel for a full 30 days, thanks to a review unit loaned to me by Google. Back in 2013, I spent $1,449 for my own Pixel with integrated LTE and after a month of using the newer model, I'm convinced that Google fixed the few things wrong with the first edition while keeping the great keyboard, trackpad and high resolution display.

Right off the bat, this year's model is a little lighter on the wallet. I've been testing the base $999 model with 2.2GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and 32GB of local storage. You can also spend $1,299 to double up on memory and storage capacity, plus get a chip upgrade to a Core i7, but I don't see the need for most people to do so. The less expensive model has never left me wanting for more performance in the past month.
The biggest difference I see between the 2013 model and the latest Chromebook Pixel is in the battery life. Instead of the roughly five hours of run-time on a single charge I've been living with for two years, this new Pixel hasn't yet failed to get me through a full day of use.
It helps that the latest Intel Core i5 is at least two generations removed from the chip inside the 2013 Chromebook Pixel. The processor is far more efficient this time around, allowing me to routinely get 11 to 12 hours of use on a single charge. But it gets better in real-world usage thanks to the included quick charge capability of the new laptop. Plug in for 15 minutes and you'll get a whopping two additional hours of battery life, for example. From a fully dead battery, you can re-charge the new Pixel in about one hour and 40 minutes.
I've been using the quick charge feature as part of my daily routine, in fact. Typically, I'll end my day with a good 25 percent charge left on the Pixel and often plug it in overnight. If I forget, all is not lost.
