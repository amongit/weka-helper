Stitch Labs integrates with Magento to stregthen sales channel, inventory synching
Inventory management firm Stitch Labs has integrated with eBay's open-source e-commerce platform Magento, the company announced on Tuesday.
The integration will enable small business sellers using Stitch to add Magento as a sales channel, and to sync inventory with other channels such as Amazon and Square.
As of today, Magento sellers can log in to the Stitch dashboard to view drill-down sales reports, item quantities and channel performance, the companies said.

Stitch Labs' cloud-based tools focus on funneling inventory and customer information to a central location, so that sales orders, invoices and shipping processes can be handled from a single application.
Stitch integrated with Square last year in a partnership that linked the point-of-sale and inventory muscle of each company. The basic gist of Stitch integrating with players in the e-commerce, small-business seller space is to make itself more appealing to those sellers who do business across multiple platforms.
"We're very excited to add Magento to the Stitch community," said Brandon Levey, CEO of Stitch Labs, in prepared remarks. "We are focused on enabling commerce wherever it happens, and are very excited to expand our network of offerings for Stitch users. The data we provide our customers will only be made stronger by channel integrations like Magento."
