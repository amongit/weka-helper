Hortonworks, IBM and Pivotal begin shipping standardized Hadoop
Earlier today at the Hadoop Summit in Brussels, Hortonworks, IBM and Pivotal announced that their respective Hadoop platforms are all standardized on the Open Data Platform (ODP) and ready to ship.
First announced back in February, the ODP is an industry effort designed to simplify the adoption of Apache Hadoop for the enterprise by ensuring that all versions of Hadoop are based on the same Apache core.

The Jorno folding keyboard started with a Kickstarter campaign in 2012, and since has morphed into a capable design. It features a keyboard that folds into a very small package at quitting time.
That core is made up of Apache Hadoop 2.6, including HDFS, YARN and MapReduce, as well as Apache Ambari software for scaling managed Hadoop environments.
According to Hortonworks, the benefits of the ODP extend to both industry members and enterprise customers. For the members/vendors in the ODP ecosystem, it allows them to only have to verify their products once, against that aforementioned Apache core. As for enterprise customers, they should see an uptick in Hadoop choices and big data apps, assuming the ecosystem behaves as expected.
"Aligning around a common core of Apache Hadoop means tearing down complexity and building interoperability across the Hadoop ecosystem," said Shaun Connolly, VP of corporate strategy for Hortonworks.
Members of the ODP initiative include GE, Hortonworks, IBM, Infosys, Pivotal, SAS, and Altiscale, Capgemini, CenturyLink, EMC, PLDT, Splunk, Teradata, Verizon, VMware and WANdisco.
Noticeably absent from the list are Hadoop distros Cloudera and MapR.
