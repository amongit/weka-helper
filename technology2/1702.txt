Citrix cuts Q1 outlook, cites multiple moving parts
Citrix on Thursday cut its outlook for the first quarter and said a mix of sales changes, restructuring, customer demand and currency led to the disappointment.
The company said that its first quarter revenue will be between $755 million and $760 million, well below the $780 million to $790 million projected by the company.
Non-GAAP earnings per share will be 63 cents a share to 65 cents a share, which is below the company's guidance of 70 cents a share to 72 cents a share. Wall Street was looking for first quarter revenue of $786.7 million with non-GAAP earnings of 72 cents a share.

In a statement, CEO Mark Templeton said the company is committed to its strategic initiatives and restructuring announced in the fourth quarter. He added:
Citrix's warning could be the beginning of a slew of them in the technology sector, which is struggling with a stronger dollar and spotty demand. Intel already cut its first quarter outlook.
