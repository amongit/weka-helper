â€‹Mobile security: Largely a non-issue...for now
There's great news on the mobile security front: There aren't many cyberattacks and the malware is relatively benign. As a result, there isn't much to worry about and enterprises should spend their efforts securing non-mobile infrastructure. The bad news: Mobile security will matter at some point, most likely when companies button up vulnerabilities elsewhere.

That takeaway sticks out in Verizon's 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report. Among the key things to know:
So mobile is way secure right? Not really, said Jay Jacobs, an author of Verizon's report and security analyst at the company. "Mobile is not a preferred vector for attack. It gets visibility, but isn't a focus," said Jacobs.
Cost of a data breach: 58 cents per record, says Verizon
Add it up and mobile just doesn't carry the dollar signs or glory that the desktop has. One reason is that smartphones and tablets don't have a lot of data on them and rely on corporate connections for valuable information. But the big reason is that cybercriminals have other easier targets to hit.

Think of mobile much like you do point of sale data breaches. Europe moved to chip and pin technology years ago and the U.S. decision to stick with magnetic strips for cards equated to a big welcome sign for cybercrime.
Once other areas of infrastructure are secured more, mobile may become a more enticing target.
Verizon said in its report:
Jacobs said that enterprises need to monitor mobile security, but not necessarily focus heavily on it. Mobile security will matter at some point, but for now visibility and control of devices is most important. From Verizon's report:
