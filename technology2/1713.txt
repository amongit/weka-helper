Samsung and Oracle team up to tap into China's logistics market
Samsung SDS and Oracle signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday, with Samsung set to use Oracle's global solution partner program to optimise the South Korean firm's solutions with the US giant's database, middleware, and system know-how to target the Chinese IT logistic market.
Samsung's solutions include a tracker that uses the Internet of Things, big data analysis, and supply chain management. Various analysis models and in-memory based high-performance big data platforms will be offered to Chinese clients, a Samsung SDS spokesman said.
Under the deal, Samsung would also apply Oracle's solutions to its datacentres in order to increase its cloud offering.
According to Gartner, the worldwide IT logistics market was worth $10.3 billion last year, and will grow 9.5 percent annually to reach $14.6 billion by 2018. China's will grow 16.2 percent per year in the period. The Chinese government is also actively fostering logistics businesses.
"Samsung SDS plans to continue to partner with various global markets to expand its solution businesses abroad," said the company spokesman.
