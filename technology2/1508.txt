The much ballyhooed Apple Watch went live for preorders this week. Existing supplies quickly sold out, but it's not clear if this was due to limited inventory or brisk sales.
The Watch will not get in buyers' hands before April 24, with many models already with delayed deliveries until the summer. The expensive gold edition is showing shipments occurring a week after other models.
