Forrester’s Hadoop predictions for 2015
But, how fast and far will Hadoop go heading into 2015?
Virtualizing the Enterprise
Virtualization has swept through the data center in recent years, enabling IT transformation and serving as the secret sauce behind cloud computing. Now it’s time to examine what’s next for virtualization as the data center options mature and virtualization spreads to desktops, networks, and beyond.
Prediction 4: The Hadoop skills shortage will disappear. Hadoop is not that hard to understand. It is a file system, albeit distributed, and it is a computing platform, albeit distributed. The APIs are Java. What’s the big deal? Digging in to a new open source platform and learning the APIs is nothing new to enterprise Java application developers. They have to do it continuously to keep up and keep their résumés fresh. Hadoop is no different. The shortage of Hadoop skills will quickly disappear as enterprises turn to their existing application development teams to implement projects such as filling data lakes and developing MapReduce jobs using Java. Let’s not forget about the operations skills needed to maintain a Hadoop cluster. Same thing. DevOps continuously deal with a complex heterogeneous environment. For those familiar with business intelligence, SQL on Hadoop will open the door to familiar access to their data. And while experienced technology management professionals take the bull by the horns, the open source community and commercial vendors are building better tools to make using Hadoop easier to use for everyone.
