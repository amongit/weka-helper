President Obama To Attend DCCC Fundraisers In Chicago
President Barack Obama will appear at two fundraisers on Wednesday night in his hometown of Chicago to raise money for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. This is the third time the president has appeared at fundraisers for the campaign arm of the House Democrats as they seek to reclaim control of the chamber from the Republican majority in 2014.
One event will be held at the Downtown Hilton just off of Lake Michigan, and another will be held at the home of Bettylu and Paul Saltzman, major Democratic donors and longtime patrons of the president.
The events are intended to help the DCCC continue its dominance over its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Despite Democrats being the minority in the chamber, the DCCC raised $28 million in the first four months of 2013, compared to $22.5 million for the NRCC. The DCCC currently has a $3.9 million net cash on hand advantage over the NRCC.
Obama's trip to Chicago should help pad the DCCC's coffers. In April, events the president attended for the DCCC in San Francisco helped net $3.25 million for the committee.
House Democratic leadership, including Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), DCCC Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), will appear at the Hilton event. Ticket prices range from $1,000 to $5,000. Members of Illinois' House Democratic delegation, including Reps. Cheri Bustos, Robin Kelly, Bill Foster, Bobby Rush and Jan Schakowsky, will also be attendance, along with Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Attending the fundraiser at the Saltzman home will cost donors between $10,000 and $32,400. It will also feature House Democratic leadership, along with former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley and former Obama political adviser David Axelrod, along with his wife, Susan Axelrod.
