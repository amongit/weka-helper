Democrats Set Date For 2016 Nominating Convention
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Democrats still don't have a city for their 2016 presidential nominating convention, but they now have dates.
The Democratic National Committee on Friday said their convention would take place the week of July 25, 2016. It comes right after Republicans plan to have their convention in Cleveland the week before.
The earlier-than-normal conventions are designed to allow the parties' next presidential nominees access to more campaign cash and to begin a head-to-head contest looking toward November.
The Democrats are still deciding on a host city and are in final talks with New York, Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio. DNC officials say the choice will come in the next few weeks.
