These 8 Presidents Really Knew How to Drink
Reagan had his jellybeans and Clinton once reveled in cheeseburgers. But what did these leaders drink to get their jollies? You might be surprised by the level of boozing accomplished in the presidential office as early as 1797. Everyone from John Adams to L.B.J. did his share of drinking--but it wasn't always fine Champagne coating those gullets.
Some presidents took beer for breakfast; others enjoyed Scotch from a plastic cup. Some distilled themselves, while others delighted in mass deliveries of liquor to the Oval Office. No matter your politics, you can't deny: These guzzlers-in-chief knew how to handle their drink.
