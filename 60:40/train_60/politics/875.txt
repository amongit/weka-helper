Obama’s Balancing Act on Race Isn’t Working
It's a choice that President Barack Obama never wanted to make: push for racial justice or reduce social tension.
But increasing anger and frustration on all sides are making it more difficult than ever for him to do both.
A flashpoint occurred Saturday when two New York City police officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were killed while they sat in their police car in Brooklyn. The murderer was identified by police as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, an African-American who had made anti-police tirades on social media just before he shot the officers at point-black range.

This came amid heightened sensitivity to racial issues in the aftermath of two incidents in which white police officers killed unarmed black men and grand juries did not indict the officers. Widespread protests against the police and the criminal justice system followed.
On one side, Obama, the first African-American president, is being urged by civil rights activists to do all he can to reduce racial profiling by police that leads to harassment and brutality toward blacks, especially young black men.

Some activists want to continue to organize protests to maintain pressure on those in power.
On the other side, Obama is being urged by police and their supporters to rally behind cops across the country as essential defenders of law and order.
Obama has tried to take a balanced approach. He has spoken in support of law enforcement, but he has also endorsed the view that many blacks are justified in being suspicious of police, and says he wants to take on the issue of racial profiling.
However, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican known for backing tough anti-crime measures, is among those arguing that the president bears much of the responsibility for the current racial climate. Giuliani told Fox News that Obama has raised doubts about the fairness of law officers and has "defamed" the police as racists.
Says Rutgers political scientist Ross Baker: "Upon assuming the presidency, it seemed that no one was better able to deal with racial tension than Barack Obama. His own bi-racialism and commitment to heal the breaches in American life made him a natural for the task."
But Baker told me that Obama has made missteps. One, Baker said, was immediately blaming a white police officer for an incident in 2009 when Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who is black, was arrested by the white officer after Gates forced open a locked door to his own house and was mistaken for an intruder. Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct but the charges were quickly dropped.

Obama also expressed sympathy for a black teen, Trayvon Martin, who was killed in a 2012 altercation with a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. Baker says Obama "appeared to take sides. A white president could have come on the side of Trayvon Martin without the risk of special pleading. On racial matters, he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't."
As I pointed out in my book "Family of Freedom: Presidents and African Americans in the White House," past presidents have been generally reluctant to jump aboard the civil rights movement. Several chief executives said privately that they would have done more but they feared that their overall agendas would be jeopardized by opponents of civil rights if racial issues were pushed too far and if social tensions grew worse.
President John F. Kennedy came late to the civil rights movement but he finally saw it as a moral issue, setting the tone for later progress. In 1963, only a few months before he was assassinated, Kennedy gave an address to the nation in which he declared, "It is as old as the Scriptures and as clear as the Constitution. The heart of the question is whether...we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated."
This is the core principle, the Golden Rule, that animated the racial debate during Kennedy's time and, for a while, during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson. But it is often obscured by today's bitter and emotional arguments over policing, discrimination and the criminal justice system.
