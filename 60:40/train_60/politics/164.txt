Vermont gun legislation to be taken up in Senate
MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - With one major provision dropped and two others trimmed, a hotly debated gun control bill heads to the Vermont Senate this week.
The original legislation included language calling for background checks on all private gun sales, except those between immediately family members. That was strongly opposed by gun-rights groups and is no longer part of the bill.
The legislation still contains provisions calling for reporting to the federal background check registry when someone is adjudicated mentally ill to the extent of being a danger to him- or herself or others.
It also includes provisions allowing state prosecutors to charge someone with a violent felony conviction with being unlawfully in possession of a firearm.
