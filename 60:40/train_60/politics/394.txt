Kejriwal repeats 'bribe' remark despite EC notice, asks voters to accept money from BJP, Congress
New Delhi: Despite being issued notice by the Election Commission, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday repeated the controversial remarks about bribes.
At a rally in Krishnanagar, Kejriwal said he stood by his remarks in which he had asked the voters to accept money from the BJP and the Congress but vote only for AAP.
Kejriwal said, "Opposition would not have been upset with me if I had said that you should vote for those who give you money. Instead, I said take money from them (BJP and Cong) and vote for AAP. So, these parties are upset."
The Election Commission on Tuesday issued notice to Kejriwal for instigating public to take bribes from the BJP and Congress. The notice was sent on a complaint from Congress Legal Department Secretary KC Mittal alleging that Kejriwal was deliberately and intentionally instigating the public.
During a public rally on January 18 at Uttam Nagar, Kejriwal had stirred a controversy by asking voters to take money from both the parties but vote for AAP in the Delhi Assembly elections. "I appeal to the people of Delhi to accept bribes from Congress and BJP. The money they will pay you for votes is money they have stolen from us. Take bribes from the Congress and BJP, but vote for AAP," Kejriwal had said.
