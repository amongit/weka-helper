6 Numbers to Know for Super Bowl Sunday
An estimated 184 million Americans are expected to watch Super Bowl XLIX – or 49, for the non-Roman football fans – on Sunday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation.
Nearly 43 million people plan to host Super Bowl parties across the U.S., and about 13 million people are expected to travel to a local bar or watering hole to catch the game.
While the most important Super Bowl statistics are achieved on the gridiron itself, other figures surrounding the game hold plenty of weight as well. Check out these six primary numbers you need to know going into Super Bowl Sunday.
Consumers are expected to shell out more than $14 billion this year in relation to Super Bowl XLIX, according to the National Retail Federation and Statista. That includes spending on food and drink, decorations, and merchandise and apparel, and is an increase of almost $2 billion from 2014’s $12.37 billion spending benchmark.
The average Super Bowl viewer is expected to spend a record $77.88 in relation to the game. Young adults between 19 and 24 years old are expected to spend an average of $95.92, while the 25- to 34-year-old age bracket will spend $101.54 apiece. Those between the ages of 35 and 44 years old will likely be the biggest spending demographic, with an average spending projection of $102.82.
Consumers aren’t the only ones spending on the Super Bowl. Companies planning to run a 30-second advertisement during the game will have to part with a reported $4.5 million, according to Variety and SuperBowl-Ads.com. That’s up from about $4 million last year and $3.8 million in 2013. And while that may seem like a daunting figure for a 30-second time slot, NBC announced earlier this week that it had sold out all of its scheduled commercial time during the game.
Super Bowl commercials have established a history of pulling out all the stops, and a substantial number of viewers list the ads as a primary reason for tuning into the game. About 47 percent of viewers say the actual football game is the most important part of Super Bowl Sunday, according to the National Retail Federation, while 41.3 percent of those surveyed said commercials and spending time with friends and family are the most important parts of the day.
About 12 percent of those surveyed listed the halftime show as their favorite part of the Super Bowl.
Companies and groups in some areas have the option to purchase airtime in specific markets to run advertisements. The American Petroleum Institute, for example, is expected to spend $100,000 to run a 30-second commercial in the District of Columbia viewing market. The pro-oil trade association has been running a series of advertisements in the Washington area over the last several weeks in support of the Keystone XL pipeline project that's been held up for years, according to the Sunlight Foundation.
There wasn’t a single ticket available for the 2015 Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, for less than $10,000 three days before kickoff, according to Ticketmaster’s NFL Ticket Exchange. The maximum ticket price exceeded $21,000.
Tickets to the very first Super Bowl in 1967, meanwhile, cost between $6 and $12, and there were reportedly 33,000 empty seats.
There have been more than 2,200 points scored in every Super Bowl, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. San Francisco scored a record-high 55 points in its 1990 Super Bowl XXIV victory over the Denver Broncos, while Miami scored a record-low 3 points in its 1972 Super Bowl VI loss to the Dallas Cowboys.
The Pittsburgh Steelers have won a record six Super Bowls and are tied with the Dallas Cowboys for most bowl appearances to date (eight). New England on Sunday will move into second place with seven appearances, tying Denver.
The Buffalo Bills hold records for most consecutive appearances and most consecutive losses in the Super Bowl, losing all four championship games between 1991 and 1994. The Denver Broncos, meanwhile, have lost a record five Super Bowls.
AT&T customers used a reported 624 gigabytes of data during last year’s Super Bowl, which equates to about 1.8 million social media posts with photos. Verizon smartphone users, meanwhile, sucked up about 1,900 GB of data.
The combined 2,524 GB of data used by customers of these two major service providers is equivalent to about 640,000 MP3 downloads, more than 73 million plain-text emails or more than 107 million text messages, according to Comcast gigabyte calculations.
Only three men have attended every Super Bowl game in history. New England Patriots fan Don Crisman, Pittsburgh Steelers fan Tom Henschel and San Francisco 49ers fan Larry Jacobson are the only members of the “Never Miss a Super Bowl Club.”
Robert Cook, a Green Bay Packers fan, was a member of the club until he died in 2011, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. The four were featured in a 2010 Visa commercial.
Combined Super Bowl attendance eclipsed 3.8 million in 2014, according to Sporting Charts. The 1980 Super Bowl saw a record attendance of 103,985 people at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, according to Yahoo Sports.
