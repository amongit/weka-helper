Holiday Windfall: Gasoline Spending Expected to Hit 11-Year Low - US News
Gasoline is giving back some green.
Just in time for the height of the holiday shopping season, the U.S. Energy Information Administration announced Tuesday that average household spending on gasoline next year will drop to its lowest point in 11 years, almost entirely due to plummeting crude oil prices.

Annual household spending on gasoline is expected to average $1,962 in 2015 – a savings of $550 over this year, and if it the prediction proves true, the first time since 2009 that U.S. spending on gasoline will fall below $2,000.
Already, the rise of more fuel-efficient cars and trucks was helping slow consumer spending on gasoline. Cars for model year 2014 were 21 percent more fuel efficient than those for model year 2005, and trucks 19 percent more efficient, the EIA said, citing the Environmental Protection Agency.
The greatest contributor to the big drop in prices, however, is crude oil prices, which account for two-thirds of the price for retail gasoline, the EIA says.

The U.S. shale oil and gas production boom of the past decade – a result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking – has flooded the market with oil. Combined with more fuel-efficient vehicles and a still-sluggish global economy, the average price of Brent crude oil – the benchmark for U.S. gasoline – fell below $59 this week for the first time since May 2009.
EIA warned that its price forecasts are "highly uncertain," but said "gasoline prices are forecast to go even lower in 2015."
In the U.S. on Tuesday, the average price of a gallon of gas was $2.51, according to GasBuddy.com, down from a high of about $3.70 in May.
