Gun rights supporters rally in suburban Philadelphia
BALA CYNWYD, Pa. (AP) - Some gun rights supporters are calling for repeal of a local suburban Philadelphia gun ordinance, saying it conflicts with state law.
The Philadelphia Inquirer (http://bit.ly/1BmxpE6 ) reports that several dozen demonstrators gathered at Bala Cynwyd park in Lower Merion Township on Sunday afternoon.
The rule doesnâ€™t ban guns from parks, but organizers contend that it is vaguely written and could mislead gun owners into thinking that firearms are banned.
Several communities have repealed gun ordinances following passage of a law strengthening state pre-emption of municipal gun ordinances.
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Lancaster all left some ordinances on the books and were sued by the National Rifle Association in January.
Shira Goodman, executive director of the gun control group CeaseFirePA, called the protest a way to intimidate families and bully the township.
