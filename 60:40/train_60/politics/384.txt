Delhi elections: BJP defends ad on Arvind Kejriwal, says AAP twisted meaning of 'gotra'
New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday switched over to defensive mode over objections raised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over an advertisement issued on the latter's chief ministerial candidate Arvind Kejriwal.
Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal, who was fielded by the BJP to respond to AAP's charges, expressed dismay over AAP raising the issue. "It is extremely sad that political parties are twisting the word which was meant to do a political attack. What Kejriwal is doing is violation of Model Code of Conduct to gain political mileage."
Talking to mediapersons, Goyal said the BJP did not believe in dividing India on the basis of caste. "The word ('gotra') has been twisted and misused by AAP," he said.
The Minister said gotra was used metaphorically in a political context but AAP has twisted its meaning.
BJP Delhi president Satish Upadhya, who was also present alongwith Goyal, announced that the party will move the Election Commission and complain against AAP for twisting the meaning of the word 'gotra'.
On the resignation of BJP's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi's election campaign manager, Upadhyay said the party has accepted his resignation. "Differences do occur when we work together. This issue should not be given too much importance," he said.
