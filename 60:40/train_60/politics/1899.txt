Obama Victory Newspaper Covers Mark Win In International Press
"Obama Stays President" "The Divided Country" "Obama Tide"
U.S. President Barack Obama won another term as America's leader on Tuesday, in an election closely monitored around the globe.
Front pages worldwide featured the Democrat's win on Wednesday, and international newspapers put their design skills to work to mark the historic event.
The trends? Plenty of congratulations for the president and his family, and a few surprised reactions to the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Colorado and Washington. The press in a number of countries was left wondering, after a close vote and markedly less enthusiasm for Obama's second term in comparison to 2008, if America has become a divided country?
Take a look at front pages from around the world in the slideshow below. Images collected by the Newseum.
