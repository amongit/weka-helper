Panel: Americans in Sour Mood
Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says, "America is a very, very unhappy country" right now, and there doesn't seem to be much on the horizon to change the sour mood.
Garin added that, despite favorable signs about the macro economy, many Americans don't feel that they have benefited personally and say their incomes have been stagnant; many also say they are living "paycheck to paycheck."

Garin noted that voters decided to "take it out on the president" and voted against fellow Democrats in the midterm election last month. The Democrats came to represent the "status quo" under President Barack Obama and this badly hurt the party's candidates, he said. In the end, Republicans took control of the Senate, added to their House majority and did well in state legislative and gubernatorial races.
Garin made the comments at a Smithsonian-sponsored panel on American politics Wednesday night. I moderated the discussion. Republican pollster Ed Goeas said he is "more and more discouraged" because politicians in Washington get sidetracked and focus on extraneous issues instead of addressing the nation's root problems.
Goeas added that voters have been reacting negatively to the ongoing difficulties in Washington and there has been a "massive shift" in political outlook, with most Americans now agreeing that government is trying to do too much. He said about 40 or 41 percent of voters identify with the Republicans and 43 to 45 percent identify with the Democrats. "The country is very split," Goeas said.

Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for the Washington Post who also participated in the discussion, expressed doubt that Congress and the White House could get much done in the near future. She said there are two scenarios regarding what can be accomplished--"not much" and "nothing at all." Tumulty added: "There is no middle left any more" in Congress.
Asked about the racial turmoil that has followed recent police killings of unarmed black men, Garin said many African Americans feel aggrieved at how they are treated but many whites don't want to talk about race because they think it only makes matters worse. Many Americans hoped that Barack Obama's 2008 election as the first African American president would create a "post-racial" society but "that clearly hasn't happened," Garin said.
