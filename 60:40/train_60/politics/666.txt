Study: Women Still Missing in the Movie Industry
“Selma” director Ava DuVernay may not have won a Golden Globe Sunday night, but for her even to have made it to the director’s chair is an achievement.
In 2014, 93 percent of the 250 top grossing domestic films did not have a female director, according to a new report by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. Women were vastly underrepresented in other positions as well.
Now in its 17th year, the survey – known as “The Celluloid Ceiling“ and led by Martha Lauzen – found that in certain fields, female participation ticked up over last year. However, the number of women in behind-the-scenes roles is still equal to or even worse than female participation in 1998, when the center began tallying such figures.
Among the roles most friendly to women are producer, executive producer and editor; women made up 23 percent, 19 percent and 18 percent of those positions, respectively, in 2014. Women are even more rare in the writer’s room, the director’s chair or operating a camera. Only 11 percent of writers in the 2014 sample were women, as were 7 percent of directors and 5 percent of cinematographers.
