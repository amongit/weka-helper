The Real 'War on Women'
There’s a "war on women" all right, but it’s not what you think it is.
When it first came into fashion, the phrase was Democratic shorthand for policies that ran counter to the interests of what was once commonly referred to as “the fairer sex.” Taken together, the Democrats and their liberal counterparts in the media echo chamber repeated the phrase over and over until it took on the coloration of truth, as often happens when a lie is told frequently.
At base, the theme of the campaign – the rally cry for the war – was that Republicans simply had no respect for women. As evidence were offered the party’s general opposition to legal abortion, its resistance to the proliferation of abortifacients as an over-the-counter method of birth control and Republican refusal to support legislation just because it used the word “women” in the title while enshrining some feminist concept into law.

Admittedly this impression was helped along by the idiotic, over-the-top utterances of a couple of Republicans running for U.S. Senate in 2010 and 2012, which helped reinforce the Democrats’ micro-messaging campaign that led some women to conclude they were going to the polls to defend their access to birth control.
The Republicans failed to understand this – and fail to understand it in the future at their own peril. These charges are not silly or baseless on their face; they resonate, especially with younger women who believe the allegation that the GOP’s mission is to force women back into the stereotypes they see on classic television that pre-date the feminist revolution.
All the noise associated with it is useful because it provides ambient cover for the real war on women, the one being waged by Democrats all across the nation.

It may have started with Sarah Palin, whose vice presidential candidacy was treated as a joke from the moment it was announced. The fact that she is a woman, however, and one who is as far off the feminist reservation as one can be, made her a target even before her poor performance in televised interviews suggested she was not in fact ready for prime time.
Things are a little bit clearer in 2014. In Michigan, Terri Lynn Land, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, is being attacked by Democrats for mentioning that she is a mom in a recent radio interview.
It’s not the first time her Democratic opponent, Rep. Gary Peters, and his allies have raised the issue, implying Land is somehow a traitor to her gender. “It is troubling to see Gary Peters claim over and over that he is an outspoken supporter of women, only to have him remain silent as Terri is attacked,” said Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan in a press call convened to discuss the issue. “Does Gary Peters believe that moms have no business caring about foreign affairs, health care or earning a paycheck?”

The attacks on Land are not an isolated incident. In upstate New York, where former George W. Bush administration appointee Elise Stefanik is running in an open seat against Democrat Aaron Woolf, the real face of sexism on the campaign trail has also shown itself for what it is. In a recent debate as described by the Watertown Daily Times, Woolf said Stefanik had “lived a very white collar life” and raised the question of whether she’d “ever worked manually for a living like I have.” You didn’t hear much about that because it deviates from the accepted narrative that the war on women is being waged by Republicans against Democrats, even though Woolf’s comments show it to, at least, be the other way around.
In Iowa, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, has been criticized for a number of campaign missteps that may cost him the race – one of which is the decision to portray his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst, as a baby chick who never made “a peep” about profligate spending while a member of the state legislature.

“[I]t is hard to imagine that gender played no role in the way Braley’s campaign decided to frame the ad,” wrote Nia-Malika Henderson in the Washington Post. “The Braley campaign has opened itself up to scrutiny and charges of sexism. Surely, they knew some negative press would come of a campaign ad that likens a female Senate candidate to a chick.”
All of these statements, however, are comparatively mild compared to what one Democrat, John Foust, had to say about the woman running against him in the congressional seat just outside Washington. Foust, a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, said at one point that his opponent, Virginia state Del. Barbara Comstock, had never had “a real job.”

Foust’s supporters have been falling all over themselves to put the remark in some kind of context that makes it something less than the crass, inappropriate, blatantly sexist remark that it is. Comstock is an attorney, a former congressional aide and a self-employed businesswoman with a long list of accomplishments. Had their positions been reversed, had a Republican congressional candidate claimed his female Democratic opponent had never had “a real job” when she in fact had a resume with as many credentials as Comstock has, the remark would have rang from coast to coast. The media would have made it as ubiquitous in this cycle as former Rep. Todd Akin’s comment about “legitimate rape” was in the last cycle.
There’s a war on women all right, but it’s not being waged by the GOP; it’s being fought against confident, accomplished and successful Republican women who manage their careers and their families just fine, thank you very much, while refusing to swear allegiance – or perhaps because they refuse to swear allegiance – to the radical feminist mindset that has overtaken the modern Democratic Party. Comstock, Land, Stefanik, Ernst and all the female Republicans running for office like them are standing strong because they are strong. They don’t need insecure men like Foust, Woolf, Braley or Peters putting them down for the choices they’ve made or treating them like second-class citizens because they’re women.
