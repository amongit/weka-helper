Vintage Photos Of The Most Stylish First Ladies (PHOTOS)
We all obsess over Jackie O's iconic pink suit, the one she wore the day President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. And although she was an unforgettable style legend, there hasn't been a First Lady who wasn't fashionable.
In light of Presidents' Day, we're throwin' it back to old school glamour -- pearls, tailored suits and pillbox hats. We also discovered previous FLOTUSes to be trendier than we expected. From Eleanor Roosevelt's flowered headbands to Betty Ford's oversized sunglasses, each First Lady has the perfect combination of style and class.
