No, Justice is Not Colorblind
The recent protests and conversations over #blacklivesmatter show the United States is in no way post-racial. The debate rages on as both sides ask, “Is America’s criminal justice system colorblind?” The best way to know is to look at the data.
First, the U.S. is insanely good at throwing its citizens in the brink. Really, we are. With only 5 percent of the world’s population, we house 25 percent of all prisoners, which makes the country the world’s biggest jailer. The problem has only been getting worse: The prison population has increased by 700 percent since 1970, meaning one in every 31 adults is under some sort of correction, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The U.S.’s love of throwing people behind bars is also expensive – the annual cost per inmate is $21,006 for minimum security and $33,930 for high security, according to the Urban Institute.
The prison population is far from equally distributed. Black residents are imprisoned at a much higher rate than white Americans, which prompted civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander to call the system “The New Jim Crow.” Looking at the numbers, she isn’t far off.
While people of color represent minorities of the country’s overall population, they are a strong majority in U.S. prisons.
Many of the factors contributing to this inequality can be attributed to the system instead of to different behavior between blacks and whites.
Nothing illustrates the difference between justice for the races than the war on drugs. Whites and blacks use drugs at roughly the same rate – there isn’t a statistically significant difference, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Black people, however, are arrested for drug use at a much higher rate. At the disparities’ peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, blacks were five times more likely to be arrested for drugs than whites were.
Recently, we haven’t done much better. The national arrests rates for marijuana possession were 716 arrests per 100,000 black residents in 2010 and 192 arrests per 100,000 white residents. Marijuana arrests accounted for over half of all drug arrests in 2010, according to the ACLU.
Although there isn’t national data on racial profiling by police, looking at city data, it’s pretty clear black citizens have more interactions with police and that those interactions progress further, often without a clear reason.
As we’ve reported previously, in Ferguson, Missouri, blacks are stopped, searched and arrested more than whites, even though whites have a higher contraband hit rate. Even after controlling for population – the community of Ferguson is 60 percent black – black residents are still stopped way more than would be expected, while whites and Hispanics are stopped less than would be expected.
Other cities aren’t any better. In Boston, blacks represent less than 1 in 4 of residents but from 2007 to 2010 accounted for more than 3 of 5 field interrogations, observations, frisks and/or searches. The ACLU found that even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as neighborhood crime rates, past arrest records and alleged gang affiliation, racial differences persisted in encounters with the Boston police. New York’s Stop-and-Frisk policy consistently led to police stopping more blacks and Latinos, even when the area’s population was less than ¼ black and Latino.
Some of those encounters, like the one between unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, end in death. The difference between police killings for white and black teenagers is stark. Black teenage men are 21 times as likely to be the victim of a reported police killing as white teenage men, according to analysis of 2010-2012 data by ProPublica.
The inequalities don’t stop after encounters with police. At every level of the justice system, data show not everyone whose case goes in front of a jury is evaluated equally, not everyone who stands in front of a judge is sentenced equally and not everyone’s case is prosecuted equally.
Killings involving a white perpetrator and a black victim are much more likely to be ruled justified than other killings. Killings with a black perpetrator and a white victim are the least likely to be ruled justified.
The disparities are even greater in states with Stand Your Ground laws, according to the Urban Institute. George Zimmerman used Florida’s Stand Your Ground law as his defense after he shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin.
A study by Duke University researchers looked at data from more than 700 felony trials in two counties in Florida from 2000 to 2010, finding that the racial makeup of the jury and the race of the defendant influenced whether he or she was convicted.
The majority of people serving life sentences at the federal level are black, and almost half of those serving life sentences nationally are black. In some states, the percentage is even higher: In Maryland, 77.4 percent of inmates serving life sentences are black, in Georgia it’s 72 percent and for Mississippi, 71.5 percent, according to research from The Sentencing Project. The ACLU also found authorization to seek the death penalty was more likely when there was at least one white victim in the case. Between December 2007 and September 2011, the sentences for black male offenders are almost 20 percent longer than sentences for white male offenders, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
Deployment of SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams is also correlated with race, according to data from a ACLU investigation that looked at data from 2011 and 2012. Many local police departments have SWAT equipment obtained through the 1033 Program, which sends surplus military gear to local police departments including armored vehicles.
SWAT teams are most often deployed for drug searches, an arrest category that targets people of color. Deployments often happen in the late hours, with police with lights and guns knocking down doors. ACLU data shows police often overestimate the danger of executing search warrants.
Black Americans have a different relationship with police and with the criminal justice system than white Americans do, which influences how blacks think about the system itself. Blacks believe less in the “perceived honesty and ethics” of police officers, according to Gallup polls. Black Americans also have less confidence in the criminal justice system, less confidence in police and are more likely to say the unequal rates of incarceration between blacks and whites are due to racism as opposed to due to something else.
Racial differences between the citizens or defendants and those dispensing justice may also contribute to distrust and unequal punishments. In many U.S. counties, Ferguson included, police officers serving the citizens are mostly white, while residents of the county are mostly people of color, according to The Washington Post.
