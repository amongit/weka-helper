'King Lear's' Modern Message
On the sunlit first day of fall, Washington parted ways with London's Globe Theatre, which brought "King Lear" to the nation's capital for a much-too-short run at the Folger Theatre. After opening in that warm space a couple of weeks ago, the Shakespeare's Globe tour moves on to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which may explain the touch of melancholy in the air. Washington doesn't like to lose to Philadelphia.
In honor of the Bard's 450th birthday this year, the Globe is quite literally spanning the globe in an effort to perform one of his plays in every country. The American tour will take in the coasts and last about three months. The British Ambassador to the U.S., Peter Westmacott, gave the cast a jolly good welcome here.

Swell, isn't it? Now that is what Hillary Clinton would call smart diplomacy and soft power. There's nothing like a Shakespearean play to cast a spell of delight absolutely anywhere. These amazing actors are like ambassadors from Shakespeare himself. Indeed, they rehearse and perform practically on the very ground of the old Globe near the Thames River, where the original plays were performed during his lifetime. (It burned to the ground ages ago, and the glorious new Globe was recently built.)
For a brief follow-up to my previous post on the performance – a wrenching knock-out – I called Paul Smith, director of the British Council USA. I noted before that the Bard's tragedy seemed especially timely, with Lear, the aging king of Britain, going a bit mad and starting armed conflicts leading to war and devastating loss.
There was no way the Globe could have known that President Barack Obama would declare war on Iraq – our third – while the production was in town. He himself didn't even know until late summer. Theatrical timing.

Smith observed that "King Lear" is, of all the tragedies, the one that ties together "internal and civil strife," since Lear is initially enraged by his ("ungrateful") youngest daughter Cordelia and her measured declaration of love when he seeks to divide the realm among his three daughters. Then the family strife tumbles outward to unravel ties that knit the kingdom together. One of the tragic ironies is that Cordelia, of the three sisters, turns out to have the truest love for her father.
Smith, an expert on Shakespeare, added that "King Lear" is the greatest play that stands apart from history or legend. Many of the most famous Elizabethan dramas, like the brooding "Hamlet" and "Julius Caesar," and even the Scottish play "MacBeth," have some basis in known characters and stories. "Lear" is more abstract, apart from passages about Dover. Yet the political intrigue – "Who's in, who's out?" – could be coming from the Capitol a few blocks away.

Speaking only for myself, the removal from specific grounded reality is what makes "King Lear" feel so knowing and relevant to our situation here and now. The entire 21st century has been a time of strife and sorrow. Even the sober Nobel Peace laureate Obama is starting a new desert dervish that could undermine a delicate balance at home – and his own record. If this century were a Broadway show, let's face it, it would be a flop.
The good news: There are more celebratory Shakespeare events to look forward to, Smith said. Coming up is the 400th anniversary of his 1616 death. By 2016, maybe things will be looking up.
