Delhi Assembly elections: Congress releases second list of 25 candidates
New Delhi: Congress on Wednesday released its second list of 25 candidates for the Delhi Assembly elections. The list includes names of Campaign Committee chief Ajay Maken and former MP Mahabal Mishra.
While Maken will contest from Sadar Bazar, Mishra will fight from Dwarka constituency.
Interestingly, the party has decided to field BJP leader Jagdish Mukhi's son-in-law against him. Suresh Kumar will be contesting against Mukhi in the Janakpuri Assembly seat.
The party had announced that it would release names of 45 candidates on Wednesday. However, it finally declared names of only 25 candidates. It has already released names of 24 candidates in the first list earlier this month.
With the release of second list, the party has announced names of 49 candidates out of the total 70 seats in Delhi.
In its first list of 24 candidates, the Congress repeated all its eight MLAs and 12 others who were runner-ups in the 2013 Assembly election in which the party had suffered a setback.
The party is desperately trying to regain the lost ground in Delhi. The last election had brought an end to the 15-year-long rule of the party led by Sheila Dikshit, who herself was defeated by AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal in her home constituency New Delhi.
While it has so far not declared its candidate for the New Delhi seat, sources have maintained that former Chief Minister Dikshit will not be contesting this time and will remain a "key campaigner" for the party.
The new faces in the Congress' first list are ex-Mayor Satbir Singh, who will contest from Mehrauli, and Sachin Bidhuri from Tughlakabad.
Five-time MLA from Matiamahal Shoaib Iqbal, who contested the last Assembly polls on a JD(U) ticket and had joined Congress on November 20, has been fielded from the same seat. PCC Chief Arvinder Singh Lovely, former Minister Harun Yusuf, Devendra Yadav, Jaikishan, Prahlad Singh Sawahney, Asif Mohammed Khan, Mateen Ahmed and Hasan Ahmed, who had won the polls last time, have been repeated.
Lovely will contest from his traditional stronghold Gandhinagar from where he was elected four times while Yusuf, a five-time MLA, will fight from Ballimaran.
Jaikishan will seek a fifth term from Sultanpur Majra while three-time MLA Sawahney will contest from his Chandni Chowk seat. Khan gets renominated from Okhla while Mateen Ahmed will seek re-election for the sixth term from Seelampur. Hasan will fight from Mustafabad.
Former Ministers in Sheila Dikshit's Cabinet Raj Kumar Chauhan and AK Walia, who were defeated in the last Assembly election, have also been given the party nomination from Mangolpuri and Laxminagar respectively.
