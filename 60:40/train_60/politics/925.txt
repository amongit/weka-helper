Heed Netanyahu's Words
When former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Tuesday speech to a joint meeting of Congress an “insult to the intelligence of the United States,” was she speaking only for herself or for her entire caucus?
It’s a fair question, one that every Democrat should be asked and have to answer. Will the members of the party of Truman, who have been living politically off his legacy toward Israel for more than half a century, continue to stand with America's strongest ally in the Middle East or will they turn on her in favor of a weaponized Iran?
“As one who values the U.S.–Israel relationship, and loves Israel,” Pelosi said in a statement released after Netanyahu had finished his remarks, “I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister’s speech – saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation." Only in a Botox-addled brain such as hers could such a statement be considered credible. Everything she and her party have done regarding President Barack Obama’s initiatives toward Iran screams out that they fail to comprehend how dangerous to our security and to Israel’s his efforts are.

Netanyahu’s remarks on the dangers of a nuclear Iran should be heard and heeded by every American, Democrat or Republican. Unfortunately leaders (if she can be called that) like Pelosi who are following in lockstep behind Obama on every issue from A to Z will only hear what they want to hear, rather than the healthy dose of reality the Israeli leader visited upon the members of legislative branch.
There was a time when it would have been unthinkable for an American Democrat in Congress to boycott a speech by an Israeli leader; those days, apparently, are over, with more than 50 Democrats having chosen to boycott the speech. It’s not that all of them are anti-Semites as much as it is they see Netanyahu as Obama’s enemy and will have no truck with him. They have allowed petty partisanship to cloud their minds and their judgment, allowing them to march willing behind the president as he tosses American policy toward Iran out of the frying pan and into the fire.
The president and his national security team are in their sixth year of on the job training and yet still fail to realize that Iran has been fighting a proxy war against the United States for nearly half a century. Obama now seems willing to give Iran everything it wants in exchange for nothing. As described, his latest plan will lead to an Iran in possession of the means to build a nuclear weapon as surely as the sun rises each morning.
Listening to Netanyahu, one could not help but think of another prime minster and a similarly magnificent address to another long-ago joint meeting of Congress. When Winston Churchill first spoke from the same spot back in back in December of 1941, the world was already at war.

What if Churchill, as Netanyahu has done, had been able to deliver his warning about the intent of aggressor nations before the war had begun? What if he had made his impassioned plea for a robust defense of the democracies after Austria was annexed, or after Czechoslovakia was dismembered by world leaders who were fearful of war and believed each of Hitler’s demands was truly his last? It is just possible he could have turned the tide in American politics, crushing the isolationists, thereby allowing America to rearm and prepare for war while there was still enough time for her to become strong enough to prevent it
The Iranians have been clear about their intentions. Why is it that the president, Pelosi and other Democrats are so unwilling to take them at their word? Disregard for the moment the issues of state craft and diplomacy; from a purely political standpoint, it seems the only rational course of action given the way the American Jewish community by and large votes and where its campaign dollars go. One must suppose that their blindness to what is in America’s best interests extends to what is in their party’s best interests as well.
Netanyahu’s speech made clear that Israel has the means to defend itself and, if necessary will do so alone. It shouldn’t have to. America, under the leadership of Obama or any other president, has the sacred obligation to insure that “never again” is something more than a slogan.
