Barack Obama Fundraising For Democrats
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is stepping away from the heated debate over government funding and his health care law to raise campaign cash for Democrats.
Democratic officials say about 25 people are expected at the Jefferson Hotel, a few blocks from the White House. Tickets cost up to $32,400 and benefit the Democratic National Committee, which is still retiring debt from Obama's re-election.
Obama won't make formal remarks and the fundraiser is closed to media coverage.
Obama has been aggressively fundraising for Democratic campaign committees in hopes that Democratic gains in Congress next year may help him achieve his second-term goals. Major legislative efforts on gun control and immigration have stalled following Republican opposition.
Obama has also endorsed Democratic candidates for Senate in New Jersey and mayor in New York City.
