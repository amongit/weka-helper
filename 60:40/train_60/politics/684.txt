Studies Show Voters Can Be Swayed on Gay Marriage, Abortion - US News
Holidays bring family gatherings, snug pants and arguments. If you live in a family with divided political views (and who doesn’t?), you probably know the kind: Sides are taken in an ever-extending battle encompassing logic, data, news coverage, experiences and values – the latter most of all.
Values – cemented from years of life experiences and often intertwined with religion – are nearly impossible to change. And they motivate stances on hot-button issues, particularly same-sex marriage and abortion access.
Yet a new paper published in Science Magazine suggests changing values is not impossible, despite a history of pessimistic literature on the topic. By sending openly gay people door-to-door to talk with people whose values clashed in a fundamental way with their own, the Los Angeles LGBT Center changed minds – and the changes lasted.
The research group, led by UCLA doctoral candidate Michael LaCour, saw similar results on the topic of abortion access. Working with Planned Parenthood, they again simulated a clash of values, sending women who had previously undergone abortions to the doors of people who opposed abortion access. Again, minds and values were changed. Although the results from the second study are still preliminary, so far – six months later – they have held.
So how did it happen?
Exposure has long been known to reduce prejudice. For example, take GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who reversed his opinion on gay marriage after his son came out. But this is something different: Short conversations between two strangers – about 20 minutes – changed minds. Politicians, take note.
Dave Fleischer, director of the center’s advocacy-oriented Leadership LAB, identified the passing of California’s Proposition 8 as the project’s genesis. Prop 8 was a ballot initiative to create a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. It eventually was ruled unconstitutional in federal courts.
"The LGBT community here was incredibly demoralized, furious and unsure about what to do because it was such a shock to lose,” Fleischer says. “Our idea was, 'Why don't we go to the communities who overwhelmingly voted against us and ask the voters why they voted against us?'"
The conversations started. Five years later, the center and its volunteers had 12,000 doorstep conversations in Los Angeles neighborhoods. Because each conversation was videotaped, they were able to learn over time how to talk with voters and incorporated those methods in extensive training given to canvassers – an hour and a half before each day in the field.
The center trains volunteers how to listen and obtain the trust of voters, so they’ll tell volunteers their life experiences around the issue without fearing judgment.
"In order to get a voter to talk to us, they need to feel like they're not going to be judged and they need to feel comfortable opening up and feeling vulnerable with us,” says Laura Gardiner, the national mentoring coordinator for the Leadership LAB. “Us yelling at them or just delivering an argument – however persuasive we might think it is – it’s just not going to be sufficient. That’s what’s so unique about these conversations: It’s a real human interaction."
For years, the group tried to measure the impact of their conversations themselves, but they wanted something more objective. “"There's a reason when you go to Weight Watchers that they weigh you, you don't weigh yourself,” Fleischer says.
To monitor the scales, they sought out UCLA's LaCour and Columbia University political science professor Donald Green, who cautioned results were unlikely to be positive. The pair designed a rigorous study to prove causality, treating it like a medical study with voters randomly assigned to a treatment group, a control group and a placebo group with which canvassers would talk about recycling. Separately, voters completed online surveys that monitored their opinions on a wide range of political issues over the course of a year.
In the study, canvassers performed even better than in the group’s own calculations, and researchers ordered a replication study immediately.
The second study confirmed the results. All three groups – including the control – showed slightly upward shifts in their support of gay marriage, which reflects Gallup polling results nationally. Opinions also may have been boosted by the Supreme Court handing down decisions favorable to gay marriage backers in 2013.
But, when engaged by the group’s LGBT volunteers, voters had a 15-point reduction in prejudice – an amount five times higher than the movement in the placebo and control groups. While the results for LGBT and non-LGBT volunteers were the same initially, the effect decayed for non-LGBT volunteers. When visited by an LGBT volunteer, though, voters' ideas shifted, and the change lasted throughout the year of the study. The changes also spilled over to other members of the household when the volunteer identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
The group wanted to apply the approach to other issues, again putting the object of someone’s prejudice at their doorstep to have a conversation. They teamed with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles for a study on abortion and used the same study design, sending women who had abortions to talk to voters who said they were against abortion access.
Unlike gay marriage, an issue gaining more support in the U.S., national polls on abortion access show an opposite trend. The group worked to change opinions regarding an issue for which support has dropped over the years.
The group’s most recent wave of canvassers increased support for safe and legal abortion by 10 percent. While 39 percent of voters said they agreed with abortion access in initial surveys, after volunteers visited their doors, 49.8 percent agreed. While all volunteers changed minds, women who previously had abortions and chose to tell voters about their experiences achieved the most lasting impact.
Planned Parenthood Los Angeles President and CEO Sue Dunlap watched the first study on Prop 8 with interest, easily seeing the ties to her group's own work, according to a representative from the office.The group thinks the findings can be applied to Ohio and other women's-rights battlegrounds.
In both studies, volunteers were struck with how much voters wanted to talk about the controversial issues. While having someone you don’t agree with and possibly don’t like show up on your doorstep on a weekend is generally an unhappy thought, these voters were happy to have conversations.
Celinda Vazquez – the vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, who went out with canvassers – says minds were changed in eight out of the 10 households she visited.
“I was surprised the average voter wanted to talk about this on a Saturday,” she says.
So as politicians and advocacy groups set their sights on 2016, don’t be surprised to receive a visitor on your stoop, ready to have a heartfelt conversation. Who knows? Maybe you’ll change your mind.
"When was the last time you changed your mind about something important? It doesn’t happen every day,” Fleischer says. "The way people change their mind about something important is when they figure it out for themselves."
