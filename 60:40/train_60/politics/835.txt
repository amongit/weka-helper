Obama Slams GOP on Immigration
President Barack Obama is ratcheting up the pressure on majority Republicans in Congress over the immigration issue, portraying the GOP as behind the times and on the wrong side of history.
Obama urged Republicans to renew financing for the Department of Homeland Security and end their attempt to link that funding with a rollback of Obama's executive actions to limit deportations. The department is in charge of carrying out the president's immigration policies.
"Instead of trying to hold hostage funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which is so important for our national security, fund that and let's get on with actually passing comprehensive immigration reform," Obama said Wednesday at a town hall meeting at Florida International University in Miami.
Obama broadened his pitch in an effort to make the GOP appear out of sync with the times. "Every major social movement, every bit of progress in this country, whether it's been the workers' rights movement or the civil rights movement or the women's rights movement, every single bit of that progress had required us to fight and to push and you make progress," Obama said. "You don't get everything right away, and then push some more."

Obama said it is GOP conservatives, not his fellow Democrats, who have stymied legislation to reform the immigration system.
A federal court in Texas has blocked a key portion of Obama's plan to limit deportations of people who came to the United States illegally as children. White House officials say the administration is seeking a stay of the court ruling.
"At some point there's going to be a President Rodriguez or there's going to be a President Chin," Obama said. "The country is a nation of immigrants and ultimately it will reflect who we are, and its politics will reflect who we are. And that's not something to be afraid of."
