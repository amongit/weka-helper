Obama To Headline First Super PAC Fundraiser
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Barack Obama will headline his first super PAC fundraiser Tuesday in New York.

The White House says Obama will raise money for the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group that takes unlimited donations. Obama's appearance will complete his gradual acceptance of the big-money groups he once opposed.

Obama's transition began when he announced his support for a super PAC backing his 2012 re-election. While he authorized his aides to attend fundraisers for the organization Priorities USA, Obama himself vowed to not directly raise money for the group.

Earlier this year, the White House said Obama would raise money for super PACs backing Democratic House and Senate candidates running in the midterm elections. Tuesday's event will mark the first time he has made good on that pledge.
