Scott Walker Open To Repealing Handgun Waiting Period
WASHINGTON -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) suggested he supports legislation that would eliminate his state's 48 hour waiting period for handgun purchases in an Friday interview with NRA News.
"That's one of those where with new technology, it's real easy to make sure the bad guys donâ€™t get firearms, and the good guys do," Walker said, noting that in 2011 Wisconsin allowed residents to carry concealed weapons.
"I think we're going to be a leader in this area as well," Walker said of the handgun purchase waiting period repeal legislation, which is currently under consideration.
A Walker spokeswoman told the Wisconsin State Journal that the governor favors making it easier for law-abiding citizens to buy guns, but didn't say explicitly whether Walker would sign the bill into law if it is approved by the state legislature.
The Republican sponsor of the bill said in February that the original purpose of the waiting period was to give the FBI time for background checks, which is unnecessary now because that information is digitized. Opponents of the legislation have said the waiting period also serves as a check on impulsive behavior.
