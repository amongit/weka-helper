Accenture partners with high-profile cloud services broker
Mega outsourcing and integration company Accenture — which is one of Amazon Web Services' most elite cloud integration partners — is teaming up with high-profile cloud services broker Liaison Technologies on a big data and analytics solution that will have particular relevance for life sciences companies.
As part of the deal, Accenture is making a minority investment in Liaison, but terms aren't being disclosed.

The idea is to help Accenture's customers better integrate data from across disparate, yet connected cloud services and applications. The platform that it is developing with Liaison could have relevance across consumer goods and retail companies, but the first big test will be in health care.
"We look forward to collaborating with Liaison so we can — through Accenture's Precision Health Intelligence solution — provide a strong data-driven approach to help life sciences companies yield better insights for determining which combination of services and treatments improve patient outcomes as well as the quality and affordability of health care," said Jeff Elton, managing director of Accenture's Life Sciences Precision Health Intelligence, in a statement about the relationship.
Liaison boasts more than 7,000 customers worldwide, and it is one of three Leaders listed on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for this technology category. The company has invested more than $250 million in its cloud integration platform, encompassing six data centers.
