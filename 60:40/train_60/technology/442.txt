Google Code project hosting service shutting down
At tech behemoths like Google (or Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.), projects come and go more often than not.

The latest unit to hit the chopping blog is the Google Code project hosting service.
Google Code was established in 2006 as a collaborative space for developers, hosting open source projects, Wiki pages, and a Subversion/Mercurial/Git repository, among other sharing and management features.
Google's open source director Chris DiBona hinted in a blog post on Thursday that the community saw less traction, pointing toward the growth of similar online open source communities such as GitHub and Bitbucket. DiBona even acknolwedged the the Google Code team even migrated nearly a thousand of its own open source projects to GitHub.
Google Code previously closed in on itself, to a certain extent, in 2013 when it nixed downloads due to a "significant increase" in inappropriate incidents and "misuse." Developers were redirected to Google Drive instead.
Apparently the problems continued, as DiBona highlighted "a growing share of the remaining projects were spam or abuse" as developers migrated away from Google Code.
"Lately, the administrative load has consisted almost exclusively of abuse management," lamented DiBona. "After profiling non-abusive activity on Google Code, it has become clear to us that the service simply isn't needed anymore."
Encouraging users to migrate Google Code projects to GitHub via an exporter tool, Google promised it will continue to provide Git and Gerrit hosting for certain projects related to Android and Chrome as well as maintain mirrors of projects like Eclipse, kernel.org and others.
All new project creation options on Google Code have already been disabled, and the service will become read-only on August 24.
Google Code will shutter entirely on January 25th, 2016.
