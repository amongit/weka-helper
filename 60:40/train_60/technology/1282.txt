MWC 2015: Cyanogen announces Qualcomm partnership and company rebranding
You may be familiar with Cyanogen as the operating system on the current OnePlus One and available for other Android phones in the form of CM ROMs. Cyanogen made two announcements at MWC in Spain today, related to further expansion of its mobile operating system.
Cyanogen Inc. announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Cyanogen will provide its Cyanogen Operating System for future Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) devices running Qualcomm 200, 400, and 600 series processors.
The press release states that the QRD program is designed to streamline the rapid introduction of devices at lower development costs. Cyanogen's new Launcher will be provided to these low to mid level devices, along with the other beneficial features of Cyanogen OS.
Cyanogen will be launching its new website at www.cyngn.com that includes its new brand identity and associated logo.
Cyanogen's new brand identity consists of a focus on an open Android platform/ecosystem to drive innovation, and benefit consumers, developers, and hardware makers.
