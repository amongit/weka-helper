Dimension Data's latest private cloud service builds on Microsoft platform
Dimension Data is adding to its private cloud infrastructure services with a new offering that builds on the Microsoft Cloud Platform. The service builds on Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V, System Center 2012 R2 and Windows Azure Pack.
Even though the $6 billion integrator already has its own private cloud service, called Private Compute-as-a-Service (CaaS), the new offering is meant for businesses and organizations that are seeking to move Microsoft workloads between on-premise, Microsoft Azure and Dimension Data cloud environments. Microsoft is a Microsoft Certified Gold Partner and a Microsoft Cloud OS Network partner.
The new service can support 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux environments for mission-critical business and Web applications, software development and testing scenarios, and virtual desktop services.
It's just another example of Dimension Data's quest to support its clients with cloud services in pretty much whatever form they need or want.
Dimension Data's cloud services presence is extensive: the company will deliver its new service either within client data centers or in any of this 10 Managed Cloud Platform locations, including Santa Clara, Calif., Ashburn, Va., Amsterdam, London, Sydney, Melbourne, Tokyo, Hong Kong or Johannesburg.
