Facebook Brazil head steps down
Facebook Brazil's main executive Alexandre Hohagen has announced he will step down from his role to "pursue other dreams."
After building the local presence of the company from scratch out of his SÃ£o Paulo living room, Hohagen leaves the company after four years of service. Facebook Brazil's top man will help the company recruit a replacement and will remain until the transition is complete.
The executive mentioned on a post in the social networking website that he has "always been attracted by risky and bold career moves and leaving Facebook is no different," but having built the team and the business foundations for the company in Brazil will make his departure easier.
"I loved building Facebook's [presence] in Latin America, however, now its time to pursue other dreams. I want to dedicate more time to my family and also use my experience and knowledge to help young Latin American entrepreneurs and non-profit organizations in the region," Hohagen added.
Prior to joining Facebook as a Vice President of Sales for Latin America, Hohagen was the vice-president for the region at Google, where he worked for five years.
