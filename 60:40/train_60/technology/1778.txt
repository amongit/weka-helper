​Confidence in Oracle's Q2 wanes | ZDNet
Oracle reports its second quarter earnings on Wednesday and expectations are low given the company recent financial performance.The Future of IT: A Strategic GuideZDNet and TechRepublic draw on their community of C-level executives and business thinkers to prognosticate where business technology is headed over the next 36 months. This includes advice, perspectives, and opinions on both creating and reacting to the future.This quarter appears to have been hit by currency fluctuations, the timing of Thanksgiving, weak hardware sales (again) and a cloud strategy that is simply too busy, say analysts. Patrick Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in a research report that only two of his checks ahead of the results were positive. Fourteen were negative. Meanwhile, Oracle's cloud business only represents about 6 percent of total revenue and the strategy is fuzzy. Oracle's approach has been to launch a non-stop barrage of services, but that move makes for a more complicated narrative. Walravens said:Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig wasn't exactly enthusiastic. He said:Koenig noted that the hardware business is likely to disappoint and there may be some cloud organic growth. Overall, Oracle is likely to cut its outlook for the third quarter simply based on currency. Stifel analyst Brad Reback noted that Oracle could hit its quarter, but it's unlikely that the company can deliver meaningful gains relative to estimates because of the transition to the cloud. License growth will suffer, but the focus on the cloud is "a healthy long-term move."
