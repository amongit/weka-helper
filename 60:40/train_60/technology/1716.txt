​OnePlus One arrives in 16 new European countries | ZDNet
OnePlus has announced its popular One phone will be available across the entire European Union, arriving in 16 new countries. With just a single handset released so far, the Chinese handset maker has managed to grab more than its fair share of attention through the One's affordable $350 price tag coupled with high-end specs and its different take on Android. Ahead of its third quarter 2015 launch of the successor to the One, OnePlus is expanding sales of the device to a number of new countries, mostly in central and eastern Europe. The handset originally launched in 17 countries in 2014 across North America, Western Europe and Asia. More recently, it launched the handset in India and Indonesia.OnePlus: What's next for the company that made this year's most interesting Android phone? The new EU markets include Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The good news for would-be buyers in the 16 countries is that they won't need to suffer the frustration of using the original invite system to buy the One, which left many users frustrated. OnePlus last month announced a secondary system to make it easier for those without the right contacts to buy a device, allowing anyone to register to buy the device a 24 hour window every Tuesday. That system will be available to buyers in the new markets too, OnePlus confirmed. As elsewhere in Europe, the 16GB One is available for €269 while the 64GB One is available for €299. The EU expansion comes on the heels of a busy year in which the company has expanded from 30 employees to almost 700. OnePlus has also been developing its own OxygenOS, which OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei on the company's tour of Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest this week. The company opted to develop its own OS after its deal to ship the One to India with Cyanogen came apart due to an exclusive arrangement Cyanogen Inc had struck with Indian smartphone maker Micromax. OnePlus was forced to stop shipping the One with Cyanogen in India but still its version of Cyanogen to other markets. While the tie-up remains intact, OnePlus is developing the OS to give it more control over the destiny of software on its devices. Read more on OnePlus
