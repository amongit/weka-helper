Customer focus to drive India tech market in 2014
India has faced quite a difficult year with various factors such as policy reforms, fluctuating rupee value against major currencies and political uncertainty stirring up headwinds.
Going into 2014, Forrester's Asia Pacific (AP) analyst team has just published its technology predictions for next year. What top trends will be critical to the Indian market?
There are some interesting insights that come out of this article by Sudhanshu Bhandari and Manish Bahl on the Forrester blog that are based on the research they published.
Taking a look at these predictions, my take is that they are certainly some attributes that are always there for the talking and this research proves a point or two. As rightly highlighted no matter how well the CIOs used to be able to focus narrowly on internally oriented back-end IT, come 2014, times they are a changing. As rightly mentioned the growing power of the customer and business leaders' increasing involvement in tech investments has changed a lot of aspects. And specifically if your focus is on the customer, your IT systems and resources should be well directed towards empowerment of your customers. What do you think?
