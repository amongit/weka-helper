The iPod Classic: Thanks and goodbye
I've written about Apple's habit of retiring gadgets while I'm still cheerfully using them before, and the iPod Classic is the latest to get discontinued, seven years after it was first launched.
It took me long enough to get over my original iPad reaching the end of the line, stranded forever at iOS 5.1.1. Oh yes, I still have the iPad in question and despite the fact that the software is all out of date it still works just fine.
For Apple, of course, that is the point. How is poor old Apple supposed to cope if its kit last forever and we stop buying a new one every 18 months?
So, the iPod Classic is old hat and is going to the great scrap heap in the sky — and this is one of a number of things about Apple's decision that has raised my temperature.
First of all, I did not find out that the iPod Classic had been phased out from anybody in particular but through omission. The iPod Classic is no longer on the iPod website.
Secondly, nothing else like it exists. The iPod Classic had 160GB of disk space. Its nearest equivalent from Apple, the iPod Touch, has a maximum space of 64GB. The regular iPod just 16GB. You can spot the difference, can't you? Memory size.
My Classic easily accommodates my wife's and my entire music collections — all 110GB of them. The maximum memory size of current Apple products does not get close.
So why has Apple done this? Well, firstly you may point out that I don't need that much local storage space any more, or that I should be storing it all in the cloud. But I would have to disagree.
It is true that I have other devices that I can use to store music, such as my a regular iPad or iPhone. Yes, they have plenty of space for music but not like my Classic.
With the Classic hooked up to my Bose stereo, I can listen to any music from my collection anywhere in the world at any time. For me, with this decision a company that has so often been at the forefront of innovation has taken a step backwards.
