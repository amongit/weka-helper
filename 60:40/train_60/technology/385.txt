Microsoft Garage incubator delivers new Windows Phone, Android productivity apps
In October 2014, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Garage was morphing from an internal hacking lab to an incubator for lightweight, consumer-focused apps for Android, iOS and Windows devices.
On February 25, Microsoft made available a handful of new experimental Garage apps, several of which are more business-centric and productivity-focused.
Among the new, free Garage apps, ready for testers to download:
Microsoft also updated the previously released Torque app (now version 2.5), which extends the Bing Search Assistant for Android from the Android Wear watch to the phone.

Are Android smartphones finally poised to conquer the enterprise?
Android has long ruled the consumer smartphone market â€“ but can it make an impact on the business market too?
But now The Garage's new mission is to bring these kinds of side-project apps, as well as apps from other parts of the company, including Microsoft Research, available externally through the revamped Garage portal.
The Garage apps are cross-platform, available in the Apple App Store, Google Play and/or Windows Store, where applicable. The Garage apps are all in the "experimental" phase, and are updated and improved based on user experience and feedback.
