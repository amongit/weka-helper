Will the Singapore Do Not Call Registry lead to more e-mail marketing?
The implementation of the Do Not Call (DNC) Registry in Singapore does not directly affect business-to-business marketing, but will the restrictions on digital marketing to numeric phone number recipients indirectly divert (or revert) interest to more marketing to non-numeric e-mail address recipients? If so, other than the obvious Personal Data Protection Act compliance consultancy, there may be business opportunities coming up.
Most people are not interested in what happens to their trash and junk. Likewise, I never paid attention to junk emails. At best, I might decide that the spam filter that came with my email service provider is good or lousy.
It was not until I was told about SendForensics did I realize there is science behind junking emails. And with SendForensics, it is some serious science. It bothered to analyze why mass emails often fail to reach a significant number of its recipients. Better yet, it figured out what and how you as a business can fix your mass e-mail message to reach more recipients. And it can quantify the effectiveness of what it does.
I am reminded that innovations need not be glamorous or fun. If you can find problems a few people want to solve, you can become the expert in that area.
I am not encouraging anyone to go into more e-mail marketing, or more junk, as many self-described quantitative information consumers would call it. I certainly would want to know more if laptop batteries could recharge by themselves, tablet screens could be large, yet lighter than 100g, or smartphones could survive all falls. Just do not spam me when I have 100 urgent work e-mails to take action on and 1,000 fun social media messages to enjoy.
I have not studied much about digital marketing to be able to comment much. What is your take?
