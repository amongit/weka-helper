The defeat on Friday evening followed a 13-8 loss to world champions Hungary earlier in the day at the Dublin Cup warm-up tournament in Ireland.
Britain are fielding a men's Olympic polo team for the first time since the 1956 Games and they are testing themselves against some of the world's best in Ireland to prepare for London 2012.
The match against Montenegro got off to a dramatic start with Team GB goalkeeper Ed Scott saving a penalty before captain Craig Figes scored at the other end within the opening minute.
Montenegro quickly hit back though and, despite Adam Scholefield adding a second for GB, the European Championship runners-up had a 4-2 lead by the end of the first quarter.
The lead had extended to 8-4 at the half-time break and GB were unable to make inroads as their opposition scored exactly four goals in each quarter.

Earlier in the day, GB had taken on a Hungarian side aiming for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal.
Figes scored a penalty after just 25 seconds to give his side a shock lead and the score was level after the first quarter but the Hungarians soon moved ahead and cruised to victory despite a hat-trick from Britain's Jack Waller.
"It was a tough day against two of the best teams in the world," Scholefield told BBC Sport.
"We worked really hard against Hungary but two games in a single day is a lot to cope with.
"We're in a really difficult group at the Olympics so things won't get any easier but we are making progress every match."
Great Britain's group at the London Games has been named the 'group of death' with matches against the reigning gold, silver and bronze medallists, Hungary, the United States and Serbia, as well as Montenegro and Romania.
The Team GB players, who all play for different club sides around Europe, have two more warm-up matches in the Dublin Cup against Croatia and Romania.
