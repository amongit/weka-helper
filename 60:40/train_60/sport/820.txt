Scotland v Ireland: We will not be complacent, insists Paul O'Connell, ahead of Six Nations clash at Murrayfield

It ought to be easy for Ireland. They come as reigning champions, they are ranked third in the world, they have won 10 of their last 11 games and they are up against a Scotland side who have yet to get off the mark in this year’s Six Nations. What could they possibly have to fear?
On paper, nothing. Yet Paul O’Connell has been round the Test rugby block often enough to know that these Celtic cousins have a habit of levelling the playing field. His mind goes back to 2010, Ireland’s last game at Croke Park, when a bucket of whitewash dangled over the Scots and Ireland were on the cusp of a Triple Crown. And he remembers how Dan Parks’ towering last-minute penalty gave Scotland a 23-20 win.
Which is why he is wary of the cornered animal that Ireland will face at Murrayfield in the last-but-one contest of this year’s championship. The Scots have played magnificently at times, their young backs have put together some electrifying plays, but they have yet to register a win. O’Connell can almost smell their desperation.

Another flashback. To 2011 this time. Ireland had already lost to France and Wales and they were supposed to be bystanders when England, seemingly careering towards the Grand Slam, arrived in Dublin on the championship’s last day. O’Connell remembers the determination of his fellow players, but also the fact that the pressure was not on them.
“England coming over to try and pick up a trophy in the Aviva Stadium was incredibly motivating for us,” the Ireland captain recalled. “With the combination of those factors, everything clicked, and we produced a fantastic performance. That is the threat.
“I am definitely concerned [about Scotland]. It is not a nice place to be, but sometimes having nothing to lose, and playing at home against a team that has something to win, is a great position to be in. It is an empowering position. I have been there with Ireland before.”

O’Connell is coy on the question of whether Murrayfield will be his Six Nations swansong. You would never expect anything less from a man who is a giant of the modern game as an individual, but also epitomises rugby’s collective ethos. Now in his 14th year as an international player, his outlook has never wavered. Hence his refusal to be bogged down by the details of Ireland’s loss to Wales in Cardiff last weekend.
Their shortcomings – in the line-out, under the high ball, in turning pressure into points – were clear for all to see, but his focus has been on the fix, not the fault.
“We put ourselves under a bit of pressure, a lot of pressure,” he said of that 23-16, Grand Slam-derailing defeat at the Millennium Stadium. “It was a combination of things, and that’s something we historically haven’t done.
• Our experts predict the Six Nations winners • England must lay down a World Cup marker • We rank the World Cup's 20 nations with six months to go
“We have made mistakes but we usually don’t back them up with more errors. That’s something we need to improve; if we do make a mistake then we mustn’t follow it up with another one.”
In a sense, Ireland have the hardest task of all the pretenders to the Six Nations crown on the tournament’s Super Saturday. Even if Wales keep their score against Italy somewhere below the stratosphere, the consensus view is that Ireland will probably have to win by a double-figure margin to put pressure on England. This with a side who have struggled to score tries this year. This against a team who have an agenda of their own.
O’Connell is not inclined to dismiss that factor. Nor to believe that Scotland’s bottom slot in the Six Nations table is a true measure of the abilities or the self-belief of their players.

Does he worry that they might be more confident against Irish players they meet – and beat – regularly in the Guinness Pro12? “Familiarity probably allows that,” O’Connell acknowledged. “In recent years, Glasgow have been incredibly confident and they have played a great brand of rugby. All the provinces have found them really hard to live with at times. And there is a big spine of Glasgow players in the Scotland team.”
And what of the Clermont Auvergne factor? Scotland coach Vern Cotter and Ireland coach Joe Schmidt worked together at the French club, turning the perennial also-rans into champions. There are rumours the pair will reunite someday to take charge of their native New Zealand, but on Saturday they will be staring at each other across the Murrayfield chess board. It might come down to who blinks first.
