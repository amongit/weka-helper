Cammas' Volvo Ocean Race victory – Groupama finished second on leg nine to confirm overall victory – gave France only their second win in the 39-year history of the offshore race following Pean's triumph on board L'Esprit d'Equipe in the 1985/86 edition.
And Péan led the praise for Cammas, 39, with an open letter to Cammas toasting his crew’s win on their debut in the race, and succeeding Brazilian Torben Grael, who won in 2008/09 with the Swedish yacht Ericsson.
“It is a huge joy to congratulate you on your amazing victory, which was humility, discipline and strength,” Péan wrote.
“I congratulate also all the team you have chosen to surround you. Their individual qualities, their work, their motivation under your leadership have build this huge victory.
“With this victory in the Volvo Ocean Race you show again to the world that the art of sailing in our beautiful country is, and stays, exclusively at the highest level of excellence.

“Hats off from all the L'Esprit d'Equipe crew.”
New Zealand yacht Camper won the ninth and final leg of the eight month race in the early hours of Tuesday.
Camper, skippered by Australian Chris Nicholson, crossed the finishing line seven minutes ahead of Groupama as they recorded their first win since the race began in Alicante. Naturally, the team celebrated in style in front of thousands in the port of Galway.
"This place is awesome," said Nicholson. "It’s 2.30 in the morning and there’s a massive fleet of spectator boats. How cool?
“I’m more happy for the rest of the team to be honest with you. I look at what everyone does day in day out and I think this is the sailing team’s way of saying thank you."
