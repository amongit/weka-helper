The Mirror broke the news that London-based McCartney, 42, will be collaborating again with Adidas, the sportswear brand she has created performance collections with since 2001. For 2012, she catered for 900 British Olympic and Paralympic athletes competing in 46 sports, resulting in 590 different items of clothing, all created to maximise the athletes' efficiency in their various disciplines.
The project took two years of development and the kits featured Union Jacks but without the red, which was used as an accent around necklines, cuffs and shoes. Members of the public were available to buy basic bits from the collection.
