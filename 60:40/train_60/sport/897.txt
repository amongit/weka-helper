Lewis Hamilton has admitted that he would have voted for Rory McIlroy to be the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year. Rarely has there been such fallout following the award’s announcement than that which greeted the Formula One champion’s shock win ahead of the world's No 1 golfer on Sunday night.
The world of golf reacted with dismay at Hamilton’s landslide victory at the expense of its biggest star after a public phone-in which confounded viewers, bookmakers and the victor himself.
Asked how he would have cast his vote had he been watching at home, Hamilton said: “Rory.” The F1 ­champion added: “Apart from on my 21st birthday, when my dad staged a surprise party, I don’t think I’ve ever been so surprised.”
Hamilton attempted to explain the outcome by arguing that viewers could have difficulty choosing a ­winner “because everyone in their own right has achieved so much”.
Maybe so, but there was a sense that, of the 10 contenders, only ­McIlroy had produced something truly historic in 2014: the first Briton to win back-to-back majors – and inside 21 days; the first European in the modern era to have completed three legs of the career grand slam; the third-youngest golfer to win four major titles; an indispensable cog in Europe’s Ryder Cup triumph.

McIlroy performed feats to rival those of any of the BBC award’s ­previous winners, making the ­entreaties of his fellow professionals understand­able: what more could he have done to deserve the prestigious prize?
His “very disappointed” Ryder Cup captain, Paul McGinley, said: “I don’t think that a golfer can have a better year than Rory did. Lewis Hamilton had a good year, too, but it would be difficult for any golfer to do better than Rory did this year.
“He’s a great guy who takes his responsibilities as the world’s No 1 player very seriously. We are lucky to have him. I don’t know why he didn’t win. I don’t know what the issues are but I don’t want to take away from Lewis Hamilton.”
Typically, McIlroy’s Ryder Cup team-mate Ian Poulter was not slow to make his feelings known on social media, branding as “ridiculous” an the outcome that had rendered the award a “complete joke”, as well as pointing out that Hamilton’s only serious challenge this year came from his own Mercedes team-mate.
There was more F1-bashing from Lee Westwood, the European team veteran, who tweeted: “Technology of the year goes to the silver and red dodgem!!! Just have to win all 4 next year @McIlroyRory!”

Obsolutely ridiculous that @McIlroyRory has not won Sports Personality 2014. Huge respect to @LewisHamilton but come on.

.@BBCSPOTY has turned into a complete joke. It's such a great shame. Huge congrats to @LewisHamilton, but he had 1 person to beat all year.
ir Nick Faldo, the last golfer to win the BBC award in 1989, retweeted a post from the television presenters Ant and Dec which read: “Rory ­obviously needs faster clubs.”
Luke Donald, Britain’s last world No 1 before McIlroy and a former Ryder Cup team-mate, posted: “Lot of angry people on my timeline... Unfortunately as long as SPOTY ­continues to be a public vote then this will continue to happen!”
The problem is that there is no fairer way – at least not that has yet been devised – to determine the ­winner in what is partly an award for achievement and partly a popularity contest. The indisputable fact is that more people – tens of thousands more as it turned out – picked up the phone to vote for Hamilton than McIlroy. That would have been unthinkable even a couple of years ago, when the 29-year-old had as big an army of critics as fans

Rory obviously needs faster clubs. D #SPOTY
Having made history himself in becoming the youngest F1 world champion, in 2008, Hamilton was one of the ­darlings of the sporting nation. But public opinion was already beginning to turn against him after he moved away from Britain for the tax haven of Switzerland.
His pop-star lifestyle, on-off relationship with his girlfriend, ill-advised paraphrasing of an Ali G catchphrase and his decision to abandon the team which groomed him, hardly portrayed him in the best light. But his return to the top of the podium has coincided with a more mature outlook.
“Watching the TV, it’s not always easy to get an understanding of who someone is,” he said. “And it’s not until I meet them that things change, and that’s probably the same for ­everyone. I didn’t know how popular I was here – I just know that people know that I do raise a flag proudly. I don’t know how many people called in, but I’m just overwhelmed.”
More than 200,000 picked up the phone from an audience of six million, up on the 5.7 million which watched Andy Murray claim the prize – albeit with double the vote.
Hamilton said: “I have an amazing, amazing following. I’m not saying a large following but, people that do ­follow me, I’m touched every day by the messages that they’ve sent, when I arrive at races, when people have gone out and got the cap or they’ve made something for you, they give you presents or they give you letters or they fly across the world and they stand in the rain.
“Whatever it may be, I’m so moved every time I see those people.”
Hamilton, who jetted back to America after the awards for a ­skiing holiday, also revealed that he plans seven more years in F1. “Honestly, you can’t understand what I’m ­feeling. It’s an incredible, great feeling.”
