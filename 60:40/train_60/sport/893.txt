World Snooker Champion Mark Selby heads to Blackpool this week for the one-frame fun of the Snooker Shootout – but warns that reputations will count for nothing.
For the uninitiated, the 64-competitor event is contested without seeding in a random draw, and each match is just one frame. It has been compared to cricket's Twenty20 format.
There’s a shot clock that’s reduced to ten seconds per shot as the frame goes on, and if a frame runs over ten minutes, the player who is ahead wins.
It’s part of Barry Hearn’s ongoing battle to return snooker to something like the glory days and, while it might not be to the taste of the purists, the current world champion and world number one, Selby, is a fan.
“It’s a bit of fun, not to be taken too seriously,” he told Telegraph Sport. “It’s impossible to predict a winner because anyone can beat anyone. The crowd get involved, there’s plenty of banter and a lot of noise.
“I’m from a pool background so I like that side of it, the noise and the crowd. Snooker, well, that’s more of a gentleman’s game!”
There’s no doubt that Selby is a gentleman on the table and off it, and fans of the popular Leicester player will find plenty to like in Friday’s documentary profile of him on Sky Sports Five.
In it he talks about his father, who died when the snooker champ was 16, and a tough upbringing that made him the determined player he is today.
There’s not too much grim determination on show in the Snooker Shootout, but Selby is nevertheless hoping for a better showing than his 2013 efforts.
“I was playing Ronnie O'Sullivan. I broke off, he potted a red, made a century, that was that. Someone shouted “taxi for Selby!” said Selby.
But not every game at the Snooker Shootout promises Rocket-style high-octane shot-making, Selby warned.
“Steve Davis played Peter Ebdon in it a couple of years ago,” he said. “As they started, someone in the crowd shouted ‘this one’s got nil-nil written all over it’.”
You don’t get that at The Crucible...
Sky Sports 5 will show Mark Selby: the Life of a World Champion at 9pm on Friday 6 March or catch up on demand. Coverage of the Snooker Shootout begins Wednesday 4 March at 6pm on Sky Sports 3
