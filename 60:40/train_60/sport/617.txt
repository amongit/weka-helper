If you’ve ever ridden behind a good road cyclist, you’ll understand the importance of technique.
The pedalling, gearing and braking are all so smooth and fluid as to be imperceptible. The hips are still, the cadence steady as a heartbeat. They are one with the bike. No piece of expensive kit is going to get you to that place. The only thing you can do is observe how others do it and practice, practice, practice.
Technique is often a factor of fitness. Climbing technique, for example, is pretty much a direct function of how fit you are, and how steady you can keep your cadence on the ascent. Descending, on the other hand, is all about bike-handling, and requires quite complex techniques in order to master it to its best (and most enjoyable) effect. Pedalling, gearing and braking require a combination of experience and common sense.
Watch the pros in their races, and listen to the more experienced members of your group. The more you embed the movement patterns of good technique into your neuromuscular pathways, the closer you’re going to get to that effortless glide.

1. PEDALLING
Pedalling technique is a much debated issue, with many cycling gurus advocating the concept of ‘using the whole of the pedal stroke’ by pulling on the upwards stroke as well as pushing on the downwards. I’m not a great believer in this philosophy. The best literature on this, in my opinion, comes from Dr Jeff Broker, who has dedicated over a decade of research to the art of pedalling.
According to Dr Broker, pulling up on the pedal does not increase maximal power output, and in fact it can cause injury. Pulling the pedal up puts a lot of pressure on the hamstrings and the hip flexors. These muscles are designed to lift the weight of the leg against gravity whilst running or walking and struggle to cope with the demand of contracting repeatedly against the resistance of the pedal. As the muscle fatigues, this increases tightness, which can contribute to lower back and hip pain. In addition to this, at recommended cadences of 80-90rpm, the muscular system cannot contract and relax quick enough to deactivate one group of muscles and contract another. In other words, as the left leg pushes down, the right leg cannot get out of the way quick enough to create negative pressure on the pedal, let alone generate force in an upwards direction.
In short, pulling on the upstroke does not work. So what is the correct pedal technique? Dr Broker advocates directing all your power into the downward stroke, starting the stroke at 12 o’clock, and ending it at 6 o’clock. This is termed the ‘drive phase’. As the drive phase is coming to an end on one leg, it should be beginning on the other leg, while the first leg relaxes. Peak torque during the drive phase should occur around the 3 o’clock position.

Some pedalling exercises:
• If you are used to ‘push/pull’ pedalling, retrain your muscles to switch off on the upstroke by replacing your clipless pedals with flat pedals and doing some sessions with your bike on the turbo trainer.
• Note your average cadence on a normal, steady-state turbo session. Next time, try to increase it by 10rpm.
• This one-hour training session will focus your attention on pedalling: Warm up for 10 minutes. Every five minutes after that, shift your gears to the small ring and a big sprocket, and sprint as fast as you can for 10 seconds. Do this for 40 minutes, and then cool down for 10.
• 30-30s: Ride for 30 seconds at a super high cadence in a low gear, followed by 30 seconds of easy pedalling. Repeat this 10 times and do four sets, recovering for 10 minutes between sets.
• Muscle tension intervals: Pedal at 50-60rpm in a gear that keeps your heart rate below zone 3. Focus on pushing down on the pedals, concentrating on the contractions of your gluteals, hamstrings and calves. Do this for 10-minute blocks, making sure your posture is correct and that your heel does not drop down.

2. GEARING
A common mistake of new cyclists is inefficient use of their gears. When moving from one gradient to another, it’s crucial to shift gears swiftly so as not to lose momentum and precious energy. A good way of thinking about gears is that they are the means of keeping your cadence (pedalling rate) steady at 80-90rpm over a long period of time and a variety of gradients.
Too high a cadence will lessen force and elevate heart rate, whilst laborious, lower pedal frequency will increase power per revolution and burn through fuel stores more swiftly. Switching gears nice and early will keep your pedalling more consistent, making your ride smooth and fluid.
Most bike set ups these days come equipped with what is known as a compact chain set as standard: A 50-tooth outer front chainring and a 32-tooth inner front chainring coupled with a rear cassette ranging from 11 up to 32 tooth sprockets in varying ranges (12/23, 12/27, 11/28 etc). Try to avoid using the opposing extremes on your chain and cassette. You don’t want to be in the big chainring on the front and the big sprocket on the back or the small chainring on the front and small sprocket at the back. This will result in a less than optimal chain line that will increase stress and rate of wear on your chain, front chainrings and rear cassette.
Most chain drops result from changing up and down from the small chainring to the large chainring on the front whilst under continued load.
It’s best to ease off pressure for a split second to allow for the change to occur more freely, similarly to the way you engage the clutch in a car before changing gears. Start by moving the chain towards the centre of the rear cassette a couple of clicks, and then move the front chainrings up or down.
This will lessen the chance of dropping or jamming the chain.
The key to efficient gear use is anticipation. If you know what’s ahead, whether it’s a climb, a descent, a wet surface or an obstacle, you can have your gearing prepared. If you’re on a descent you can see a climb approaching, for example, change down on the rear cassette so that the chain is towards the middle of the block as you approach the climb. Then, as soon as you hit the climb you can change down easily on the front chainring. If you change under load (ie. once the gradient has increased) you will have lost all your momentum, forcing you to work harder as you crunch through the gears.


3. DESCENDING
One of the best pieces of advice I was given when I started out, was not to be scared to get on the drops when going downhill. Basically, the lower your centre of gravity is, the more control you have over the bike (and the faster you go). Like anything else on the bike, this is a skill that needs to be learned and practiced, with confidence being a massive factor. I have ridden with people who effortlessly drop like a stone down the mountain, the gap between me and them growing with every corner. I am by no means a great descender, however, it is a magical sensation when you are racing downhill, getting the right line into the corners to make your descent smooth and fluid.
It’s helpful to distinguish between straight line descending and the more complex art of cornering when discussing descent techniques:
Straight Line Descending
• Get on the drops. This lowers your centre of gravity, gives you greater control and also makes you more aerodynamic.
• Always look ahead. This sounds obvious, but things come up a lot quicker when descending, so stay alert.
• Keep a relaxed grip on the bars. Tensing up will make your bike handling less efficient. Remember to breathe, drop your shoulders, bend your elbows and try to keep it loose.
• Sit slightly off the saddle. This will give you a natural form of suspension, allowing you to respond to undulations in the road without bouncing around.
• Keep your legs turning over if you can. As well as keeping you fluid with the bike, this will stop your heart rate from coming down too much, and will also keep your legs warm.
• It is important to keep your upper body warm as well. Your chest is getting the full brunt of the wind on the descent, so dress appropriately.
• It takes longer to react when tearing down a mountain, so keep a good buffer between you and the rider in front.


4. CORNERING
Cornering is the key factor when it comes to descending. Do this well and it feels fantastic. Get it wrong and you risk crashing, leaving a lot of skin on the road. Unsurprisingly, it takes a bit of experience to build up confidence, and it’s normal to feel nervous at first. The key elements are body and bike positioning.
• Get on the drops with your fingers on the brakes. Again, this increases your traction and control, and also distributes your body weight more evenly between the front and rear tyres.
Sitting up on the hoods will make you top heavy and less stable.
• Always look beyond the corner. If you focus on the obstacle coming up at speed, (ie. the bend), you will just freeze up. Focus on the exit – past the corner to where you want to go.
• Keep your body in line with your bike as much as possible. Lean into the corner with the bike, not just with your body.
• Keep your inside leg up and your outside leg straight, bearing the bulk of your weight. This will prevent your pedal touching the ground and potentially flipping you off the bike. With your weight on the outside leg, extend your inside arm slightly. This will distribute your body weight more evenly, giving you more traction on the road, keeping the bike rigid, and enabling you to cut a tighter line.
• You can also move back slightly on the saddle, shifting your weight away from the front.
• Stay light in the saddle so that you can respond better to the varying road surfaces and bumps.
• As you approach the corner, you need to swiftly assess the situation; how tight is it? Are there any hazards such as potholes or gravel? Are there oncoming cars or other riders? These things will determine how fast you can take the corner, and whether you can risk going onto the wrong side of the road.
• If conditions are wet, make sure you slow right down – your traction will be severely compromised. Also, keep an eagle eye out for manhole covers and road markings
• Brake before you enter the corner. You want to wash off some speed before you hit the corner, not when you’re already in it.
Braking hard while cornering will severely compromise your traction on the road and could cause you to skid.
• If it is a tight hairpin bend, or you are unsure, slow right down and brake before the bend. If it’s a softer, wider corner, you can hit it at speed.
• Once you’ve established the corner, set up your approach. Enter the corner as wide as possible, cutting in as close to its apex as you can, then exit as wide as you can on the opposite side – thus straightening the corner out as much as possible.


5. BRAKING
Braking is a surprisingly complex skill that, as with all aspects of bike handling, only improves with practice. As you may have noticed, your bike has two brakes – one on the front wheel and one on the back. When braking, it’s important to use both of them. The front brake is most effective at stopping you. A lot of newer cyclists shy away from putting too much front brake on, fearing they will go over the bars or the front wheel will slide out from under them. These scenarios can occur, but only if the front is deployed in the wrong situations. In normal, dry conditions, applying more front brake – or even solely front brake – will stop you faster and 99 per cent of the time will not result in a skid.
When traction is poor (eg. in wet conditions, when there is a lot of loose gravel on the road, or in the unusual circumstance of braking whilst cornering), the front brake is a riskier strategy, and may well end up in a skid. In these conditions, use the back brake to slow you down. Rather than grabbing handfuls of brake, increase the pressure slowly, giving yourself plenty of time to slow and stop. Practice braking hard, and then releasing the brake and reapplying it. This is a good strategy for a faster stop, as it can help you gain some control over your bike and prevent a skid situation – a little like the ABS brakes on a car.
Some braking tips
• When applying the front brake hard to stop as quickly as possible, lock your arms out in front of you to brace yourself against the deceleration.
• While braking, shift your weight as far back as you can comfortably go. By keeping your centre of gravity low and far back, you’ll maximise your traction and minimise the risk of going head over handlebars.
• A good tip in the wet is to lightly apply your brakes so that the pads drag lightly on the wheels’ rims. This will help clear excess water and improve the efficacy of the brakes.
• As a rule, feather your brakes to slow gradually. Especially in a group ride, avoid grabbing handfuls of brake.
