He scored two tries, was IBM TryTracker's Key Influencer, named BBC's man of the match, and now Telegraph Sport readers agree that Ben Youngs was the star performer in England's 55-35 win over France on Saturday at Twickenham.
The scrum-half ran 90 metres with ball in hand and assisted a number of other tries for the hosts. In the poll he scored an impressive 65 per cent of the vote, beating teammate George Ford (22 per cent).
Other England players who featured included Jack Nowell – another who scored a brace – with 4 per cent and Billy Vunipola, who had five per cent.
For France the most popular performer was Fijian-born winger Noa Nakaitaci, who earned 2 per cent.
