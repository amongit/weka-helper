Nick Kyrgios of Australia to miss time with foot injury
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) -- Nick Kyrgios of Australia says he will be out at least 2 to 4 weeks with a foot injury.
The tennis player fell and rolled his ankle in the ninth game of the last set of his match at the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday. He lost to No. 11 seed Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (4).
Kyrgios managed to break back in that game and had a chance to serve out a win before losing.
He tweeted news of his injury Monday.
''Bad news guys, I have damaged ligaments in my foot & will be out for at least 2-4 weeks which means no Miami for me this year,'' he wrote.
Kyrgios was scheduled to play the two-week Miami Open that begins March 23.
