England's Zoe Smith beat Nigeria's Ndidi Winifred and Welsh veteran Michaela Breeze to win the women's 58kg weightlifting in Glasgow on Saturday.
But it's been a tough year for the 20-year-old athlete, who has suffered a number of injuries and saw her funding cut by British Weight Lifting for being “overweight”.
"I spent most of last year rehabbing my back," explains Zoe. "There were times where I thought 'why am i even doing this?'"
However, perseverance and strong will has paid off for the young weightlifter.
"I'm just glad to have made it now," she said.
