There were a raft of brilliant fights in the UFC in 2014. Choosing a top 10 is never easy. But the crew at UFC: Beyond The Octagon at BT Sport and I came up with our list of 2014.
There were some amazing fights from every division, and it was a year in which the great fights reflected the fact that it is not always the biggest names who are involved in the best contests. In 2013, Jon Jones against Alex Gustafsson stood out strongly as one of the greatest MMA title fights of all time.
It has perhaps been a different type of year in 2014. Here's the long, long shortlist below which we compiled.
Which is your No1, and which top 10 would you pick? Have we, indeed, missed some fights which you would have included? Let us know in the comments section below.
And while we are on it, why not Tweet #GarethADaviesDT who your fighter of 2014 has been, and your reasoning?
Watch the selection we made on UFC: Beyond The Octagon on BT Sport at 9pm. And a merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all fight freaks out there ...
