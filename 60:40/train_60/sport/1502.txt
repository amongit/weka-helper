2012 tyres will be different says Pirelli boss Paul Hembery
Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery reveals the Formula 1 tyre supplier has "changed the profile and structure" of their new tyres for 2012, in order to "reduce blistering" and "put more rubber on the ground".
Hembery also reveals the company have attempted to reduced the difference in performance between the 'soft' and 'hard' compound slick tyres to just 0.8 seconds per lap, estimating teams and drivers will be "more prepared" than they were when Pirelli took over suppliying tyres to Formula 1 from Bridgestone in 2011.
