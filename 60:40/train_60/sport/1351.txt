Andy Murray will lead Great Britain's Davis Cup charge from the front

What was Andy Murray up to on Thursday when he said: “It’s unlikely I would play the doubles on Saturday”? The comment could be taken at face value, but if so it seems strange that he would volunteer such information to the Americans ahead of Friday’s selection deadline, which does not arrive until noon.
More likely, Murray – who will open this Davis Cup tie at 1pm on Friday against Donald Young – was just trying to throw a few seeds of confusion into the opposition camp. It is true that playing three best-of-five-set matches on successive days is an exhausting business, and that the last time he attempted it – in Naples last April – his weekend ended in a frustrating defeat at the hands of Fabio Fognini.

But this is a very different situation. Where the Italians produced a dubious outdoor clay court with a muddy patch in one corner, Great Britain are about to go out in front of a home crowd in an indoor arena which they have fashioned to their own specifications.
If the tie happens to be poised at 1-1 after Friday’s matches, which the rankings suggest it should be, then it would be a brave call for team captain Leon Smith to omit his best player from a doubles rubber that could decide the whole thing.
“We don’t know who they’re going to throw at us,” said Bob Bryan, half of the American Bryan twins who have dominated the world’s doubles tournaments for the past decade. “They’ve got a few options and we’re prepared for every one. I’m sure the fans want to see the Murrays [Andy and Jamie] versus the Bryans – the marquee matchup. But Dom Inglot has the hot hand, he’s played us well in the last couple of matches, so we’re prepared for him too.”
Are the Bryans vulnerable this weekend? They have certainly been below their usual perfectionist standards this season, as their early position of just 13th in the race to the ATP World Tour Finals might suggest.
Meanwhile, Inglot has not just had a hot hand but the upper hand in their recent meetings: along with his Romanian partner Florin Mergea, he knocked them out of the Australian Open in January and then the Dubai Duty Free Championships last week.
But the tricky thing is that, although Smith provisionally named Inglot alongside Jamie Murray on the draw-sheet yesterday, these two have limited experience of each other’s games. Whereas the Murray brothers not only grew up playing together, but have combined to claim two ATP doubles titles (at Valencia in 2010 and Tokyo the following year). On top of that, Andy Murray also referred to their shared Olympic experiences, which yielded much satisfaction if no actual metalware.
“If I look back,” he said, “getting to compete at the Olympics together two times – even though we might have liked to have done better – nobody would ever have expected that from two guys who grew up together playing tennis in Dunblane, where there had never been any tennis players before. We’ve been very lucky, because it’s very unlikely that something like that would ever happen again.”
