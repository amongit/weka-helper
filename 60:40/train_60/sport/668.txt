William Gallas has quit football after a career that spanned nearly 20 years and saw him play for all three of London's top clubs.
The 37-year-old Gallas started at French club Caen in 1995 before moving to Chelsea in 2001, and went on to have stints at both Arsenal and north London rivals Tottenham.
Gallas, who has 84 international caps with France and was a member of the squad that lost to Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, won the Premier League title twice, in 2005 and 2006 with Chelsea.
"One always thinks he can keep going, but today I can't take it any more," the former Marseille player said in an interview with L'Equipe 21 TV channel.
Gallas helped Chelsea win two league titles under Jose Mourinho before he moved to Arsenal in 2006 in a deal that saw Ashley Cole move the other way.

The defender was a disruptive figure in north London and manager Arsene Wenger stripped him of the club's captaincy after he publicly criticised his teammates.
He also sparked controversy with an extraordinary reaction to Arsenal conceding a last-minute equaliser at Birmingham in 2009, sitting down on the half-way line and refusing to leave the pitch.
Gallas joined Tottenham in 2010 but was released, after a largely unsuccessful spell, in 2013, when he signed a one-year deal with Perth Glory in Australia's A-League.
Gallas scored five goals with France, including the much-disputed equaliser that sent his country to the 2010 World Cup in a playoff win over Ireland after Thierry Henry used his hand to control the ball before crossing it to his teammate.
France exited the tournament in South Africa in a miserable fashion, as Raymond Domenech's players went on strike at a training session shortly before they were eliminated at the group stage. Gallas, who ended his international career following the tournament, blamed Domenech for the fiasco, saying the problems came from the coach's poor management.
