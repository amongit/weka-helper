Chris Froome makes 2015 Tour de France his main target

Chris Froome has ended any uncertainty over his participation in the Tour de France next summer by confirming that the race would provide the “main focus” to his 2015 season.
Froome had raised eyebrows by hinting following the Tour route announcement in October that he might skip the 102nd edition of the most prestigious race in the world in order to target a Giro d'Italia-Vuelta a España double.
It was felt at the time that the 2013 champion was probably just venting his frustration at an itinerary that features a tough, classics-style first week and just 13.7 kilometres of individual time trialling, which is Froome’s biggest strength relative to his general classification rivals.
Stephen Roche, writing in the Telegraph, said that he would be "staggered" if one of the best climbers in the world did not line up for a race featuring five mountaintop finishes.
“A Giro d’Italia-Vuelta a España double is all well and good,” the 1987 champion said. “It would be an incredible feat. But in terms of sponsors and visibility, it is all about the Tour. I’m sure when they all sit down, they will decide that they simply cannot miss out.”

That appears to be the case, with Froome – who crashed out of the race this year on the cobbles of stage five – confirming his plans to Team Sky’s website.
“At this point in my career, I feel the Tour takes priority,” said Froome, 29, who is training in South Africa. “It’s a climbers’ Tour next year so I’m going to have to work extra hard in the mountains and spend less time on practising time-trialling.
“I enjoy the challenge and there’s no reason why I would be any worse off than any of the other contenders. It is our responsibility as a team to adapt accordingly so that we can be as competitive as possible there.”
Froome added that the challenge laid down by rival team owner Oleg Tinkov to compete in all three of 2015’s Grand Tours for a prize fund of €1 million (£792,000) was “appealing” but unrealistic.
“I know how hard it is to do two Grand Tours while targeting the overall win,” he said.
“There may come a time at some point down the line where other races may take preference, but, for 2015, it’s the Tour.”
