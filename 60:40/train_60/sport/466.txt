The Renault Clio left the road and flipped over. It landed on its roof in three feet of water, trapping driver Patrick Osowiecki and navigator Maciej Wrona inside.
With no race officials in sights, half a dozen quick-thinking spectators stripped off their clothes and jumped into the water to rescue the pair.
The group lifted the car onto the passenger side, enabling Osowiecki to open his door and climb to safety with Wrona.
The accident took place during the third round of the Polish Cup rally, which was held in the south east of Poland around the towns of Kazimierz Dolny, Pulawy and Kozienice.
