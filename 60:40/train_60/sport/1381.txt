Roy Hodgson has called two goalkeepers into his England squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy after the withdrawal of Fraser Forster.
QPR's Rob Green is recalled and Jack Butland of Stoke City moves up from the Under-21 side after Southampton's Forster suffered a serious knee injury.
Tottenham left-back Danny Rose replaces Luke Shaw of Manchester United.
England meet Lithuania at Wembley in a Euro 2016 qualifier next week before a friendly in Italy on 31 March.
Green has been capped 12 times by England, but has only appeared once for his country since the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Butland has won one cap at senior level, against Italy in 2012 as a 19-year-old, and has captained Gareth Southgate's Under-21 side this season.
"We regard Jack Butland as the third keeper," said Hodgson when originally naming his squad.
Goalkeepers: Joe Hart (Manchester City), Rob Green (Queens Park Rangers), Jack Butland (Stoke City).
Defenders: Leighton Baines (Everton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton), Kieran Gibbs (Arsenal), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur).
Midfielders: Ross Barkley (Everton), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Fabian Delph (Aston Villa), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), James Milner (Manchester City), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Andros Townsend (Tottenham Hotspur), Theo Walcott (Arsenal).
Forwards: Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Danny Welbeck (Arsenal).
