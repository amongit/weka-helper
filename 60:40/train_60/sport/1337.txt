Harlequins finished their Champions Cup campaign with a bang and a lot of regrets as their demolition of Castres was rendered null and void by Leinster’s profligacy at the Ricoh Arena.
Rarely can a seven-try victory in France have felt as bittersweet as this. The regrets hark back to the results in the last two rounds, the losses away to Leinster and more pertinently at home to Wasps last week. That left them needing a bonus-point victory at the Stade Pierre Antoine, which was duly sealed when Jack Clifford went over in the 49th minute, and help from elsewhere. Indeed Conor O’Shea, the Harlequins director of rugby, spent the latter stages watching a feed of the Wasps v Leinster game. But the help never arrived as the draw relegated them to third place in Pool 2.
“Ian Madigan is a 80-90 per cent kicker and I think he was three from seven today,” O’Shea said. “We could only control what we could control. You can’t rely on others and that’s the position we left ourselves in.
“Ultimately not getting anything out of that [Wasps] game cost us. We have gone out by inches, but that’s the European Cup for you. We will learn from it but we will also use the hurt to drive us on for the remainder of the season.”
It was hard to reconcile yourself to the fact that Quins were ripping apart the Top 14 finalists from last season and the 2013 French champions rather than an Italian whipping boy. Castres had given up the ghost a long time ago in this competition to concentrate on staying alive in the Top 14. When Mark Lambert slices through your defensive line then you know you have issues.

Last week, Quins paid the price for their devil-may-care attitude against Wasps, but in Castres they found their perfect soulmate to chuck the ball around with carefree abandon. Ten tries were scored but it could easily have been double that number had few more passes stuck. Harlequins were slightly more clinical in that department and less slipshod in defence.
There were first half tries from Joe Marler, from a lineout drive, Charlie Walker, after brilliantly standing up Remi Tales, and Danny Care in a trademark snipe from a ruck. Castres were still in touch with Mike Brown, who was in the wars after clashing heads with George Lowe, missing a tackle that allowed Antoine Dupont to score before Romain Cabannes also struck.
The second-half was entirely one sided, particularly once Lambert and then Yarde scored within the space of a minute. Lowe’s converted try at the death ensured Harlequins met O’Shea’s prematch target of a 28-point win, but it proved a futile wish.
