Kelly Gallagher, Charlotte Dujardin, Lizzie Yarnold. Jo Pavey: 40 per cent of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year shortlist this year were women.
Despite a man finally winning the accolade , the shortlist was a reflection of a soaring year of achievement for British sportswomen.
Yarnold and Gallagher set the tone for the year in Sochi.
First Yarnold shot down the skeleton bob slope, to seize the gold medal.
Then Gallagher won the Winter Paralympics downhill for the visually impaired.

Jo Pavey won gold for running, not giving birth. Ok BBC?
Meanwhile Pavey proved in the European Championship 10,000 metres in Zurich that 40 is the new 20.
She beat a field of athletes half her age to steal her first championship title.
Then came Charlotte Dujardin, the woman who puts the elegance into equestrianism.
She added a world championship title to her Olympic victories in the Greenwich Arena in 2012.
