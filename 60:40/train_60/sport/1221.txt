Tottenham can qualify for Champions League and end 'Spursy' image as heroic failures, insists Christian Eriksen

Type “Spursy” into an internet search engine and it is not hard to find the Urban Dictionary definition that says: “To consistently and inevitably fail to live up to expectations. To bottle it.” Christian Eriksen did not know the slang term for Tottenham Hotspur’s ability to shoot themselves in the foot, but was well aware that the club have been known for a failure to get over the line.
Critics may well argue that the Denmark midfielder and his Tottenham team-mates have shown some ‘Spursy’ tendencies this month by losing the Capital One Cup final to Chelsea and producing their worst half of football in last week’s 3-0 defeat against Manchester United, just as a top-four Premier League finish was looking like a realistic prospect.
Tottenham's performance against Man Utd was woeful
Eriksen, however, believes the current group of Spurs players can consign the term ‘Spursy’ to history and use the Capital One Cup final to breed a winning mentality.
“We can change the reputation, I really think so,” said Eriksen. “We have a really young team and people can still develop into something better. Hopefully, it will go in the right direction and, definitely, we have to show we can be a team to cross the line.
“It helped that we played the final, with the pressure. Everybody got in the mood and I don’t think anybody wants that feeling of losing again – exhausted and still just moaning because we could have done better. That helped everyone to take a look at what is needed at the top level and in important games.”

Tottenham are six points behind fourth-placed United going into today’s game against bottom-of-the-table Leicester City and Eriksen still believes Champions League qualification is up for grabs.
Asked whether Spurs’ season is effectively over, Eriksen emphatically replied: “No. Not for us. We knew before the game with United that there would be 10 finals. Of course we hoped for a better result, but then we didn’t get what we wanted because we played one of our worst first halves of the season.
“But we’ve still got nine games to go. You lose one game and you are supposedly out of it. You win one and you are in again. So, hopefully, we will keep winning and we will see where we are.”
Spurs need to rediscover that winning mentality
The character of the Tottenham team has been questioned more than once and by more than one manager over the past couple of years, but Eriksen dismissed the theory that they lack leaders.
“That’s a myth 100 per cent,” he said. “We have a few players who will say something if it goes wrong and if it goes well everyone will probably say a bit more.
“It can be that you say something to a team-mate or to the whole group. It’s more about talking as a team and being together, instead of shouting and screaming. You don’t want to be just talking for no reason, you want to say something that helps.”
Eriksen has experience of crossing the line with Ajax, where he won three successive Dutch titles and helped the club to claw back deficits to achieve their goal.
Eriksen was used to winning titles with Ajax
“Always with Ajax it was a fight to win the title,” he said. “The first two seasons we played six months average and then the last six months we played really well, and that’s where we got the points – at the end.
“The first season the gap between Twente at the top and Ajax was 11 points, and we ended up being champions. So I’ve done it before. It was hard, but it is possible.”
Eriksen became used to playing Champions League football at Ajax and was part of the team that beat Manchester City in the competition in 2012.
The 23-year-old is desperate to play on Europe’s biggest stage again, but insists he would not give up a place in the Europa League next season to try to boost a Champions League push.

“Everybody who has played in the Champions League knows that the feeling is different,” said Eriksen. “Right now you sit at home and you watch it on the TV, and then you speak about it the next day. It’s just about the Champions League. ‘Did you see this? Did you see that?’ There was a big difference between watching it and playing in it. You had the chance to play. You had the song when you went on the pitch. You had the atmosphere, the fans, everything was just more exciting. It gives you such a boost to play in the Champions League.”
Tottenham qualified for the Champions League in 2010, when they had not been competing in the Europa League.
“The Europa League, it’s a lot of travelling and it’s a day later before you play at the weekend,” said Eriksen. “Of course the squads are so big that it shouldn’t be an issue. But it probably is because you have so many extra games if you play for qualification. You have some games in Kiev or far away, whereas for the bigger teams in the Champions League it is generally around the corner.
“For me personally, though, if I can’t play in the Champions League, I would like to play in the Europa League. Because there is a chance you could win the Europa League and go into the Champions League!

“It’s not only for that. You get the chance to show off somewhere else and you play somewhere else, instead of just teams in the Premier League.
“You see differences when you play against an Italian team, they play differently. A Spanish team, they play differently. So you learn a few things and I think that’s good for everyone in their careers to play as many games as possible and not just in the domestic league.”
Eriksen will be away from his domestic league next week, as he meets up with Denmark and can beat Michael Laudrup’s record by becoming the youngest player to reach 50 caps.
“I still have to achieve a little bit to get to Laudrup, but we’ll see in a few years,” said Eriksen.
Tottenham also have a little bit to achieve to shake off the ‘Spursy’ reputation, but Eriksen is clearly determined to lead them over the line.
Tottenham Hotspur will be wearing special edition shirts during the match with Leicester City, supporting the AIA China Youth Football Development programme, an initiative that aims to provide sporting opportunities to disadvantaged young people in rural China. Two young people from Dulou Village, Guangdong, will be team mascots for the game.
