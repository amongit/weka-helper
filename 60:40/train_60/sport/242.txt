Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao have made their first joint appearance to promote their highly anticipated bout.

Mayweather and Pacquiao were polite and deferential as they took the stage together at the Nokia Theatre in downtown on Los Angeles on Wednesday, facing off for the first time.
After a half-decade of negotiations and false starts, Mayweather and Pacquiao will meet at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2.

Mayweather says he has never wanted to win a fight so badly in his life. Pacquiao says this is the biggest fight of his career.
The fighters won't appear together again until fight week.
