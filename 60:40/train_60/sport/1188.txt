Referee Neil Swarbrick apologises for sending off wrong West Brom player

Referee Neil Swarbrick has apologised after sending off the wrong West Bromwich Albion player at Manchester City.
The incident centred on a foul on City striker Wilfried Bony in the second minute at the Etihad Stadium.
Bony was clearly fouled by Craig Dawson just outside the penalty area, only for the Ivory Coast international to try and pick himself up to continue his run.
McAuley then also made a challenge on Bony in the area, but given Swarbrick chose to award a free-kick to City, and not a penalty, he was clearly punishing the first challenge.
Controversy: This challenge from Gareth McAuley on Wilfried Bony was deemed worthy of a red card - but the real foul had been committed seconds earlier

To the amazement of the West Brom players and their manager Tony Pulis, however, Swarbrick chose to show the red card to McAuley.
After the game, Swarbrick apologised for the errir via statement through the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd.
The statement read: "In the second minute of Manchester City v West Bromwich Albion, referee Neil Swarbrick made a decision to send off Gareth McAuley for a 'denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity' offence.
"The referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player, which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity. The referee has apologised for his error."
It is the second case of the wrong player being shown a red card in the Premier League in recent weeks: Sunderland's Wes Brown was dismissed at Manchester United, despite the foul being committed by John O'Shea.
West Brom boss Tony Pulis called for the greater use of technology after the incident.
Pulis said: "Refereeing is not easy, especially at the level we are at now and how quick the game is.
"This product is one of the greatest products this country now sells all over the world, but it is no good moaning about referees. What we have to do is find a way to help referees out.
"I would definitely call now for managers to have two calls each and every game, where there are 30 seconds and they can have a video link-up with people upstairs who can watch it on video.
"It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football. We have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better."
