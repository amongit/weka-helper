Fab Melo To Celtics With 22nd Pick In 2012 NBA Draft
BOSTON (AP) â€” The Boston Celtics have chosen Syracuse center Fab Melo with the 22nd pick of the NBA draft.

A talented defender and shot blocker, Melo was the second big man chosen by Boston. They also had the 21st pick, which they used to take Ohio State forward Jared Sullinger. Boston's second-round pick is the 51st overall.

Melo led Syracuse with 5.8 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game while averaging 7.8 points per game last season but missed the NCAA tournament because of academic issues. Syracuse was eliminated in the Elite Eight by Ohio State, 77-70.

The 7-0, 255-pound Melo played sparingly as a freshman but was named Big East defensive player of the year as a sophomore when he set a school record with 10 blocks against Seton Hall.
