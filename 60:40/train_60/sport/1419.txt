Pakistan pace bowler Wahab Riaz and Australia all-rounder Shane Watson have been fined after a fiery confrontation in Friday's World Cup quarter-final.
Riaz was penalised 50% of his match fee by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for using "aggressive and abusive language" at the end of an over.
Watson lost 15% of his fee for "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game" after a verbal exchange with Riaz.
The flashpoint came after the 33rd over of Australia's successful run chase.
An ICC statement read: "Watson ignored the umpires' instructions and verbally engaged with Wahab, who, at the end of the over, followed through towards the batsman and used aggressive and abusive language."
Left-armer Riaz peppered Watson with an array of fast, short-pitched deliveries, in a spell described by Australia captain Michael Clarke as "as good as any I've faced in one-day cricket for a long time".
However, Watson who was crucially dropped at long leg off Riaz, held out long enough to see Australia to a six-wicket win.
Match referee Ranjan Madugalle added: "It was an enthralling contest between Shane and Wahab, but in the closing stages of the match both players crossed that fine line between intense competition and unacceptable behaviour."
