21.44 That's that. Wales lose 19-12 and will face New Zealand in the quarter finals, while their opponents are in with a shout of a medal I reckon. We're done for the night here and I'm off to get some sleep. Night folks!
21.38 Samoa go over in the corner and Wales are in trouble.
21.37 In fact that's it. It's a games-record winning win for Australia, who will summit the medal table at the close of play today. Canada take silver and England bronze.
21.36 Australia pulling clear now, the tussle is on between Canada and England for silver. We're back underway in the rugby too.
21.35 Australia are leading Canada by 0.05 seconds in the women's freestyle relay, England in third.
21.34 Wales are pressing for a try to take them into the lead at half-time, but after the clock had reached zero the ball went loose and Toloa ran in unchallenged from 85m. Half-time it's Samoa 14-7 Wales.
21.32 Wales have just recovered very well from captain Luke Morgan being absolutely smashed into the depths of the Ibrox turf and Will Harries picked up to scoot over from the 22. It's converted and that makes it 7-7. A draw would see Wales top the pool.
21.26 We're just waiting for the women's 4x200m relay to begin now, but in the sevens it's Wales v Samoa. Both sides are already through to the quarter-finals, but the loser of this one gets to play New Zealand next. This will be a tight one I reckon, with Samoa just to nick it.
21.21 Adam Peaty, incidentally, set a new British record of 58.94 seconds in his gold-medal winning run.
At Ibrox we get the biggest cheers of the games as Scotland's win is confirmed, as is their quarter-final spot. They'll play South Africa or Kenya. They'll play South Africa.
21.18 Stuart Hogg is on now for Scotland. Here's a shot of a familiar sight throughout the day.

21.16 That will be Scotland into the quarter-finals as Bennett steps down the blindside and jinks through for a try on the left. The outstanding kicker Gregor converts from wide and it's 21-5 with 3.30 to go.
21.13 Australia's lead in the medals table lasts all of five minutes! Adam Peaty strikes straight back for England in the men's 100m breaststroke! Ross Murdoch gets the bronze for Scotland.
21.11 That gold for Seebohm puts Australia on top of the medals table with 16 golds (the same as England) and 49 medals overall. Scotland have pulled away with another try and lead 14-5 at the break.
21.08 We have an Australian gold medalist in the women's 100m backstroke and it's Emily Seebohm who wins it with a games record time of 59.37. 23-year-old Welsh swimmer Georgia Davies gets the silver though.
Canada have bagged a try in the corner, but the conversion is miles off. 7-5 to Scotland with 30 seconds to go in the first half.
21.06 Right we've got a big match now in the sevens, with Scotland and Canada in an effective knock-out match to see who goes through to the quarter-finals. Scotland start well and Lee Jones gets the first try. Stuart Hogg and Sean Lamont are on the bench.
21.00 We're into the final stretch now, hour twelve of today's coverage. Two things to report: first that Uganda have scored a try at the death to break Sri Lankan hearts and send their fans - who are surprisingly numerous - into raptures. They can't qualify, but finish the group in third with five points, because, ridiculously, you get a point for a loss here.
Second, Jonathan Liew reports that Manx cyclist Peter Kennaugh, who came second in the points race today, is not happy with his Sky overlords.
<noframe>Twitter: Jonathan Liew - After silver today, Pete Kennaugh blasts Sky over lack of opportunities: "It's starting to get frustrating. Put some faith in your riders."</noframe>
20.56 I've just realised that Australia's national anthem sounds like 'All Things Bright and Beautiful'. Sharp analysis is what you'll get from me.
20.55 England's Ben Proud misses out on the 100m freestyle final, but team-mates Adam Brown and James Disney-May qualify.
20.48 In news to warm the cockles of the Ibrox crowd Sri Lanka have the lead 7-0 against Uganda. And speaking of rugby minnows, here's a missive from Gordon Bradshaw.
Well done Barbados. A respectable score line for a country with one rugby pitch in the middle of a horse race track and a population of 250,000
Indeed. Our fears of a world-record thumping weren't unfounded given the respective statuses of the two sides, but they didn't embarass themselves at all.
20.44 Swimming it is then, although not before the men's 100m freestyle semi-finals. We're running behind here, folks.
20.42 We're nothing if not a democracy here, so it's time for you to vote by Twitter: would you rather I watch Sri Lanka v Uganda in the sevens, or the men's 100m backstroke final in the swimming? What's that? No need for a what? Oh.
20.37 Full-time: New Zealand 59-0 Barbados. Colour me shocked.
20.36 With the cycling done for the day, here's Paralympian Sarah Storey.
<noframe>Twitter: Dame Sarah Storey - Phew that was an exciting session! Huge congrats to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/craigmaclean5" target="_blank">@craigmaclean5</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/neilfachie" target="_blank">@neilfachie</a> on another gold &amp; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/elinorbarker" target="_blank">@elinorbarker</a> on that fab bronze too! :)</noframe>
20.33 Since that yellow card New Zealand have scored a couple more tries, the last coming when the ball was allowed to bounce from kick-off and the ABs simply picked it up and scored. We've had an email on the match actually, from John Lowe:
Wonder how many NZ would need to have in the bin before Barbados could actually score?
Eight.
20.31 A yellow card for New Zealand's Sam Dickson for a tip tackle. He's lucky not to become the first player to see red in these 2014 "friendly" games. Scotland's Chris Sherrington brings his side's judo campaign to an end with yet another gold in the 100kg+ category.
20.29 The Commonwealth Games record score is 85-0, held by Samoa since 1998 when they beat Trinidad & Tobago. The All Blacks score from kick-off in the second half, running in unopposed from their own 22 to make it 42-0.
20.26 Poor old Billy Ocean's kid. When the going gets tough... his side get going 35-0 down.
20.22 It's taken a couple of minutes but New Zealand are in for the opening try against Barbados in pouring rain. In other news, Chris Walker-Hebborn has qualified for the men's 50m backstroke final, England will play India in the table tennis final after beating Wales 3-0 and the Welsh team beat Trinidad & Tobago at netball 43-19.
In the time it's taken me to write that, New Zealand scored two more tries and lead 21-0... make that 28-0.
20.12 Bronze for Wales in the men's 100kg+ judo - yes that's a judo medal that Scotland haven't won, folks - and it goes to Mark Shaw. In the rugby, New Zealand will face Barbados shortly. Just remember, Barbados lost 68-7 to Canada, who lost 39-0 to the All Blacks.
<noframe>Twitter: Nick Mullins - Ought to know what the record score is at the Commonwealth Games, but hard to believe it won't be threatened shortly...NZ V Barbados.</noframe>
20.10 It's quiet right now, but Fran Halsall has just set yet another games record in qualifying fastest for the women's 50m butterfly final. That's her 978th record of these games.
20.00 To reiterate:
<noframe>Twitter: Zoe Smith - Ok so, I'm Commonwealth Games Champion!</noframe>
19.57 More medals! It's a gold for Scotland, with Sarah Adlington winning the final of the women's +78kg judo. she beat England's Jodie Myers, which means Myers gets silver. Obviously.
19.47 Cornal Hendricks has just scored a hat-trick inside a minute for South Africa against the Cook Islands at Ibrox. I know I said that sevens was the best sport here, but it's hard to justify with scores like this: 50-0 that one finishes and South Africa look good.
Ibrox sounds great right now with the near-sell-out crowd singing and clapping along to Franz Ferdinand's indie pop classic 'Take Me Out'. Anyhow, here's a picture of Euan Burton cooly celebrating his earlier gold.

19.43 Scotland's Hannah Miley is struggling for bronze in the women's 200m breaststroke. Taylor McKeown heads up an Australian 1-2 ahead of Sally Hunter but Molly Renshaw picks up the bronze for England with a late surge. Miley is in fourth.
19.41 We've also just seen Daniel Fox (Australia) win gold in the para-sport S14 200m freestyle, ahead of England's Tom Hamer and Wales' Jack Thomas.
19.35 So what do we have to look forward to in the last couple of hours this evening?
- The women's +78kg judo final - The men's +100kg judo final - Wales v Trinidad & Tobago netball (this is underway) - A whole lotta rugby until very late - The women's 200m breaststroke final - The women's 100m backstroke final - The men's 100m breaststroke final - The women's 4x200m freestyle relay final - Some more weightlifting
19.34 Update: dear god I am tired.
19.29 Good work by the organisers as Burton's win is greeted by this cracker. Peter Kennaugh of the Isle of Man took silver in the points race, by the way.

19.26 We're approaching the end of hour ten of our liveblog and we have two more gold medals to report. Euan Burton of Scotland has won the judo men's -100kg competition against Shah Hussain Shah of Pakistan and Tom Scully has won the men's cycling points race.
In rugby, Samoa have gone 54-0 up on the final whistle against Malaysia.
19.17 And it's another gold for England in the pool. Fran Halsall ga just beaten favourite Cate Campbell by 0.04 seconds to get both a stunning win and yet another games record in the women's 50m freestyle.
19.10 Right, simple question for you readers: what's the best sport at the games? I'm standing firmly behind the rugby sevens, but we'll tear our gaze away from Samoa v Malaysia for a moment to note that South Africa's Chad Le Clos has taken a, er, close gold in the men's 200m butterfly with a time of 1:56.98.
Tom Scully has moved ahead in the cycling with 20 laps left.
19.09 We have some All Blacks fans here taking their name a bit too literally.

19.05 A nation rejoices as England picks up a gold medal in the Queen's Prize Pairs shooting. Or is that two gold medals? I'm pretty certain that only counts as one. Still, congratulations go to both David Luckman and Parag Patel, as well as to Scotland's Ian Shaw and Angus McLeod, who win bronze.
Wales have beaten Papua New Guinea 29-7.
18.59 It's been a frustrating match for Papua New Guinea, who have had their chances but haven't been able to take them. They're 17-0 down and Wales introduce Will Harries, the fourth former Saintsman to appear today.
Halfway through the men's points race at the velodrome now and Peter Kennaugh of the Isle of Man is leading on 66 points.
James Davies has just scored another for Wales. He's the brother of Wales and Lions centre Jonathan.
18.44 The men's points race final is the final event at the velodrome tonight and the 40km race is now in its early stages. In the sevens, England have scored a last-minute try through John Brake, ably assisted by his former Northampton Saints academy team-mate Christian Lewis-Pratt, to put the gloss on a slightly unconvincing 40-0 win over Uganada; they'll need to improve against Australia late on tonight.
Up next at Ibrox it's Wales v Papua New Guinea, which should be a good match. I've also just found out that Barbados's Anthony Bayne-Charles is the son of none other than this man...

18.40 The women's -78kg final in the judo is on now between Powell (Wales) and Gemma Gibbons (England). Bragging rights reside west of the Severn as Natalie Powell picks up a thumping win to take gold.
18.29 It seems to have flown under the radar a bit, but it's been a very good day for India. Rahi Sarnobat has just won gold in the 25m pistol shooting, just ahead of her teammate Anisa Sayyed, while the Australian Lalita Yauhleuskaya came in third.
In judo Scotland have picked up two more medals in the -90kg category. Andy Burns gets bronze and Matthew Purssey is beaten in the final by South Africa's Zack Piontek.
At half time in the sevens it's England 21-0 Uganda.
18.26 That's been swiftly followed by the most predictable reaction of the day ahead of kick-off between England and Uganda.
<noframe>Twitter: Heather Stewart - English supporter just told some Scots off for cheering for Uganda (against England). That went down well. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
England have taken an early 7-0 lead.
18.19 The clock has run down to zero at Ibrox but Scotland want another try and indeed Colin Shaw dummies and, with his first touch of the ball, goes under the posts from 50. Eight tries in all, all converted and it finishes 56-0.
"You'd expect New Zealand to beat Barbados," says the commentator. Ladies and gentlemen, we have the commentary understatment of the games.
18.14 The rugby is back! And it doesn't look like we're going to see an end to the one-sided results from the off as Scotland face Barbados. It's now 35-0 to the West Indian side hosts as Sean Lamont has just gone over.
18.10 Never mind that, Scott Sunderland of Australia has just blitzed the track and moved into the gold medal position. The means Archibald's games record has gone too, 1:06.75 his time. In fact Archibald is down to the bronze medal position as his fellow New Zealander Simon van Velthooven has come in second. It means that there will be no medals for England's Clancy and Emadi.
18.06 New Zealand's Matthew Archibald has taken the lead in the men's time trial with a new games record. He leads from England's Ed Clancy and Kian Emadi.
18.03 I promised you backflip photos and I'll be damned if I don't deliver on my liveblog promises, folks. Here is the 20-year-old double-Commonwealth-medalist, Commonwealth champion weightlifter who can also do backflips. But could she throw a shoe over a pub?


17.59 In another unsurprising hockey result, Scotland fought back... kind of. They ended with a 6-2 defeat against India, which is an improvement after being 5-0 down.
17.45 The headlines tomorrow will surely be about Zoe Smith and her brilliant win in the weightlifting. "I've done it, I've done it," were her understandably excited words upon claiming the win, shortly after she celebrated with a backflip (I'll keep looking for a photo of this). Jones won bronze in India four years ago: then she became the first British woman to win a Commonwealth weightlifting medal and now she's the first to win a Commonwealth weightlifting gold. At this juncture, let's remember she's just 20 years old and reflect on our own lives a bit.

17.43 I'll be heading to the pool in an hour or so - and how I wish I didn't mean that figuratively, given London's heat at the moment - but sticking at the velodrome for now the men's 1000m time trial is underway. It's early, but England's Steven Burke leads.
17.37 Apparently the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome is awash with The Proclaimers, which is a bit ironic given they're on wheels, rather than walking.
17.29 Guess who's back, back again. It's Dan Lucas. That wasn't very hard, was it? Anyway, while we were away...
- Neil Fachie and Craig Maclean produced a brilliant ride to make it 1-1 in the men's B2 sprint tandem final - England will have a finalist in squash as Peter Barker and Nick Matthew both won their quarter-finals to set up a meet in the semis - Michaela Breeze of Wales won bronze in the -58kg weightlifting, but... - England's Zoe Smith has won gold in the same competition - Oh and as I write this, Fachie and Maclean have gold for Scotland in the B2 sprint tandem final!
17.04 Heartbreak for Matt Ellis and Ieuan Evans as they look to have enough of a lead over Kennedy and Clarke in the second round of the bronze medal race, but the Australians manage to power through and nick it right on the line by mere inches.
We're going to take a break for a little while now as I'm starving. I'll bring you a roundup of everything we miss shortly, but for now here's another thing to love about Scotland.

16.54 This hopefully isn't too serious.
<noframe>Twitter: Susan Swarbrick - Cycling: Scotland's Jenny Davis has crashed in the 5th-8th place women's sprint. Currently being attended to on the track <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a></noframe>
16.47 Jess Varnish, the likeable 23-year-old, has it all to do here against the great Anna Meares. 1-0 down after an excellent first race, Varnish takes the lead and pushes Meares up but the Australian nips inside and Varnish slips a little. Meares won't be caught and it will be an all-Australian final. Meares is guaranteed a medal, meaning she will become the most successful Australian cyclist of all time.
16.42 A quick look away from the velodrome tells me India are 2-0 up at half time against Scotland in the men's hockey. Back to the main event (sorry, hockey) and Stephanie Morton will look to book her place in the final. She takes the lead at the start against Fatehah Mustapa and simply burns Mustapa off. Not even close that and Morton will race for gold tomorrow.
16.39 Apologies, the organisers rather inconsiderately decided to host the women's scratch race during my comfort break. Laura Trott, England's great medal hope... made no real impression. In the end it's an Australian-dominated race as Annette Edmonson takes gold ahead of her compatriot Amy Cure. There's a bronze for Wales though, or, more specifically, for Elinor Barker, aged just 19.
16.19 Australia's Paul Kennedy and Thomas Clarke beat the Welsh pair of Matt Ellis and Ieuan Williams in the first race of three for the bronze medal in the Para-sport tandem, before Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett, also of Australia, beat Scotland's Scotland's Neil Fachie and Craig Maclean in the first heat of the gold medal race.
16.13 I've been awfully remiss and not stuck a photo of England's triathlon win - surely the big story of the day so far - into the blog. Well here's one, as Alistair Brownlee completing a resounding victory.

16.05 Anna Meares, the Olympic champion, is going to be a hell of a challenge now for England's Jess Varnish. Varnish starts on the inside and forces Meares wide and it's so, so tight! Meares takes it by a wheel right at the death after a thrilling sprint down the home straight. 1-0 Australia.
16.03 In the first women's sprint semi-final at the velodrome, Fatehah Mustapa of Malaysia facies the heavily fancied Australian Stephanie Morton. The former dips inside and forces Morton wide, but the Australian has the speed to get around the outside and take it on the line. 1-0.
15.57 Georgios Achilleos from Cyprus has won gold in the skeet shooting, while Wales eventually lost 7-1 to Australia in the hockey. Expect everyone to lose to Australia in the hockey. In the women's 10m air rifle event, India's Apurvi Chandela takes gold and her compatriot Ayonika Paul silver. Malaysia's Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi wins the bronze medal.
Have you been wondering what our friends across the pond make of this whole thing? Of course you have! Well wonder no further, as the brilliant Last Week Tonight with John Oliver explains in this video we can't embed.. Warning: there's a bad word in there.
15.44 With this being a lull in the action, our very own Jonathan Liew fires this missive down the West Coast Mainline (and, er, then down the Victoria underground line a bit) from Glasgow to London.
Huge crowds milling outside the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome waiting to be let in for the evening's cycling. Can't help but feel it's a ploy to boost sales at the merchandise and food stalls. Worked for me: haggis balls and chips, £7, worth every deep fried penny.
By the way, if you're wondering what commentary legend Hugh Porter's up to these days, I bumped into him outside. He's commentating for the world feed, and still his effortlessly chipper self.
Jonathan even sends us his holiday snap.

15.35 My apologies, Wales v Australia is still going in the hockey. It's now 6-1 to the world number ones.
15.31 Medals in the skeet shooting. It's a bronze for England's Rory Warlow and silver for Scotland's Drew Christie.
15.26 "What's going on?" asked Marvin Gaye. Not a lot, Marvin, not a lot. Australia have beaten Wales, ranked 30 places below them in the world in hockey, 5-1, which is no great surprise. Oh and our own Oliver Brown tweets...
<noframe>Twitter: Oliver Brown - Usain Bolt, on being offered a kilt by the Scottish Sun: 'Red is not my colour.' That should please Virgin Media...</noframe>
15.10 From the BBC:

Your jokes, please.
15.05 Chris Sherrington of Scotland is guaranteed at least a silver in the judo now.
<noframe>Twitter: Jonathan Coates - Judo won 10 medals for Scotland in 2002. By tonight it will be 12 or 13. In case you were wondering why Comm Games Scotland opted for judo</noframe>
We also have a report in on England's triathlon victory, courtesy of my colleague Ben Bloom who is covering this from Glasgow rather than an office in Victoria, the lucky so & so.
The theory leading into the race was that the English quartet simply had to avoid any mishaps and victory would surely be theirs.
That logic was put to the test though, most notably by Kirsten Sweetland, who gave Canada the lead after the opening leg, and a quite brilliant bike ride from Nicky Samuels on the third for New Zealand.
Read the full report here.
14.58 So seven hours or so to go in today's liveblog and I bring you news that Usain Bolt will run in the 4x100m relay.
14.53 It's fair to say today hasn't been anywhere near as good a day as yesterday for Scotland, but their steady accumulation of medals continues. Robert Conway & Irene Edgar get silver in the Lawn Bowls - Mixed B2/B3 Pairs to take their total number of medals to 17.
Elsewhere, Wales are 3-0 down at half time to Australia, the world's number one-ranked hockey team and The Cook Islands lead Trinidad & Tobago 33-5 in the sevens.
14.37 The shooting is terrifying to watch. My screen looks like the DVD cover of a cheap thriller.

14.33 The women's individual sprint semi-finals are coming up in an hour and a half or so at the Chris Hoy Velodrome. England's Jess Varnish will face the great Anna Meares.
14.18 Here's a sight to make you all happy: Emma Ecodu of Uganda scoring at the death against Australia.

14.14 New Zealand get a penalty and the kicker Kaka (not him) boots to touch, which is met by a chorus of boos from the Ibrox crowd. That seems a little unfair. Scotland concede a free kick at the lineout and New Zealand put it out to complete the win. Scotland will be very confident after that though. Full time New Zealand 17-14 Scotland.
14.12 New Zealand are looking shattered here and are down to five men thanks to a pair of quick yellow cards. Scotland nearly butcher a chance but Lee Jones squirts under a couple of tackles and goes over! It's converted, making it Scotland 14-17 New Zealand. Minute to go.
14.09 It works though as they get up the field and Lee Jones darts over for the try after a nice switch in play by Stuart Hogg. It's converted and that makes it 17-7 to New Zealand.
14.08 Scotland actually just kicked a penalty to touch. In sevens. That won't endear them to anyone.
14.03 And that's the third on the stroke of half time. Stowers stepping, flummoxing the defence and jinking towards the referee before gliding through the gap and riding the last desperate tackle. 17-0 at the break and it looks like Scotland v Canada will be an effective knock-out match.
14.02 Stowers goes over in the corner for a brilliant second try to New Zealand. 12-0 they lead.
13.58 As New Zealand, who have never lost at the Commonwealth Games and have never lost to Scotland in either sevens or full rugby, run in the opening try, we get our first email of the day courtesy of Peter Dawe.
Some years ago, Usain Bolt incurred criticism for prematurely celebrating winning a race as being disrespectful to his opponents.. This week, we've seen Alistair Brownlee twice treat the run-in to the Triathlon finish as a triumphal progress, yet nobody says a word. Double standards?
I have to say it does sound like it. I didn't really have any problem with Bolt, nor with George North when he taunted Will Genia during the Lions series, and so I don't have any problem with this. But yeah, I agree that it does feel somewhat parochial.
13.55 That's it in the sevens: England 57-0 Sri Lanka. Now at a packed Ibrox it's the big one: New Zealand v Scotland. The hosts have 15-a-side stars Stuart Hogg and Sean Lamont in the squad.
13.50 England have passed the 40-point mark against Sri Lanka now. Elsewhere, here's the story on Mick Gault's record-equalling win.
The 60-year-old grandfather from Norfolk, competing in his sixth Games, equalled the record for Commonwealth medals in any sport by bagging an astonishing 18th podium place.
Read the full story here.
The 60-year-old grandfather from Norfolk, competing in his sixth Games, equalled the record for Commonwealth medals in any sport by bagging an astonishing 18th podium place.
13.46 That's a second gold apiece for A Brownlee and Jodie Stimpson. South Africa get silver and Australia bronze.
13.44 Sissons of New Zealand rather badly messed things up on the bike there, sitting back and probably costing his team a podium slot. Brownlee cruises home and England have won triathlon gold.
13.40 In triathlon news New Zealand have fallen right back and England have a lead of 1m 6s from Canada going into the run. Gold is theirs now.
In rugby, England have bagged four tries in the first half to lead Sri Lanka 26-0.
13.31 Brownlee's lead has been pushed up to 13 seconds in the swim, but he'll almost certainly have enough to leave the others for dead in the run. And in heartwarming news...
<noframe>Twitter: Rugby World - HUGE cheer as Uganda score! The game ends 43-5 to Australia <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23CWG2014" target="_blank">#CWG2014</a></noframe>
England v Sri Lanka is next.
13.26 This is a brilliant run from Jodie Stimpson and England's lead will be much more than I predicted. She's lapped Thompson of Scotland now and Alistair Brownlee goes into the pool with a 9-second lead.
13.22 In the rugby Australia, after being given a soft opening fixture against Sri Lanka, are now 29-0 up against Uganda. Canada, who were spanked 39-0 in the opening match by New Zealand, have beaten Barbados 68-5. New Zealand v Barbados kicks off at 8.20pm.
Meanwhile Stimpson is getting away from Samuels in the running leg and will hand over to Commonwealth & Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee with a lead of a second or two, I'll wager.
13.20 Nicky Samuels, New Zealand's third-leg athlete, has reeled in Stimpson and it's almost neck and neck as they approach the mile run. Does anyone know why the run is a mile and the rest measured in km?
13.14 Scotland have lost 71-14 to New Zealand at netball, so let's have another nice thing about Scotland: Iain Glen, who's always great.

13.09 Jodie Stimpson has now taken over from Brownlee, who gave her a 16 second lead after a great run. She goes into the water and comes out of it still 11 seconds clear.
13.03 Jonathan Brownlee makes a good break on the bike and gets a lead of 2.5s but he's reeled in and Canada are making up good time in the run, although Brownlee should get well ahead over this mile. The Scottish rider, coming in a mile behind everyone else on the bike, runs over his own foot.
12.56 After the first leg in the relay England are down in fourth place behind leaders Canada as well as Northern Ireland and New Zealand. Jonathan Brownlee makes up ground though.
12.53 Party hard, as Andrew WK said.
<noframe>Twitter: Greg Rutherford - Being in an athletes village is great until the ignorant athletes make more noise than a herd of elephants startled in a china shop.</noframe>
12.49 As I was saying, while we focussed on interviews with swimmers and the start of the triathlon, off-screen there was a moment of history as England's Mick Gault, who came out of retirement at the age of 60, equalled the record for the most ever Commonwealth Games medals by claiming bronze in the 10m air pistol shooting. Well done, him.
12.43 I have to say the BBC's coverage hasn't be brilliant, with a lot of focus on montages and video packages.
<noframe>Twitter: Carmela - They've finally run out of swimmers to talk to so we're watching other sports <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23Glasgow2014" target="_blank">#Glasgow2014</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tensporttv" target="_blank">@tensporttv</a></noframe>
12.40 My colleague Giles Mole has handily put together this story of England's heartbreaking netball defeat. Why not have a read?
The gripping Pool B tussle at the SECC venue looked to be going England's way as they led until the final quarter, but a forceful courtside pep talk from Australia coach Lisa Alexander steeled the Diamonds for a late surge.
They drew level and then traded points with England until, inside the final minute and with the tension rising, Harten failed to make her shot, which bounced off the rim to hand the initiative to the Australians.
You can read the full story here.
12.33 That's Jones's third medal of the day after she took silver in the clubs and ball events. Her team-mate also took bronze in the ball. There was also good news for Wales in the sevens as they beat Malaysia 52-0. It's not been the most competitive of starts to the rugby, you have to say.
The triathlon is underway now, with the Brownlees in action for hot favourites England.
12.25 We have a gold for Wales! Frankie Jones has beaten the odds and favourite Patrica Bezzoubenko to take first place in the ribbon event.
12.08 Quick cycling update before I go and grab some lunch.

11.58 After their spanking in the rugby earlier, Canada will be pleased that Patricia Bezzoubenko has her fourth gold medal of the games in Rhythmic gymnastics - Ball. For England, there's good news in the pool as Fran Halsall sets a new British record of 25.64 seconds in the 50m fly.
Wales have kicked off their rugby sevens campaign against Malaysia and are 19-0 to the good. Despite featuring Will Harries, once of my team Northampton Saints, I don't fancy Wales' chances of a medal at these games although they should win this match easily enough.
There was heartbreak earlier for England's netballers when Australia's Caitlin Bassett scored the winner in the dying seconds.

11.52 Tears will be washing through the valleys right now, coursing their way down to the Severn and splashing up on to the M4, cascading down to Cardiff, Swansea and Newport*: Wales have lost 3-0 to Australia at table tennis.
*My Welsh geography isn't great.
11.35 In the pool, Scotland's Hannah Miley has reached tonight's 200m breaststroke final, while England's Chris Walker-Hebborn is into the men's 50m backstroke final. Both of those will be looking to add to the gold medals they've already won this evening.
11.26 Euan Barton and Gemma Gibbons, Scotland's husband and wife judo duo, have won their respective quarter finals.
11.11 We have a tweet from Thomas Lydon, who is hoping for more British success today, I guess.
<noframe>Twitter: Thomas Lydon - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/DanLucas86" target="_blank">@DanLucas86</a> I can just about stand watching Australians winning for 80 minutes, but not 12 hours.</noframe>
I'm afraid it's finished Australia 62-7 Sri Lanka.
11.07 Sri Lanka, midway through the second half, have got the ball for the first time in the match and have in fact scored! That makes it 50-7 to Australia. Here's a shot of the New Zealand v Canada match.

11.00 England's netball players are in tears after a late 49-48 defeat.
10.56 One minute to go and it's England 48-48 Australia. Speaking of Australia, they're now playing Sri Lanka in the sevens and have scored straight from the kick-off. It's 10-0 after less than two minutes and this could be painful.
There's been a great performance for Scotland in the swimming, where Cameron Brodie finished ahead of Olympic gold medalist Chad le Clos in the heats.
It's 22-0 to Australia now in the sevens.
10.48 Who'd have thought netball would be such a physical sport? Players are being dumped all over the place in a thriller between England and Australia, with the Australians leading 43-42 with eight minutes to go.
Not so close is the rugby. New Zealand, who play the hosts at lunchtime today, are running in tries quicker than I can type and have just beaten Canada 39-0. I lost count in the end, but I think that's eight tries for NZ.
10.33 England currently hold a one-point lead ub a tense battle with Australia, while New Zealand v Canada has kicked off in the rugby and, as I write this, the favourites have just scored the opening try to take a 7-0 lead through Bryce Heem.
Meanwhile in light of some rather nasty tweets yesterday, here's thing I love about Scotland Number One.

Oh it's 12-0 to New Zealand now.
10.13 So I'll be here to guide you through the next 12 hours (gulp!) and to my mind there's one clear highlight today: the start of the rugby sevens. For those not familiar with the shortened format of the game, it's as breathless, physical, skilled and fast a sport as they come and it gets underway in 15 minutes or so. Before then, let's have a look at what's already happened today.
Veteran Mick Gault, looking for a record-equalling 18th Commonwealth Games medal has recovered from a bad start to qualify for the skeet shooting final in 5th place. The first medal of today went to Themida Christodoulidou (Cyprus) in the Rhythmic gymnastics - Individual hoop. England's Stephani Sherlock came fifth and Laura Halford of Wales was down in seventh. In the lawn bowls, Australia lead Scotland 17-11 after End 17.
09.53 Morning folks and welcome to day three of the Commonwealth Games from a glorious, sunny, lovely Glasgow. Yesterday was a great day for both England and Scotland, so let's all play nice today, yes, Twitter? Good. The action got underway early this morning, while I was still tucking into my bowl of haggis and Irn Bru Special K, so we'll waste no time. Here's what's coming up today, folks.
