Taste Test: The Best And Worst Store-Bought Spinach Dips
Here at HuffPost Taste, dip is a priority. A party isn't worth its salt if there's no dip, whether it's cheese fondue at an upscale get-together or chili cheese dog dip at a football party where your buddies paint their bare chests and hurl their bodies down a queso-covered Slip 'N Slide.
It's tough to play favorites when one has a love this deep for dip, but we can say without hesitation that we'd happily live on spinach artichoke dip alone. While it's always better homemade, there are store-bought versions that we've always wondered about. We gathered eight of the top brands for a blind taste test to put our minds at rest.
There's one thing these eight dips all have in common -- spinach. They do not, however, all contain artichoke (get your acts together, food brands!). Keeping this in mind, we corralled a group of editors to rank them. The results ranged from "Life cannot get more perfect than this" to "Thin, watery, sour. Seafoody?" We don't want you to toe this fine line uninformed, so we're sharing these ever-important results with you.
Where does your favorite rank? Let us know below!
As always, this taste test was in no way influenced by the brands included.
