World Athletics 2011: Bolt bounces back with 200m gold
Usain Bolt retains his world 200m title in Daegu with a stunning performance, setting the quickest time in the world this year, 19.40 seconds.
Bolt was disqualified from the 100m earlier in the championships after false starting but did not make the same mistake again, finishing ahead of American Walter Dix and Christophe Lemaitre from France who set a massive personal best to take bronze.
