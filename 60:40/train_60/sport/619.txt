Alastair Cook made just three runs as the England Test captain opened the batting for MCC in their match against the County Championship winners Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi.
Having top-scored in MCC's Twenty20 defeat against Sussex on Friday, Cook could not replicate the feat and was lbw to Ryan Sidebottom as his side were bowled out for 221 in their first innings.
Yorkshire's reply started strongly and they ended day one on 82 for two, with Adam Lyth, who is in the England squad for the tour of the West Indies and could partner Cook at the top of the order, hitting an unbeaten half-century. Cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not Lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call-up last week.
Sidebottom removed Nick Compton with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged to the wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.
Cook soon followed Compton before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. The pair put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch.
Daryl Mitchell (54) and Zafar Ansari (24) were the others who made it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs.
Lyth then took centre-stage as he started the Yorkshire reply, although he lost his fellow opener and captain Alex Lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of Matt Dunn for 11.
A 72-ball half-century from Lyth kept the champions ticking over until Jack Leaning was caught off Ansari late in the day - with Steven Patterson brought in as nightwatchman to see out the closing overs.
