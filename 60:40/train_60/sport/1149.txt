London 2012 Olympics: Nick Woodbridge and Sam Weale offer hope of British resurgence in modern pentathlon

Devised by Baron Pierre de Coubertin himself and making its debut at the Games exactly 100 years ago, it features fencing, swimming, horse riding, running and shooting, all in one day.
Coubertin intended it to reflect the experience of a soldier behind enemy lines during the Napoleonic Wars; contemporary viewers may regard it as a high-budget version of It’s A Knockout.
Britain, as with many sports invented elsewhere, has historically been pretty useless at it, on the men’s side at least. Not in a century of modern pentathlon has an athlete from this country won a medal of any colour in the individual men’s event, which has traditionally been dominated by eastern Europe.
On Saturday evening, though, Nick Woodbridge and Sam Weale offered hope of a resurgence, finishing a creditable 10th and 13th respectively. David Svoboda, of the Czech Republic, won gold, China's Cao Zhongrong the silver and Adam Marosi, of Hungary, bronze.
There was, predictably, a tinge of disappointment for Woodbridge especially, given that he had finished third in the test event here last year and went into the final event, the combined run and shoot, with an outside chance of a medal. But having given his all over 11 gruelling hours, the 26 year-old from Telford was entitled to feel satisfied with his performance.

The day began at a quarter to nine with the round-robin fencing competition. All the competitors faced each other in one-hit bouts, with the first score winning. The bizarre sight of 18 fights taking place every minute was redolent of a scene from that never-made French film, The Thirty-Six Musketeers. Weale and Woodbridge both won 17 and lost 18 bouts to end in joint 13th place.
Both are stronger swimmers than fencers, though, and Woodbridge moved up the leaderboard by posting the second fastest time in the 200 metres freestyle event at the Aquatic Centre.
Only Amro El Geziry beat him — in a new Olympic record — and Woodbridge’s time of 1min 57.32sec was good enough for 1,396 points and eighth place as they headed south of the river to Greenwich Park for the final two events.
For the casual viewer, the show jumping is possibly the most entertaining part of all. For some of the athletes, however, it saw four years of hard work crushed by the luck of the draw. Riders were randomly paired with horses and given only 20 minutes to practise before their round.
Organisers had pledged to avoid a repeat of Beijing four years ago, which saw dozens of refusals and several falls on a selection of clearly inexperienced mounts. But though the horses had gone through a rigorous selection process, some were clearly more able than others.
Woe betided Hwang Woo-jin, of South Korea, whose horse Shearwater Oscar threw him off and bolted before he had even started his round.
With the clock already running and his left leg injured from the fall, Hwang set off in pursuit and managed to clamber aboard, only for Shearwater Oscar then to kick over virtually every fence. There was warm applause for Hwang as he finished with 464 jumping and time penalties, but his Olympic dream was over.
Woodbridge, a skilled rider who first rode at the age of three and was a member of the Pony Club by age 12, was sitting on a kicking, ticking time-bomb called Umberto de Fauquez.
But he used all his years of experience to guide the horse around the course with just one fence dislodged and six seconds of time penalties. He was seventh going into the final event – Weale was a place behind — but Umberto de Fauquez could well have scuppered his chances for good.
Factors such as these breed lingering doubt over whether modern pentathlon will see much of its second century. It survived a crunch vote over its future in 2005, and faces another one next year, when the International Olympic Committee will cut one sport from the programme.
Swordsmanship and horsemanship are seen as increasingly anachronistic in an age when the Olympics is seeking a younger audience. Meanwhile, those spectators who purchased tickets for the entire event faced a mad dash to get from the Olympic Park to Greenwich Park in time for the start of the show jumping.
The sport has responded. Until 1992, it took place over five separate days at five separate venues. Now, the entire competition is over in a single day, and will be held in a single location for the first time at Rio 2016.
The shooting has been incorporated into the run, with laser pistols and electronic targets. The combined 3km run/shoot — which did not, unfortunately, incorporate pop-up targets appearing in windows — was handicapped based on the standings.
Runners stopped at 1km intervals, where they had to shoot five targets before continuing. Leader Svoboda went out first, with Cao just a second behind him. Woodbridge, a strong runner, lost time on both the first and second shooting ranges but rallied strongly on the final run to claim a top-10 finish.
