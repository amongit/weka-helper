European Athletics Championships 2014: Mo Farah puts marathon plans on hold until the end of his career

Mo Farah plans to return to marathon running at the end of his career despite a disappointing performance in London in April.
Many had expected Farah to challenge the world record on his marathon debut, but the 31-year-old could only manage a time of 2hr 8min 21sec as he trailed in eighth.
The double Olympic and world champion now says he has shelved marathon running to focus on the track until after the 2016 Olympics.
“Marathon is entirely different from the 5,000 metres or 10,000m,” he said. “But 2014 is a good year to try new things, as there are no World Championships or Olympics.
“[The London Marathon] was tough, and my 2-08 was not good enough. Last year I ran 3 min 28.81 sec in a 1500m race, and tackled the marathon this year – quite a switch. I was having a hard time. But you always have to try new things in life.”

While admitting there was “a lot of work to be done” before achieving marathon success, Farah also revealed: “I would like to try again towards the end of my career. Right now I am going to concentrate on the Europeans, then on the 2015 World Championships and, after that, on the Olympics in 2016.”
Farah skipped the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last month after he spent four days in hospital when he lost consciousness and collapsed at his home in America.
He says his appearance in Zurich, starting with an attempt to regain his 10,000m title at the European Championships on Wednesday evening, is a chance to save his season.
“It does feel a bit like that,” he said “But then again, I always go out to win. But maybe I just want to win a bit more badly this time.”
