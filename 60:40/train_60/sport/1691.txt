Cheetah vs. Greyhound VIDEO Shows Animals Running In Super Slow Motion
No runner -- not even the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt -- can beat a cheetah in a race. But this incredible new video from Earth Unplugged shows us that a greyhound, the world's fastest recorded canine, comes pretty close.
In the video, greyhounds Sooty and Sweep run alongside the “vampire bat mobile,” where a camera is recording in high definition. Head-on shots capture the dogs chasing a toy dragged behind the vehicle.
It's hard to miss the striking similarity between the cheetah and greyhound’s stride since both animals use a rotary gallop, and have streamlined bodies with flexible spines to lengthen their step.
So then, what exactly makes the cat beat the dog? Watch the video above to find out.
