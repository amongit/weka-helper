Gary Neville, the former Manchester United defender who is now England coach, says the Premier League has to "get over" the disruption a 2022 World Cup played in winter would cause.
On the day Fifa recommended moving the Qatar World Cup to the winter of 2022, Neville said that the negatives of a rare disruption to the European leagues, who are against move, are outweighed by the positives of taking the tournament to new frontiers.
"Disrupted for a World Cup?" he told Talksport. "You're making the World Cup sound like the Sherpa Vans Trophy. The World Cup's the World Cup, it's hardly a tin-pot competition.
"The Premier League will be disrupted for a year, every 24 or 28 years, for a continent to have a World Cup. We've got to get over it. Football's a world game."
Neville accepted there were questions over how FIFA awarded the tournament to Qatar but that the region deserved to host it.

He added: "It's been shoddy how they've got to the decision, the fact it's taken so long and been a shambles of a process. But I've been to the Middle East a number of times and they deserve a World Cup.
"It seems to have been a bit underhand and they've only decided after it's been awarded but they've got to the right place, to make allowances for a continent to host a World Cup and for them to play in normal heat."
