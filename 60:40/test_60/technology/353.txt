â€‹Brazilian ICT market to grow 5 percent in 2015
The Brazilian IT and telecommunications (ITC) market is predicted to grow by 5 percent and generate $165.6bn in 2015, according to a report released by analyst firm IDC.
Growth in the telecom industry alone will be about 80 percent higher than IT in Brazil, totaling $107bn this year with an emphasis in mobile and corporate networking services, according to IDC.
IT in schools can be a powerful tool for students in emerging nations, but we've got to think about more than just the hardware. Here, one school offers a glimpse of how tech really can make a difference.
Within IT, the main areas of investment will be mobility and cloud as a means to reduce spending. Focus on those two areas will also lead to an increase in investment in endpoint security, a market that should reach about $117m in Brazil this year.
Sales of computers, tablet devicesand smartphones should represent about 45 percent of all IT investments in Brazil during this year, so $27.5m.
Compared to previous years, industry prospects for 2015 are actually quite meagre: the ITC sector grew by 8 percent in 2014 and in 2013, it enjoyed growth of 15 percent.
According to IDC analyst Pietro Delai, industry performance will suffer in 2015 due to the volatility of the dollar in relation to the Brazilian currency, the real.
This year's forecast places Brazil as the sixth largest ITC market in the world.
