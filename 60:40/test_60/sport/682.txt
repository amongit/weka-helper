Well over 200 points scored on the final day, the title in doubt until the final few seconds of the championship - and a victory ultimately secured by just six points.
The 2015 Six Nations must surely rank as one of the most dramatic in history, but was it the best ever?
• Six Nations Super Saturday - how the day unfolded • England 55 France 35: Twickenham stunned as title goes to Ireland • Italy 20 Wales 61: George North brilliance in vain for Welsh • Scotland 10 Ireland 40: Irish eyes smiling after Murrayfield rout
The 2014 edition had plenty of drama on the final day - which also ended in an Ireland win - and the editions of 2003, 2009 and 2012 were marked by superb Grand Slam-winning sides.
But which was the best overall? Have your say here
