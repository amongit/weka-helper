Christmas World Cup is a carve-up for rich clubs

The word that defined the attitude of the big clubs to a Christmas World Cup in Qatar was “compensated". It came from Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of the European Clubs Association, and confirmed that the great leagues will agree to the travesty of 2022 so long as there is something in it for them.
The Qatar World Cup should not be moved to November and December, of course. It should be re-opened, on the grounds that the original summer bid is now invalid (it was specious from the outset), quite apart from the corruption issue. But the clubs, leagues and federations have all given up the ghost. Rather than fight a power even greater than themselves (Qatari sovereign wealth), they are grabbing a slice of the pie. They want to be “compensated".
Oh what a carve up. A shorter World Cup. A final on 23 December. No elite club football from Nov 1, probably, until January 1. A whole season turned on its head for a World Cup Fifa are calling “the most viable solution for all stakeholders,” aka the least of all evils.
Remember construction worker deaths. Remember human rights. Remember how it got there in the first place. But do not expect resistance from anyone who stands to gain from it, or those who, from a long-term Machiavellian perspective, hope to see Fifa’s credibility wrecked forever.
