Olivier Giroud gave his all for Arsenal but could not quite atone for first-leg misses at the Emirates

At the end he dropped to one knee, his hand over his face. It was impossible not to think that during those private seconds Olivier Giroud was reflecting on the opportunities he had wasted during the madness of the first leg of this Champions League tie that so fatally damaged Arsenal’s prospects.
He would also have replayed the moment – the big moment – late in the second half which could have created history. The striker reached a free-kick and steered the ball towards the goal, but he and Alexis Sánchez got in each other’s way – another case of Arsenal inflicting wounds on themselves? – and there was not enough pace on the ball to beat Danijel Subasic. Even then the goalkeeper only just beat the ball out with Giroud desperately pleading that it had crossed the line.

Fine margins. Such incredibly fine margins; as razor-sharp and defined as Giroud’s haircut. Also small differences and big mistakes – that inevitably lead to even bigger statements, ramifications and accusations.
It summed up Arsenal in this Champions League tie; it summed up Arsenal’s recent history in the competition, in which they contrive ever-more maddeningly to fail to go beyond the last 16 – although usually the official reason is that they lose on the away-goals rule. And usually they go out to stronger opposition than this.

Here they attempted to create history by overturning a deficit that had not been achieved before in the Champions League and Giroud was almost their history man.
After his tribulations of the first leg, in which he missed a host of chances and was eventually hauled off by Arsène Wenger, Giroud had spoken lyrically about football being “an everlasting new beginning”. And he is right. But not when you are 3-1 down from the first leg and away from home.
This was not just about creating history but wishing you could rewrite it. It was about searching for an improbable redemption in what was a far more probable glorious failure. The statistics showed that Arsenal had a two per cent chance. Just two per cent.

That they got so close was testimony to their will, their desire and their ability – and also an even greater indictment, in the brutal light of day that they will also now face, that they totally messed up.
There is no way that Monaco are a better side than Arsenal and that reckoning also has to be dealt with by Wenger and the club as they reflect on the bittersweet nature of failing in such courageous terms.
There was anger, too. Clearly there was. It was evident from the first whistle as Giroud showed the spiky aggression to tell the Monaco defenders that he would be dominating them and not the other way round; that he would be charging into every challenge and throwing himself at every cross.
So often Giroud has been accused of being a “flat-track bully” but here he showed that he could be a Champions League bully. This was not about Wenger applying the gloss that Giroud had shown the mentality to turn around his disappointment from the first leg with goals against the likes of Everton, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United. This was about doing it on the biggest stage in club football.

Do not doubt the strength of Giroud’s character, Wenger had said, as the 28-year-old had not long ago been playing in the third tier of French football.
After being dropped for the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United, Giroud was reinstated and charged with the responsibility of restoring pride: for Arsenal and himself.
His performance did just that. No one could question him last night. Here was an accomplished centre-forward, which made the first leg even more frustrating. That woeful performance would have wounded him. Wenger also spoke of how Giroud “owes the revenge to himself” and although he clearly also owed it to Arsenal, the manager was right. It was his elegant way of saying that Giroud had let himself down.

Giroud’s determination, veering on rage, was evident. He strained himself to head only just wide and then fought through a wall of defenders to reach the ball with his head as it rebounded around the penalty area.
And then Giroud scored the goal that fanned the smouldering belief. It came with Santi Cazorla sliding the ball into Danny Welbeck, who prodded it through for Giroud, who showed desperate determination to reach it. The ball bounced up off Subasic and off Giroud’s face but the striker had the presence and calmness to loft it high into the net. Again – where had that composure been in the first leg?
After Aaron Ramsey’s goal Arsenal needed just one more. The opportunity fell to Giroud. He could not, quite, take it, even if he did well to hit the target. Good, but not good enough. It summed up Arsenal.
