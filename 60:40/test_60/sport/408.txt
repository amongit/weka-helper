The British government scuppered Madrid’s bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games in retaliation at Spain’s hard line stance over Gibraltar, a senior Liberal Democrat claimed.
Sir Graham Watson, the MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, described how David Cameron threatened his Spanish counterpart with derailing the Madrid bid last summer amid escalating diplomatic tensions over controls imposed by Spain at its border with the British Overseas Territory.
“I am told Mr Cameron actually said to the Spanish Prime Minister, ‘if you carry on with these border queues we will make sure you don’t get the Olympic Games,’” Sir Graham said during a debate televised debate in Gibraltar ahead of the EU elections.
“And I believe that is what happened,” he added.
Sir Graham, who is President of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, said that as well as contacting Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, to lodge a formal complaint at Spain’s actions at the border Mr Cameron had sought other ways to pressurise Spain.

“He also drew up a list of things we could do to say to Spain ‘this is not right’ and as a result Madrid will not host the Olympic Games, it will go to Tokyo as a result of UK action. We need far more things like that on the list.”
Madrid reached the final three cities and competed against Tokyo and Istanbul to stage the 2020 Olympic Games but lost out in the September vote, which came during a summer of renewed tensions over the tiny territory at the foot of Spain.
A British IOC official was among those who questioned Spain’s reputation, raising the issue of doping which has tainted Spanish sport in recent years.
A spokesman for the British Government played down Sir Graham’s claim.
‘Sir Graham Watson was speaking as an MEP, not as a member of Her Majesty’s Government,” the spokesman said.
“As has always been the practice, the UK government did not favour any of the three finalists over others, and there was absolutely no UK attempt to influence any of the bids.”
