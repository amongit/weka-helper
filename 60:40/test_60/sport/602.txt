Cycling doping report: Lance Armstrong ban backed as former UCI presidents accused

Brian Cookson, the president of the UCI, warned that the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) report into doping would "find a lot of worms" and no one will feel more uncomfortable this morning than his two predecessors, Hein Verbruggen and Pat McQuaid.
The pair now stand formally accused by an independent commission of presiding over "autocratic" regimes that were complicit in creating a doping culture, frequently demonstrated a blatant disregard for the UCI's own rules, a lack of transparency, as well as highly questionable ethics.
The report stops short of finding the pair guilty of outright corruption, in particular stressing there is no evidence to support allegations that the UCI accepted payments from Lance Armstrong to cover up a positive test at the 2001 Tour de Suisse (the tests in question were found to be "suspicious" rather than positive), or to influence the 'Vrijman report' (which had been commissioned by the UCI to investigate accusations by L'Equipe in August 2005 that Armstrong tested positive for EPO during the 1999 Tour de France).
However, it does find Verbruggen — whose role as an honorary member of the IOC not to mention his honorary presidency of the UCI will surely now come under huge pressure — guilty of consistently meddling in anti-doping procedures and strategy.

Perhaps the most damning instance of complicity relates to the 1999 Tour, the first of Armstrong's seven consecutive yellow jerseys, during which the Texan produced four positive tests for banned corticosteroids only to be urged by "high-level UCI officials" to produce a backdated medical certificate to justify them.
Armstrong has since admitted that he only took the drug to enhance his performance and is on record as saying it was Verbruggen's idea to produce a backdated prescription.
"The real problem was, the sport was on life support [after the 1998 Festina drugs scandal]," Armstrong told the Daily Mail in 2013. "And Hein just said, 'This is a real problem for me, this is the knockout punch for our sport, the year after Festina, so we've got to come up with something'. So we backdated the prescription."
The CIRC says that the UCI failed to apply its own rules, adding that the incident was so serious it should have been reported to the criminal authorities and the relevant medical boards. Instead, a victorious Armstrong was hailed as cycling's saviour, and Verbruggen subsequently went out of his way to protect his star rider whose clout grew exponentially.
"The UCI leadership did not know how to differentiate between Armstrong the hero, seven-time winner of the Tour, cancer survivor, huge financial and media success and a role model for thousands of fans, from Lance Armstrong the cyclist, a member of the peloton with the same rights and obligations as any other professional cyclist," the report concludes.

McQuaid, meanwhile, is described in the report as a "weak leader" who was cherry-picked by the patron absolu Verbruggen to succeed him in 2005, in what the CIRC makes clear was a sham of an election, and who then operated under Verbruggen's "umbrella".
The Irishman is accused of various conflicts of interest during his tenure from 2005-2013 — most notably signing a contract with Russian federation president Igor Makarov in 2012 to promote cycling in Turkmenistan while he was still UCI president.
There was also McQuaid's controversial decision to fast-track Armstrong's comeback in 2009 at the Tour Down Under, despite the fact that the American had not been in the UCI testing pool for the prescribed period of time. The report confirms that McQuaid made this decision unilaterally, and on the very same day that Armstrong agreed to participate in that year's Tour of Ireland, an event for which McQuaid's brother Darach was Project Director.
"Whilst there is no direct evidence of an agreement between Lance Armstrong and Pat McQuaid, documents in the CIRC's possession show a temporal link between the two decisions," the report notes.
As expected, there is no recommendation from CIRC to reduce Armstrong's lifetime ban despite acknowledging its harshness by comparison to other riders who adopted "more or less identical doping practices".
The report appears to contradict itself on the subject of Armstrong's ban, initially saying that the need to incentivise whistleblowing and offer plea bargains trumped "the principle of equal treatment of athletes" but later admitting: "The CIRC has observed that in one well-known case, some athletes got a six months ban and another a lifetime ban for the exact same behaviour.
"Such disparity in sanction undermines athletes' confidence in the disciplinary system. To ensure equality, irrespective of an athlete's resources and his ability to defend himself, NADOs should seek consistent and proportionate sanctions within the legal framework."
