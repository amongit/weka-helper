Australian Open 2015: Serena Williams shrugs off cold to power past Dominika Cibulkova into semi-finals

A heavy cold looks to be Serena Williams’s biggest threat as she eased into the semi-finals of the Australian Open with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over last year’s runner-up, Dominika Cibulkova.
Thursday’s semi-finals in Melbourne will now pit Williams against the exciting teenager Madison Keys, who knocked out her sister Venus in this morning’s quarter-final despite suffering a thigh strain that forced a lengthy injury break in the second set.
Yet while there was drama aplenty in Keys’s victory, the quality of tennis did not suggest that she will be able to derail a healthy Serena Williams in tomorrow’s semi-final, especially as she will only have one night to rest her injured leg.
“It’s one of those things where it's probably going to hurt,” said 19-year-old Keys, after closing out her 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Venus, the woman who originally inspired her to take up tennis. “I'm probably going to have tape on it, but I'm just going to do my absolute best and enjoy the moment.”
Keys is the third 19-year-old from North America to reach the women’s semi-finals here in consecutive years, after Eugenie Bouchard in 2014 and Sloane Stephens in 2013.

Yet for all her promise – and her extraordinary hitting power, which outstrips anything else on the women’s tour – you would have to suspect that she will follow the example of her predecessors, who lost in the last four to Li Na and Victoria Azarenka respectively.
The winner of those matches went on to win the tournament on both occasions. And this time it is Serena Williams – whose steamrollering of Cibulkova suggested that she has managed to kick her recent habit of playing lethargic opening sets – that must be considered a heavy favourite for the title. The only thing that seems to have the potential to stop her is the virus that has been bugging her this week.
“I've been sick the past few days,” said Williams of her cold. “It's just getting worse and worse. I definitely have a little raspy voice. Hopefully I'll get better.”
