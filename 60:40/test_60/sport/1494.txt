Women's British Open 2011: How Yani Tseng won historic Open double
BBC Sport's Hazel Irvine and Maureen Madill look back at Yani Tseng's "majestic" winning round at Carnoustie, as she becomes only the third woman to retain the British Open title.
The Taiwanese player finished at 16 under-par to win by four shots, ahead of Brittany Lang of the United States.
At just 22 years-old, Tseng becomes the youngest player - female or male - to win five majors.
