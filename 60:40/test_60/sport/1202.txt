Manchester City are ready to step up their attempts to sign former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne by watching the player in action for Wolfsburg on Thursday.
Belgium international De Bruyne, who left Stamford Bridge for Wolfsburg in an £18m transfer in 2014, has been a driving force in the German club’s push for Champions League qualification this season.

The 23-year-old has emerged as one of the most sought after young players in Europe after relaunching his career in the Bundesliga following an unsuccessful spell at Chelsea, which saw him make just nine appearance after being signed in a £7m deal from Genk in January 2012.
And with City determined to recruit players under the age of 24 this summer in order to re-energise the club’s ageing squad, director of football Txiki Begiristain is expected to attend Wolfsburg’s Europa League clash against Inter Milan at the San Siro on Thursday to watch De Bruyne.
City, who are also watching Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Everton’s Ross Barkley, have regularly scouted De Bruyne since his move to Wolfsburg.

City captain Vincent Kompany is understood to have given De Bruyne a ringing endorsement to senior figures at the Etihad, with Begiristain, who saw De Bruyne in action against Sporting Lisbon recently, also believing he possesses the same goalscoring ability from midfielder as Frank Lampard, who will leave the club for New York City this summer.
Paris Saint-Germain will challenge City for De Bruyne, however, with the French champions identifying him as a replacement for Argentina midfielder Ezequiel Lavezzi.

But Wolfsburg, backed financially by automotive giant Volkswagen, are determined to hold onto De Bruyne, with talks already underway to secure the player to a new contract.
With Wolfsburg on course to qualify for the Champions League, the club believe playing in Europe’s premier competition could persuade De Bruyne to remain with them for at least one more season.
