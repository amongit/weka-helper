Bill Beaumont, the chairman of the Rugby Football Union, has urged England supporters to give Nigel Owens a “really warm welcome” on the Welsh referee’s first return to Twickenham since he was the target of homophobic and racist abuse at the stadium last November.
Owens told the The Daily Telegraph on Friday that he was happy for supporters to abuse him for his refereeing but not his sexuality, as England attempt to win their first Six Nations title since 2011 against France in the final game of the campaign.
Beaumont said the incident during England’s match against New Zealand, which led to two supporters being banned for two years and fined £1,000 each following an RFU investigation, had been a blip.

But the former England captain urged fans to report incidents of abusive language to any of the 360 stewards in the stands at Twickenham.

“What happened in the autumn was a minority, a blip and let’s hope it never happens again and we will do everything we can to continue to stamp out behaviour like this and encourage Twickenham to be an inclusive and friendly crowd,” Beaumont said. “So we would encourage all fans to report any abusive language and untoward behaviour.
“Of course there is friendly banter amongst the supporters and that is something that should never change But if you think at Twickenham, there are no police on site, there has been no arrests made in the stadium, none in the November Tests or Six Nations and we have had over half a million people watching the games.

“So I hope that we give Nigel a really, really warm welcome as we do to all our officials and treat him and them with the utmost respect for the referee’s decisions.”
Beaumont said he hoped the crowd at Twickenham reflected a rugby club. “The thing about rugby – whether you are on the sixth team or the first team, work behind the bar or take mini rugby – it is a game for everybody.
“The old cliché is true – any size, shape, background, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity – it doesn’t matter. Once you put that jersey on, you are all the same. And that is something I think the crowd at Twickenham reflect – a massive rugby club where everybody is accepted.”
