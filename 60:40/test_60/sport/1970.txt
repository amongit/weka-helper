Dwyane Wade Nicknames: Heat Star Dubs Himself 'Three' After Heat Win NBA Championship (VIDEO)
Unlike teammate LeBron James, Dwyane Wade has three NBA championships on his resume. He doesn't seem to want anyone to forget that.
Shortly after Miami won its second straight NBA title, Wade revealed his new nickname.
"My name is 'Three.' Not Dwyane. Alright. Thank you," he said before any questions could be asked during his postgame media availability.
When the first reporter to ask Wade a question started by referring to him as "Dwyane," the three-time champ quickly shook his head with a smile on his face and said, "No."
Maybe LeBron might like "Three" more than Wade's last nickname.
