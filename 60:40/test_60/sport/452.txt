Estonian rally driver Ott Tanak crashed in spectacular style during the WRC Rally of Mexico on Friday, when his car careered down an embankment and into a lake.
New on board footage captures the crash from the driver's perspective, showing how the two men inside had just seconds to escape before the car sank to the bottom.

Luckily both Tanak and his co-driver Raigo Molder managed to swim to safety - although they were left with the dilemma of retrieving their car in order to continue the race.
In an operation dubbed the 'raising of the Ti-Tanak', the M-Sport World Rally Team successfully retrieved the Ford Focus RS some 10 hours after it sank, and worked through the night to get the car repaired in time to rejoin the Rally on Saturday.

Despite this achievement, Tanak was later forced to retire after further problems with the car's engine.
