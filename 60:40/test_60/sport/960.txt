UCI Track Cycling World Championships 2015: Great Britain's sprinters fall short again

Not for the first time, Great Britain’s coaches were left scratching their heads, pondering how to fill the Sir Chris Hoy-sized hole in their squad.
A lightning quick track, a full house of 5,000 and a raucous atmosphere were not enough to inspire their sprinters to glory on the opening night of the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. Both Britain’s men’s and women’s sprint teams failed to progress to the medal races.
It was the men’s eighth place in qualifying, however, which was probably the bigger disappointment given it is an event in which Great Britain are the reigning Olympic champions and also given the same trio who competed here won World Cup gold in Mexico towards the end of last year.
As in Guadalajara, it was Callum Skinner who got the nod at man three on Wednesday, just edging out Kian Emadi. But unlike in Mexico, this time the 22-year-old was unable to ‘get on’. Despite the best efforts of Philip Hindes and Jason Kenny to keep him in their slipstream – Hindes tried a bigger gear than usual “to take the edge off” and Kenny said he left a “bigger gap” between himself and Hindes to “try to bring Callum on” – the Scot lost contact.
Poor Skinner, who being Scottish has had to contend with ’the new Chris Hoy’ tag for some time now. To be fair to him, even Hoy found it difficult to get on sometimes.

Kenny was phlegmatic, as is his way. “It is Callum’s first worlds,” he shrugged. “It’s disappointing but it’s not the end of the world.
“He’s got nothing to feel bad about. It’s a team event and our job is to get him round three laps as quick as possible.
“It’s difficult as we’ve got no way of telling if he’s on the back. We’re just going hell for leather on the front and kind of praying that he’s there. Unfortunately he wasn’t this time round.
“Even Chris got it wrong once or twice. It happens to the best of us.”
The women’s team of Jess Varnish and Victoria Williamson also qualified eighth fastest, with Becky James’ absence following a lengthy spell out with a knee injury continuing to be a source of frustration.
Sprint coach Jan van Eijden denied it would be a disaster for Rio 2016 if James was not able to come back at her previous level. “If you look at last year’s worlds we had all three girls, including Becky, top six in the 200m,” he argued. “They’ve got the physical attributes to be the top of the world.
It’s just making sure we get the right people at the right place at the right time.”
Great Britain will expect to claim their first medals of these championships when they go in the men’s and women’s team pursuit, and the men’s keirin.
Both pursuit teams qualified second fastest – the men behind New Zealand and the women behind Australia – but both will have high hopes of going one better in the next session.
GB’s women are unbeaten in over four years in the event, making them arguably one of the most successful teams this country has ever produced. As close as Team GB gets to a ‘banker.’
However, not only is the pressure building on the world, Olympic and European champions, the opposition is gaining on them too.
Katie Archibald, Laura Trott, Elinor Barker and Joanna Rowsell managed a 4 min 18.207 sec in qualifying – faster than they have ever been before at sea level – but still came off second best to the Australian quartet.
As for the men, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, Owain Doull and Andy Tennant clocked a very respectable 3:57.716 to go second quickest in qualifying; a far cry from their eighth place in qualifying in Colombia last year which so angered then head coach Shane Sutton.
In terms of their medal chances, GB enjoyed some good fortune with favourites Australia suffering all sorts of technical gremlins at the start of their heat – a broken crank, a puncture and a fall. After restarting, the Australians could only qualify fifth fastest, leaving the medal places wide open.
