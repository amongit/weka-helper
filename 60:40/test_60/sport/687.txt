Stuart Lancaster must have woken thinking his first proper trophy was touchable. Not a Triple Crown – his biggest prize thus far – the Cook Cup, the Hillary Shield or “the blue thing” you get for beating Argentina, but a Six Nations title, six months out from a World Cup on home soil. England’s coach reached nightfall more staggered than the kick-off times.

This was a Sevens tournament dressed up as Le Crunch, on a madcap day of 81 points in the Italy-Wales game and 50 in Scotland versus Ireland. The Six Nations saved most of its fun for the end, casting off attrition in favour of art and endless running. But after a barnburner of 12 tries and 90 points, England are still not masters of the northern hemisphere, not kings of Europe, not better than Ireland according to the Six Nations table.

Hope of a first Grand Slam since 2003 expired with the defeat in Dublin and any chance of a landslide against France disappeared when Les Bleus elected not to roll over for Les Rosbifs. But how England chased that prize. Nobody who was here will ever forget this extraordinary ding-dong of a contest, or the spirit with which England passed a half-century of points.
The old question – which France will turn up – was answered in the worst possible fashion for Lancaster’s men when a try by Ben Youngs after 90 seconds prompted a damaging French flurry. England, who needed to win by 26 points to reverse the outcomes in Rome and Edinburgh, had beaten France eight times in nine in the Six Nations here at Twickenham. But who seriously expected this unfathomable French side to play the clowns in England’s circus? Gallic idiosyncracies do not extend to helping the hated English to win silverware.
The impressive Ben Youngs opened the scoring
The whiff of a massacre after the Young try soon evaporated when George Ford missed a long penalty and the French jerked into life, striking back through tries by Sebastien Tillous-Borde and Noa Nakaitaci (this one incorrectly awarded, as the Clermont winger dropped the ball before touching it down), but missing kicks that would have heaped intolerable pressure on England. At 15-7 down, ignominy beckoned for the World Cup hosts, who lost to New Zealand and South Africa here last autumn. A climactic points chase was turning into a battle to preserve England’s credibility and stop the next six months being one long recitation of their faults.
• Six Nations Super Saturday - how the day unfolded • England 55 France 35: Twickenham stunned as title goes to Ireland • Italy 20 Wales 61: George North brilliance in vain for Welsh • Scotland 10 Ireland 40: Irish eyes smiling after Murrayfield rout
That prospect explains much of what followed: a desperate English fightback, roared on by a Twickenham crowd who have abandoned the old stuffiness and passivity in favour of the kind of patriotic fervour Lancaster has always wanted. Even before this game started there was no pessimism evident at the venue for this year’s World Cup final. The fans told themselves a win of unimaginable magnitude was a real possibility and only when France scored those two early tries did they temporarily lose heart.


Fair play to them, and their faith was rewarded, with 20 English points and a 27-15 half-time lead. This after Courtney Lawes had set off a melee with a late tackle from behind on the France stand-off, Jules Plisson, and the old animosity returned to this fixture. Rugby wise, too, it was a knock-down, drag-out saloon bar contest, with both sides counter-attacking at the gallop. There was always the sense, though, that however many points England rattled up, France would always be capable of counter-punching. So it was, when Maxime Mermoz scored the 21st try of ‘Super Saturday’ two minutes into the second period – swiftly followed by try No 22, from George Ford, via yet another superb break from Ben Young, easily England’s best player.
Why were we forced to wait so long for a day of scintillating, attacking play across all three fixtures? Because the artificial and corruption-risking policy of spreading the kick-off times forced all the contending teams to abandon caution, set-piece and set-play in favour of thrilling running rugby. Grinding up field and forcing the other lot to concede kickable penalties would not suffice. The Six Nations was coaxed out its shell and any sane observer would prefer it this way.
Prince Harry signalled his approval of a breathless game
But staggered start times remain a travesty. The teams who could not win the Six Nations determined the outcome for those who could – Italy by conceding 61 points at home to Wales, and Scotland by shipping 40 to Ireland on Edinburgh soil. Ireland put four tries past the Scots at Murrayfield and Wales ran in eight in Rome. Wales ended their shift at the Stadio Olimpico with a 20-point advantage over Ireland, but Scotland’s latest wooden spoon put the defending champions back in charge, and the heat back on England, who had been runners-up three times in a row under Lancaster.
With 20 minutes to go, there were 71 points on the board in this astonishing finale. England owned 41 of them and France 30. At the end there were 90. Yet England still needed six more points to overturn the longest of odds and France remained determined to deny them that pleasure. When the ball flew off a French boot and into the stands the air went out of Twickenham and Lancaster was forced to accept his fourth Six Nations silver medal in as many seasons.
When the inquests start they will say England squandered a brilliant second-half comeback in Cardiff with a chaotic display against a superbly-controlled Irish side in Dublin. That is where this Six Nations title was lost. This gallant effort will not obscure the pattern of England failing to win the really big games. And there is no time to correct that habit between now and the start of the World Cup.
No, Ireland are the leading lights in the northern hemisphere, as the celebratory TV images from Edinburgh showed while Lancaster sought solace from a 55-35 victory that turned out to be worthless. Seven tries against France and nothing to show for it. But hard luck stories are not much use.
