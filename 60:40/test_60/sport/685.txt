England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for their 55-35 victory over France, despite their falling six points short of Ireland’s points difference of 63 and so finishing second in the table for the fourth year in succession.
“I said to the boys at the end of the game, I've never seen such a courageous performance from a group of players,” he said. “I'm hugely proud of what that England team has shown today and throughout the championship.

“We've come up short in the end, but the mindset to play and the ability to go and keep going at a high-quality French team and score the tries that we did was a testament to the spirit and character that we've got.”
Assistant coach Andy Farrell echoed Lancaster’s praise with some concern over the mistakes that saw England concede 35 here, as well errors against Scotland and Italy that ultimately cost them the Six Nations championship.
“We're sat here disappointed because we've not won the championship by six points,” he said. “In a championship, especially the big one coming up (Rugby World Cup), every point matters. Whether it be a forward pass or a penalty along the way, throughout the competition itself, it's all crucial. Throughout the competition we were guilty of lapses of concentration for 10, 15 minutes, here, there and everywhere, especially against Italy and Scotland and ultimately it cost us.”

Farrell stressed that it was a learning experience for a young side. “That performance today. It was outstanding,” he said. “ You can't get away from that. Good and bad, but absolutely outstanding as well. The belief and the lessons learned that we'll get from that game will be second to none.
“We keep saying it – and it isn't an excuse – some of these lads have got to go through it. It's an absolute fact that the likes of George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson, they have to go through it before it comes to the competition that we know is going to be an outstanding competition here in England. It's going to blow everyone's minds and we have to feel what it's like to be under pressure and those lads have to feel it.”
Despite the win, captain Chris Robshaw cut a disappointed figure. “We are devastated,” he said. “It’s never easy to take but the way that we are playing at home we are continuing to move forwards. Questions were asked about our attack in previous tournaments but 18 tries isn’t a bad effort and that was a massive welcome for us. I was extremely proud at the final whistle, I am obviously devastated that we have once again fallen short but not many teams put 50 points on France.”
