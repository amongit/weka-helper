1. Never allow Lyoto Machida to advance on you and dictate terms. As CB Dolloway found to his chagrin in Barueri, Brazil, 62 seconds in, by body kick to TKO. Machida has suggested Luke Rockhold next. Great fight that would be... and Rockhold took little time to respond on Twitter
<noframe>Twitter: Luke Rockhold - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lyotomachidafw" target="_blank">@lyotomachidafw</a> looked good. I'm ready when you are <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danawhite" target="_blank">@danawhite</a></noframe>
2. Renan Barao still doesn't look 'himself'. He got the finish against Mitch Gagnon, but he looks less confident than in the past. But that did not stop him calling out the man who took his belt - TJ Dillashaw. "Hey @TJDillashaw, I have two gifts for you. My left hand and my right hand. I am going to shut your mouth." Not so sure about that...
3. Brazilian crowds are still 'mad for it' whatever the event.
4. Erick Silva, the welterweight, is a beast. If only he could string together a consistent run of form. Machida, Silva, Barao and Vitor Miranda won US$50k bonuses.
Don't bet against C.B. Dolloway

5. Why did the commentators talk up the performance of Patrick Cummins. This was boring 'wrestler' fighting, B level fare.
6. UFC president Dana White does not miss an event, even if he is on holiday in Namotu Island in Fiji. That's what UFCFightPass.com is all about.
7. Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson is back in the UFC. The former light-heavyweight champion will provide some well needed colour. But underlying this are contractual disputes. It will be an interesting one.

8. With this event over, it completed 503 UFC fights in 2014. We are set for even more in 2015. Too many ? Let me know. See you in the New Year - Jan 3, for Bad Blood. Jon Jones vs. Daniel Cormier is set to be a corker.
