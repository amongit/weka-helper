Chris Froome says he may not compete in Tour de France 2015

Chris Froome says his participation in next year’s Tour de France is not guaranteed, with a possible Giro d’Italia-Vuelta a España double on the cards given the parcours to La Grande Boucle, which features just 14km (8.7 miles) of solo time trialling.
Froome was a notable absentee at the official 2015 Tour route unveiling in Paris on Wednesday morning, Team Sky’s leader instead spending the day on a team-building exercise with British Sailing, bobbing about on the waters around Weymouth.
The 2013 Tour de France champion might have had a sinking feeling about the course which was being simultaneously unveiled on the other side of the Channel.
The 102nd edition of the Tour de France may ultimately prove to be a climbing-fest but it also sees the return of the cobbles that caused such pandemonium last summer, time bonuses during the first part of the race, and features the least individual time trialling of any Tour since at least 1945.
That last fact will be of particular consternation to the Kenyan-born Briton. While Froome is one of the best climbers in the world – and there are seven mountain stages next year, including five summit finishes – there is limited opportunity for the Olympic time trial bronze medallist to capitalise on one of his greatest strengths relative to his main general classification rivals Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana.

Tour de France 2015 route announced: as it happened
“There’s no two ways about it, next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains,” Froome told his official blog, which went live as the official presentation was ongoing.
“There’s very little emphasis on time trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains. With six mountaintop finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race.
“The team and I will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours I will compete in. I see myself as quite a balanced GC rider and the Giro with its inclusion of a long TT of 60km [37 miles] and tough uphill finishes will make it a well-balanced race which suits me well.
“If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back to top shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance of aiming for the win.
“In the past I’ve only targeted one grand tour each season but it could be a good opportunity for me to focus seriously on two. It’s still early days though and we’ll have to sit down and put our heads together as a team to work out what 2015 is going to look like for us.”

There is general disbelief within cycling circles that Team Sky or their sponsors could contemplate going to the Tour without him, but after two wins in the last three years it may be that Sir Dave Brailsford has other ideas.
Froome said that in the event he does go, Contador would be favourite. “You can never discount the likes of Nairo Quintana, Vincenzo Nibali and other GC contenders like Purito [Joaquim Rodríguez} and [Alejandro] Valverde,” he said. “Alberto is the guy who stands out though. He came back after his injury in an amazing way to win the Vuelta title this year and I expect him to be just as strong next season”.
As predicted, the 2015 Tour features a classics-style first week. An opening day individual time trial around Utrecht is followed by a windy-looking second stage along the Dutch coast before crossing into Belgium for stage three which finishes on top of the Mur de Huy in the Ardennes, better known as the finish of the Flèche Wallonne Classic.
The cobbles make a return on stage four, from Seraing to Cambrai, which could shake the race up if this year’s fifth stage is anything to go by. Froome crashed out on the brutal stage from Arras to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut, although he never actually made it as far as the cobbles, falling twice on slick roads having had a nasty fall the previous day.
“I actually quite enjoy the challenge of riding on the cobbles,” Froome claimed yesterday. “It’s a difficult and stressful obstacle for us to overcome when it’s part of a race like the Tour de France, but we’re all in the same boat and there’s no reason why I’d be any worse off than any of the other GC contenders.”
After three days in Brittany, which features another punchy hill finish up the Mûr-de-Bretagne and a controversial team time trial which falls outside the allotted UCI window for grand tours, the Tour heads to the Pyrenees where highlights include a first summit finish on the climb of La Pierre Saint-Martin and the inclusion of the Tourmalet on stage 11 from Pau to Cauterets.
After a few transition days, the race builds to a climax in the Alps with summit finishes at Pra-Loup, where Eddy Merckx famously lost the 1975 Tour, and La Toussuire, where Froome infamously attacked his then team leader Bradley Wiggins in 2012.
As expected the penultimate stage ends atop the iconic Alpe d’Huez, before the traditional finish on the Champs Élysées the following day which once again will be preceded by the women’s race La Course by Le Tour.
The lack of time trialling may not have gone down well with Froome but it will have pleased riders such as Nibali and Quintana, not to mention the host nation who will be praying that one of the trio of Frenchmen who vied for the podium this summer can go one better.
Jean-Christophe Péraud, runner-up this year, is not bad against the clock but his young compatriots Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet are not noted for their form against the clock. Whether Froome will be there to challenge them remains to be seen.
