Kevin Pietersen and the England and Wales Cricket Board will declare a truce when the exiled batsman meets the governing body’s new management after the World Cup.
Pietersen, who is working for the BBC in Australia, has already had telephone conversations with Colin Graves, the ECB’s chairman elect, who has overturned the decision taken by his predecessors last year to blackball Pietersen indefinitely from the England team.
Pietersen had believed his England career to be over until Graves said last month that the batsman would be considered again for selection if he returned to county cricket this season and proved his form.
He has spoken directly with Graves this week and arranged to meet him and Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, early next month when he returns from his commentating work.

The aim of the meeting will be to repair further the relationship between the ECB and its former star batsman.
Pietersen will be given no guarantees over a Test return by Graves and will not seek any. But after 18 months of open hostility between the ECB and Pietersen, both sides will welcome the fact that when Graves takes over as chairman in May, he will be open and honest about Pietersen’s England chances.
• Pietersen will do 'anything' to get back into England set-up • How KP could go from outcast to messiah • Downton must provide answers to keep his England job • Jonathan Liew's England XI for the 2019 Cricket World Cup • England player-by-player ratings from World Cup debacle
The meeting will end the ugly public relations war that has waged between a disenchanted Pietersen and the ECB and done such damage to English cricket since his controversial sacking at the end of the last Ashes tour.
Both Pietersen and the new leadership team at the ECB have realised the past has to be put to bed and neither side wins from the current situation.
Peter Moores' position is under review
The ECB’s mood is in stark contrast to that of England team managing director Paul Downton, who sacked Pietersen, when he said in December “there is no interest from our point of view in going backwards”.
Pietersen and his legal team remain locked in discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India over his Indian Premier League contract but, if and when that reaches a successful conclusion, he will open formal negotiations with Surrey over a county deal.
While Pietersen sorts out his immediate future, Harrison is conducting his review of England’s World Cup campaign. He is meeting each member of the England management and is to report to Graves next week.
It is understood there will be no immediate decisions about the future of key members of the EnglanGravesd management, with Harrison and Graves taking stock of the whole set-up before making any big calls.
Graves wants to give Pietersen a second chance
Graves does not take over as chairman until May 15 and Giles Clarke will chair his final board meeting in the first week of next month, when the World Cup will be discussed.
Clarke will not be willing to endorse the removal of any of the men he appointed, such as Downton or head coach Peter Moores, buying them more time to improve results and shore up their own standing.
Graves wants his chief executive to take his time to make the right decisions and is taking the long-term view as he begins a five-year tenure as chairman.
The stance on Pietersen has weakened Downton and James Whitaker, the national selector, who struggled this week when questioned by the BBC about Pietersen.
It came on the day Alastair Cook’s halo slipped when he criticised the ECB for his sacking him as one-day captain.

It all added to the chaos around the England team that can be doing nothing to impress the incoming bosses of the ECB.
Cook’s thinly veiled swipe at Eoin Morgan and Moores’s leadership at the World Cup after the defeats by Australia and New Zealand provided an insight into a bruised ego. Cook also stated it would be difficult for Pietersen to return to the England set-up after his book last year but he too has to strengthen his own position, particularly with a new chairman to impress. He enjoyed the complete backing of Clarke but, like all other members of the England team and management, is starting afresh on May 15.
Moores will be held to account for results and Graves will be in the West Indies for the final Test in Barbados to see at first hand the running of the England team.
Whitaker’s position is also under review, and there are concerns over his ability to handle media questions. With Moores also having difficulty in delivering his message in public with clarity it is an inability to communicate clearly in public that undermines the authority of those running the team, something unlikely to escape Harrison as he conducts his review.
Pietersen's book upset a lot of England players
According to former England captain Michael Vaughan it all adds up to a “soap opera” which Graves will clear up.
“The game needs a change, it needs someone to come in and say the past is the past and to start afresh. Graves is clearly going to do that – obviously it’s going to ruffle a few feathers but maybe that’s what they need,” said Vaughan, who knows Graves well from his time as Yorkshire chairman. “Change is sometimes difficult for people but English cricket needs it. You have to look at the way England have played for a period which has not been great. Just maybe this is a fantastic motivational tool.”
