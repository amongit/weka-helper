Full-time: Real Madrid 3 Schalke 4 (5-4 agg)
21.47 That's about all we have time for tonight - thanks for joining, see you tomorrow for Chelsea v PSG. And here's the match report from this evening.
21.36 Well, that was as unconvincing a 'win' as you're likely to see, but Real have claimed victory in the tie with that 4-3 defeat. Schalke, and Huntelaar, are so unlucky not to go through, but they deserve enormous credit for giving it such a good go. As for Real, they have plenty of work to do before the Clasico against Barcelona in 12 days time.
Full-time! Real are through by the skin of their teeth. What a game!
90+2 min Schalke force a corner...but Casillas plucks it out of the air, and that's probably that.
90 min Heart in mouth stuff for Real as Huntelaar flicks the ball to Howedes, who hits a volley low into the ground that Casillas smothers. Three minutes of time to be added on...
87 min Sane has an effort from about 25 yards, but Casillas beats it away and out of harms way.
86 min One more from Schalke and Real are out!
GOAL! Real Madrid 3 Schalke 4 (Huntelaar 84') Modric accidentally touches the ball through to the striker, and the Dutchman strides past Pepe and smashes his finish in off the bar from the edge of the box. What a finsih!
84 min Lovely stuff from Isco, who darts inside and curls an effort just wide of the post. He's been quiet tonight, but that was a touch of class.
83 min Arbeloa is replaced by Nacho for Real.
81 min Schalke make their final change, with Barnetta being replaced by Japanese right-back Uchida (you may remember him from the World Cup. Then again you may not). Barnetta's played well tonight.
78 min Schalke playing some really nice stuff here, and Sane and Meyer link up well again. Sane finds space on the byline, and his pullback is met by Neustadter on the edge of the box, but his shot is straight at Casillas.
76 min Benzema's down after clashing with Matip, and there's a temporary break in play.
74 min That's a bit better from Bale though - he cuts inside the defender and smashes a decent shot that Wellenreuther beats away.
71 min Bale incidentally is having a real shocker - he looks totally devoid of confidence, and his decision making has been consistently poor.

70 min Kroos, with that delicious technique of his, crashes a shot from around 25 yards that Wellenreuther tips over the bar. A bit of a flashy one from the keeper, but it needed saving.
69 min It's settled down a little in the last few minutes, with Schalke looking a little weary as we enter the closing stages.
66 min It's really opening up now, and Arbeloa of all people is sent clear by Bale but Wellenreuther rushes out to narrow the angle and block the full-back's shot.
65 min Sane and Meyer link up well down the right for Schalke, but the latter drags his effort wide of the post with his left foot.

64 min Ronaldo has a go from the edge of the box, but he's off balance as he hits it and the ball rolls harmlessly through to Wellenreuther.
62 min Schalke are inches away from grabbing another one, but Barnetta's fizzed cross is deflected just wide by Modric. Real are astonishingly open tonight - I know I've said that about 27 times already, but it truly is staggering.
59 min A few changes after the goal - for Real, Modric and Marcelo come on for Khedira and Coentrao, while Schalke replace Goretzka with Hoger.

GOAL! Real Madrid 3 Schalke 3 (Sane 57') The ball falls to the substitute on the edge of the box after Fuchs' corner, and the youngster curls it beautifully into the corner beyond Casillas. The Real keeper will again be disappointed to have been beaten so easily. Game on once more!
55 min Coentrao goes into the book for tugging back Barnetta.
GOAL! Real Madrid 3 Schalke 2 (Benzema 52') The French striker picks the ball up in the box from Coentrao's flicked pass, and dummies the defender and then the keeper before tapping home. He's not been great tonight, but that's a very important goal, and that must be tie over.
49 min Isco wins a corner for Real with a shot that's deflected wide, but Kroos's delivery is claimed by the young goalkeeper Wellenreuther.
47 min Schalke start the half as they finished the first, with Barnetta finding space and getting a shot off from the edge of the box that Casillas beats away.
Lauren Gallagher writes via Email: You've got to give schalke massive credit for turning up & making this a game. So many teams go to the Bernabeu & choke under the pressure of the occasion. Considering they had a two goal deficit, their ambition and belief is remarkable. Very enjoyable game for myself as a neutral.
46 min We're back underway at the Bernabeu, no changes for either side, but Modric is warming up to the delight of the home crowd...
20.40 What a brilliant half that was - Real look unbelievably exposed, with Schalke strolling through the hosts' defence time and again. Schalke will be so frustrated to have twice thrown away the lead, but credit Ronaldo for once again showing how deadly he is in front of goal, with his 40th and 41st goals of the season.
45 min That's half-time! Time to draw breath.

GOAL! Real Madrid 2 Schalke 2 (Ronaldo 45') Well he's done it again - Coentrao floats in a perfect cross and Ronaldo meets it with a bullet header from about six yards.
44 min Great save from Wellenreuther as Khedira curls in a cross-shot that looks destined for the bottom corner. Real have won their last 11 matches at home in the CL, but they are really labouring tonight.
42 min Schalke now have to keep it tight until half-time, and prey on the anxieties of the home crowd. Incidentally just before the goal, Huntelaar smashed a 25-yard volley against the crossbar, and this lead is fully deserved.
GOAL! Real Madrid 1 Schalke 2 (Huntelaar 40') Meyer fizzes a low shot from the edge of the box that Casillas can only parry straight to Huntelaar, and the Dutch striker smashes home the rebound against his old club!

39 min Crazy moment from Varane! The defender sells Casillas short with a poor back-pass that Huntelaar gets to but can't get enough pace on to score, and Pepe gets it away.
38 min Schalke look threatening again, but the ball rolls away from Huntelaar as he tries to get clear of Arbeloa. The visitors will be so frustrated to have thrown away the lead they had so quickly.
36 min Real nearly take the lead, but Ronaldo scuffs his shot on the run that then rolls agonisingly across the area but evades everyone.

40 - C. Ronaldo (40) & Messi (41) are the only two players on 40+ goals (all competitions) within the top 5 Euro Leagues this term. Aliens.
34 min Bale gets on the ball and has a couple of efforts on goal - the first is blocked by Nastasic, and the second is better, forcing Wellenreuther into a decent save.
31 min Temper, temper. Ronaldo goes into the book for a bit of a lunge on Hoger - that was a pretty reckless tackle from the Real superstar.
30 min And it gets worse for the visitors, as Choupo-Moting, who's looked threatening so far, goes off injured for the 19-year-old Leroy Sane, who comes on for his European debut.
28 min That was really tough on Schalke, but typically clinical from Ronaldo, on what must have been pretty much his first touch of the evening.
GOAL! Real Madrid 1 Schalke 1 (Ronaldo 25') A bullet header from Kroos's corner gets Real back into it, and that's his 40th goal of the season, and his 77th in Europe, one more than Lionel Messi.
23 min That was no more than the visitors deserve, and they are flooding forward looking for a second - game on!
GOAL! Real Madrid 0 Schalke 1 (Fuchs 20') Real don't cut out the cross, and Fuchs smashes an effort with his left foot from about 12 yards that Casillas can only push into his own net.
18 min This really is dreadful from Real. Meyer runs about 30 yards through the centre of the pitch completely unopposed, and the European champions are only spared going behind by another poor finish, with the Schalke winger dragging his shot wide.
15 min Now it's Huntelaar's turn to look dangerous, as he dribbles into the box before being tackled fairly unconvincingly by Kroos. Real look really weak whenever Schalke run at them.

12 min Real again all at sea, but the offside flag goes up against Choupo-Moting - a goal here for Schalke would really make things interesting, with the crowd clearly on edge after Real's poor run of form.
10 min And now it's Schalke with a really good chance - Meyer gallops away down the left and pulls it back for Choupo-Moting, but he can't control his shot which flies wide. They really need to make the most of these openings.
9 min Real very nearly take the lead but Isco's effort is blocked by Barnetta - great challenge after some woeful attempted clearences by the Schalke defenders.
6 min There definitely could be a goal in this for the visitors - Real look pretty vulnerable, as Fuchs this time finds space down the left, but his cross is overhit.
5 min Real mount their first attack of the night, as Coentrao gallops down the left before whipping in a cross that Bale can't quite get on the end of.
4 min Barnetta gets away down the right but makes a real mess of his cross - Schalke had men over there, that was a real waste.
3 min Bale's starting on the right-hand side of a front three - with Benzema in the middle, and Ronaldo nominally wide left.
1 min We're underway at the Bernabeu...
19.45 A reminder of the teams for tonight - no Draxler or Farfan for Schalke, which is a shame.
Real Madrid: Casillas; Coentrao, Varane, Pepe, Arbeloa; Khedira, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Ronaldo, Benzema. (ITV failed to just put up their team, hence just the text. Apologies for that.)

19.38 Here's a cheerier stat Schalke fans: Real Madrid have failed to score from open play in their last 201 minutes of action.
19.25 Roberto Di Matteo's reaction to those numbers:

19.20 Thank you to the Real Madrid Twitter feed for these gems, looks like a pretty daunting task facing the German team then.

Check out these interesting stats before today's game! #RealMadridvsSCH #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/y7lsESp7q5
19.15 There's been a bit too much of this in recent weeks for Ancelotti's liking - tonight would be a useful time for Ronaldo to start firing again.

19.10 And just to ram home how difficult this task, Real Madrid’s recent defensive record in the CL is pretty handy:

5 - @realmadriden have kept a clean sheet in each of their last five #UCL games, their best run in the competition since 1998. Security.
Huntelaar will be keen to impress against the side he played for in 2009:

8 - Schalke's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored 8 goals in his 20 Primera Division matches for Real Madrid (2008/09). Experience.
19.05 So, to bring you fully up to speed... Real won the first leg 2-0 three weeks ago, making them all but through to the quarter-final. And in more bad news for the German side, last season at this stage, Real won the tie 9-2 on aggregate ( 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen and 3-1 in Madrid).
A glimmer of hope though is that Real are in a bit of a spot of bother at the moment, with two losses and a draw in their last six matches, which has left them a point behind La Liga leaders Barcelona. They were beaten 1-0 by Villareal on Saturday and Gareth Bale is without a goal in his last eight matches.
Cristiano Ronaldo is also not enjoying his best spell, with ‘just’ three goals in his last seven games.
Schalke meanwhile are fifth in the Bundesliga, and have lost three and drawn one of their last five matches.
They returned to winning ways with a 3-1 win against Hoffenheim on Saturday, and welcome back Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the side, but it’s hard to see them causing an upset tonight.
18.49 And here are the teams...
Real Madrid: Casillas; Coentrao, Varane, Pepe, Arbeloa; Khedira, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Ronaldo, Benzema.
Schalke: Wellenreuther, Howedes, Matip, Nastasic, Hoger, Neustadter, Fuchs, Barnetta, Meyer, Choupo-Moting, Huntelaar
16.45 - preview Charlie Eccleshare will be in from around 19.00 to bring you all the build-up to tonight's game, which should see Real safely through to the Champions League quarter-final.
Real won the first leg 2-0 through goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo, and it would take a miracle for Roberto Di Matteo's team to turn this around.
But then again if anyone knows about Champions League miracles, it's the smiley Italian. Chelsea and 2012 anyone?
Before the start of the blog, have a read of the related articles above and the match preview below.
--- Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti says under-fire Gareth Bale will remain in the starting line-up against Schalke.
The Welsh winger has been criticised by a section of Real's fans and the local media for a dip in form, having set up just one goal and failed to score in Real's last eight matches.
But Ancelotti has no qualms about starting him in the Bernabeu clash with Schalke, which Real Madrid go into with a two-goal cushion having won the first leg 2-0 away from home.
"If I had to replace those who were not playing at their best, I would have to change the whole squad," the Italian told the Spanish media on Monday.
"The whole team needs to improve. I'm sure Bale is not happy with what he is doing and he understands that and wants to do better."
Ancelotti is confident his side can rediscover their best form, despite a disappointing draw with Villarreal and a defeat to Athletic Club in their last two games.
A shortage of goals has been Real's biggest problem, with Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo also struggling.
"I have complete confidence in them (Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo)," he said. "They have given us so much in the past and our identity is not going to change.
"There has been a general drop in form, not just of the three of them, but of the whole team.
"Right now the team is not helping our strikers much.
"We are not playing fast, we are passing the ball too much and we need to try to find the right pass to make the most of our strikers' potential."
Even so, there is now not much room for error if the Spanish giants are going to win titles in Europe or on the domestic front.
After the Schalke game, Real will host Levante this weekend before travelling to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona on March 22.
"No team can make any mistakes from now on because otherwise you compromise the campaign," he said. "There is more pressure now at this stage of the campaign.
"In the Champions League, we want to do the best we can because this is the best competition in the world.
"We did well against German opposition last season and we hope to do the same this year."
Real hammered Schalke 9-2 on aggregate at the same stage and then beat Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich en route to lifting a record 10th European cup last season.
The Spanish giants have won all of their Champions League games so far and will be bolstered by the return of midfield pair Luka Modric and Sami Khedira from injury.
Real are without injured defender Sergio Ramos.
Schalke are fifth in the Bundesliga and travel to the Spanish capital without any undue optimism.
"We've got to be realistic, and for us to go through will be very difficult," admitted midfielder Max Meyer on bundesliga.com. "We wasted the chance to put ourselves into a good position in the home leg, but we still want to give a good impression of ourselves in Madrid and get the best result possible."
Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Marco Hoger and Benedikt Howedes, who all missed Schalke's 3-1 win over Hoffenheim at the weekend, have made the trip but Kevin-Prince Boateng is unavailable through suspension.
