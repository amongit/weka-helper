15.17 It was what the Glasgow crowd wanted, especially seeing Andy Murray on their home turf for the first time since 2011. It was what Great Britain wanted, first blood in this Davis Cup tie. And here is Murray:
It was pretty special [the noise]. I was born here, so it's just very special and I'm glad I was able to play a good match and win. I think I played an extremely high level of tennis in the first two sets and wasn't able to keep it up. It was emotion at the start.
Here is how the rest of the matches look:

Thanks a lot for joining me, and good luck Great Britain!
15.12 Young 2 Murray 6* (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Murray serves for the match ... and starts with a fault. Make that a double. What a shot that is, though. Young approachs, but Murray slap it past him expertly. And then he booms down a couple more serves to give himself two match points. He only needs one. And he LOVES IT:




15.10 Young 2* Murray 5 (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Murray has his tail up now, and a stupendous top-spin lob, which Young is able to retrieve, is followed up with a wellying smash. It was nice that. And Murray breaks. Much better again in the fourth set.
Murray breaks again!
15.08 Young 2 Murray 4* (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Rasping forehand arcs in to the right-hand corner, taking him to 30-15 up, having lost the first point of the match. A sweet volley takes him to 40, but when Young comes in towards the net he is able to swat away a Murray attempted pass. When Murray's serve wins him another game the Scot shout another "CAM UN!" Two more games to victory?
15.03 Young 2* Murray 3 (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Good game that from Young. He was 0-30 down, and won the next four points, showing good character.
14.59 Young 1 Murray 3* (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Murray is moving through the gears now. He plays a backspin-heavy drop shot to make it 40-15. And he wins the next point, too.
14.55 Young 1* Murray 2 (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) The Scot wins the first point of the game, as Young shuffles one long. The American levels, but he goes in front and shouts "CAM UN!" That's more like it, Muzza. He earns a break point and takes advantage of it, forcing Young to go long. A decisive blow, he wins first blood in the fourth (and final?) set.
Murray breaks in the fourth set!
14.50 Young 1 Murray 1* (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Murray looks back in the groove now on, on his serve at least. He shows some nice, delicate touches to steam up a love game.
14.48 Young 1* Murray 0 (1-6, 1-6, 6-4) Young is now on fire. He has definitely changed up his game, using spin as more of a weapon. He has fought his way back and Murray will want to finish this as quickly as possible. He is one down in the fourth set. Murray was back in the locker room midway through that third set.
14.44 Young 6 Murray 4* (1-6, 1-6) Murray has certainly gone off the boil a little bit in this set. And he is starts to shout at himself for the first time in the afternoon. Young is really unlucky with one call. His shot - a winner - was called out, but he challenged. And it was in. But he had to replay the point, which he wins, to make it 0-30. Murray roars back with an ace, which goes before deafening shouts of encouragement. He levels at 30-30, playing a superb point. But he pushes a back-hand on the run past the baseline, and Young earns his first set point ... and another Murray mistake means he loses the set.
Young claws a set back!
14.37 Young 5* Murray 4 (1-6, 1-6) Murray tries to crack up the pressure on the Young serve, again. He pushes a forehand down the line just wide, but he scores with the next point. Another two mistakes take it to 40-15. A double fault lets Murray back in, but he goes long with the next point and Young holds.
14.34 Young 4 Murray 4* (1-6, 1-6) We are back level again, and Murray wastes no time with a love game. Big game coming up.
14.32 Young 4* Murray 3 (1-6, 1-6) Murray tries to turn up the heat on the Young serve, with the balls being four-games old, but it comes to nought. Murray shanks the first backhand, pushing for a winner, and the American has his best game of the match, to love. Bravo to him.
14.29 Young 3 Murray 3* (1-6, 1-6)
Eileen Secrest, "from the state of Virginia and a big Andy Murray fan", replies to the question above as follows:
We in the US just don't understand why there is a problem with Andy being proud to be Scottish AND proud to play for Britain. You are seeing a problem where there is none.
That's me told.
Meanwhile the man wearing dark blue levels the set at 3-3, winning to love.
14.25 Young 3* Murray 2 (1-6, 1-6) Better again from Young. He wins his third game in this set, to 15. It earns a low five from Courier.

Hallooo! #winterstaycation #scotland #roadtrip #texas #andymurray #annielennox pic.twitter.com/BHSBLjn4rR
14.22 Young 2 Murray 2* (1-6, 1-6) Easy. Murray wins another game to love. The Sterling University massive make themselves heard:

14.19 Young 2* Murray 1 (1-6, 1-6) It's the first time at the Donald Young, the American No2, has won two of his service game in a row. And we have played just over an hour. It went to deuce.

Did people really think that Andy Murray who has beaten the likes of Nadal, Djokovic & Fed would have problems with Donald Young?
14.14 Young 1 Murray 1* (1-6, 1-6) Murray wins his first service game of the third set to love. Members of the crowd get excited:
Showing their support: Great Britain fans get involved (PA)
14.12 Young 1* Murray 0 (1-6, 1-6) A decent rally first up in the third set, and just as it looks as though Young can't fail to win he shunts it into the net. Rather unsportingly the Great Britain bench start chanting "break, break, break" when their man is only 15 to the good. Young steadies himself, though, and takes it to 40-15. But again he rushes what should be a routine winner, and it's in the net. It goes to deuce. And Young wins the advantage but is wide with his next first serve. And then he punts a lazy backhand into the strings once again. Total commitment to the forwardhand wins Young the game. He is ahead for the first time in the match!
Someone has given up though:

@andy_murray putting on a clinic #DavisCup. Soon to be 1 up team GB.Next match coming up will be interesting @JamesWardtennis v @JohnIsner
14.01 Young 1 Murray 6* (1-6) (*denotes server) It's not much of a spectacle as a match-up, this, but this is superb from Murray. It's great to watch from that point of view, and it will boost the confidence of the British team. Minute 46 of the match, and Murray makes his first unforced error ... three set points up. And he cruises to the second set.
Murray is two sets up!

Get the ambulance ready for Donald Young as @andy_murray is in full attack mode #bbctennis #DavisCup
13.59 Young 1* Murray 5 (1-6) (*denotes server) Two break points for Murray now. Agaain, he only needs the one as Young finds the net. "Come on," he moans, frustratedly.
Murray breaks again!


Can we start discussing the 2nd rubber in this US-GB tie? Andy Murray cruising to the inevitable victory over Donald Young in this first one
13.57 Young 1 Murray 4* (1-6) (*denotes server) Oooh, Murray goes agonisingly close with a lob. It's just out, making it 30-15. He's digging in now, and working hard to get a foothold on the game, Donald Young. But having pulled it back to 30-30 he slaps one into the net, which sags, like the American's shoulders. Murray, with his serve coming under pressure for the first time in the afternoon, holds well. The players have a sit-down. Deserved after that game, which was possibly the longest of the match so far.

When you see @andy_murray hitting his backhand down the line so well, you wish he used it more in big matches. #DavisCup
13.52 Young 1* Murray 3 (1-6) (*denotes server) Young goes to 40-15 up with a neat smash of his own. And then wins only his second game of the match with another meaty over-header. Amazingly Young turned professional at the age of just 15, and was celebrated as the next big American superstar. Not quite happened, yet, has it? He is now 47th in the world.
13.48 Young 0 Murray 3* (1-6) (*denotes server) Jump Around pumps out of the sound system as Murray notches up his ninth game of the afternoon, in well under an hour.
13.45 Young 0* Murray 2 (1-6) (*denotes server) Blimey, this could be over in a flash. Murray romps to 40-0 up. "Game, Great Britain." Jim Courier, the American captain, is nodding encouragement, but his player will want the ground to swallow him up. A masterclass from Murray.
Murray breaks for the first time in the second set!
Meanwhile this from MKeeno:
What a thing to ask Mr Pickup. Murray is a Scot and a Brit. He is proud of our Saltire and proud to represent GB. Scotland is part of Great Britain and Team GB are lucky to have him.
It could have been so different six months ago, and Murray wanted Scottish independence, lest we forget.
13.42 Young 0 Murray 1* (1-6) (*denotes server) Donald Young has to keep his shoulders up in this best-of-five sets match. His second set doesn't get off to the best start, though, as he is aced. Young does win a good point, with a tasty volley, but soon enough the words "game, Great Britain" are heard once more, cue big cheers.
13.36 Young 1* Murray 6 (*denotes server) Better from Young. The first point of the game is the longest of the match so far. But it's won by Murray, who pushes one past Young's backhand. Ooh, that seems to have taken it out of the American, too. He crumbles for the next two points and looks shattered. Handed three break points he needs only one.
Murray wins the first set!
13.35 Young 1 Murray 5* (*denotes server) Wondrous tennis from Murray takes him to 40-0. He's too hot to handle for Young, who needs to relax. He's shooting high, wide and darn ugly. Another game to love. Murray still hasn't dropped a point on serve.
13.30 Young 1* Murray 4 (*denotes server) He's struggling, Young. He is pushing it, trying to go for winners early in the rallies, and - because he is tense - he is making mistakes. But a double-handed backhand winner down the line, to make it 30-30, will give him confidence. A good change of direction from Murray inches him ahead 30-40, but Young's crosscourt winner earns a "yep" from the Scot as it whizzes past him. Deuce. Murray wins the next point; "Advantage Great Britain." Break point, and on the second serve Murray is able to tease Young to the net, and he is able to steer it to the American's left. Two breaks. Not even a quarter of an hour played ...
Andy Murray breaks again!
13.26 Young 1 Murray 3* (*denotes server) After two net calls Murray makes it third time lucky to arrow in a first serve at 15-0. And he wins the point with another of those thumping smashes. He ticks along to 40-0 and, presented with a second serve, Young goes wide with a return and it's 3-1 Murray. The Scot is yet to drop a point on his own serve.
13.23 Young 1* Murray 2 (*denotes server) Young find his feet in his second service game ... He wins to 30, though his serve is still a little wayward. The American is on the board and the players have a breather.
13.20 Young 0 Murray 2* (*denotes server) "Easy, easy, easy," the noisy home crowd chant as their hero races to 30-0 ... and then extends it to 40, and then game to love. Four mintues played, two games won. "Come on Andy," someone says in a Krankies-esque high-pitch Scotch accent.
13.18 Young 0* Murray 1 (*denotes server) The American serves up a fault first of all, and then Murray wins the first point, with a satisfying smash, which Young has no chance of returning. The Scot's foe wins the next one, but Murray wins the next three points and breaks to 15. Mistake-free there from the world No5. Nervous from Young
Andy Murray breaks in the first game!
13.15 And we are on ... Young to serve first. The American pats back a couple of balls before the right hander serves. His new balls are not to his taste ...
13.12 The players are still knocking up, by the way. Murray is wearing a dark blue top (surprise, surprise!)
13.06 Murray comes out to an incredible sound, after Young, who was wearing his headphones ... This might be a bit of shock for the 25-year-old American, this reception. It's only his second Davis Cup match.

13.05 Here, by the way, is the Round 1 Draw:

13.03 OK, we are nearly there. The National Anthems have been played, and Andy Murray received a heck of a reaction, as you would expect with it being in Glasgow. How long before we hear this?

12.45 This is very good fun (if not too small to read):

12.25 Hello again Davis Cup fans. I'm back and ready to serve up (geddit?) some tennis action for you shortly. We are just over 30 minutes away from Andy Murray taking the court at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow ... Let's hope he is thinking about the task in hand, and not the athletics ...
<noframe>Twitter: Andy Murray - Team is ready to go... See you all out there! Good luck <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JohnsonThompson" target="_blank">@JohnsonThompson</a> in Prague watching in team room before getting warmed up..</noframe>
09.00 World number five Andy Murray is in Davis Cup action from 1pm, playing in his native Scotland for the first time since winning Wimbledon in 2013.
He will face Donald Young in the opening singles match in the first round of the Davis Cup this afternoon.
John Isner, the highest-ranked U.S. player at No20, will play James Ward in the second match at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow.
Ward will be looking to repeat his heroics in San Diego last year, when he launched a stirring comeback to beat the higher-ranked Sam Querrey in his singles rubber to help set up a 3-1 win over the Americans at the same stage.
Ward said:
I don't know what it is about the Davis Cup that brings out the best in me. It is obviously a bit different playing in a team to playing on your own. I always enjoy these weeks and some of my best results have come during these times so hopefully it happens this week.
The draw for Saturday's doubles has the top-ranked American pair of brothers Bob and Mike Bryan facing Murray's brother, Jamie, and Dominic Inglot.
The doubles pairings can be changed later, with the possibility of the Murray brothers teaming up to face the Bryans. That would be only the sixth time that brothers have been on both sides of the net in a Davis Cup doubles match.
Andy Murray said:
[Jamie and I] obviously played a bunch when we were younger together. We haven't played so much recently, but obviously it's an advantage that I know his game well and he knows mine well. I would say it's unlikely I would play the doubles on Saturday. If it's required then it would be nice to play with Jamie or Dom. They've both started the year very well, Dom has had some big wins over the Bryans this year, and Jamie's consistency over the past seven months has been very good. So whichever team we put out will have an opportunity of winning the match providing they play great tennis.
Jamie Murray warned that there is no truth to suggestions that the Bryans are looking vulnerable, adding:
They didn't win the Australian Open but they are still ranked number one in the world by a country mile and they are the best team out there just now. I am sure they know they have not started the year the way they wanted necessarily but everyone has to lose sometimes.
In Sunday's reverse singles, Murray will play Isner, and the 47th-ranked Young will face Ward.
Murray led Britain to a 3-1 win over the U.S. in the first round last year in San Diego.
The U.S. leads 11-8 overall against Britain in the oldest rivalry in Davis Cup history, dating to the first competition in 1900.
The winner in Glasgow will advance to the quarter finals against either France or Germany.
