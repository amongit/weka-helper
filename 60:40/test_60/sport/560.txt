England consider resting Liverpool quartet - but what will Premier League rivals think?

England manager Roy Hodgson is considering resting Liverpool stars over the forthcoming international break in a move that could anger rival Premier League clubs.
Hodgson names his England squad on Thursday for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley and the friendly trip to Italy at the end of the month.
Liverpool are in a four-way battle for three Champions League qualifying places ahead of a vital game against Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday.
Raheem Sterling has been playing with a knock, Daniel Sturridge missed five months of the season through injury, while Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana have been vital to manager Brendan Rodgers’ team over recent months.

With that in mind, Hodgson has discussed with his coaches whether or not he needs all four players for the Lithuania and Italy games. Even if the 67-year-old names them all in his squad, one or more could be allowed to stay behind and drop out of the Italy game.
Liverpool travel to Arsenal for a 12.45pm kick-off four days after England’s match in Turin against Italy, in a Premier League clash that is vital to both clubs’ hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.

Arsenal themselves will have players in Hodgson’s England squad, although manager Arsene Wenger has already ruled out midfielders Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain through injury.
Danny Welbeck will be in the squad, most probably alongside Theo Walcott and left-back Kieran Gibbs. Neither Walcott nor Gibbs has been starting regularly for Arsenal lately.

United, who will have captain Wayne Rooney, midfielder Michael Carrick, defender Chris Smalling and possibly Phil Jones and Ashley Young in the England squad, play Aston Villa in a 3pm kick-off on the Saturday after the Italy match. Manchester City do not play until the Monday night, against Crystal Palace.
Hodgson has previously clashed with Liverpool over the fitness of Sterling and Sturridge, and promised to listen to the concerns of Rodgers before naming his squad for the Lithuania and Italy games.
In October last year, Hodgson claimed that Sterling had told him that he was tired before the 1-0 victory over Estonia that the forward was left out of the starting line-up for, while Hodgson had been blamed for an injury Sturridge suffered in England training a month earlier.
Hodgson’s squad selection for the Lithuania and Italy games could reflect his dilemma over the Liverpool players, with Manchester United’s Young and Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse both in his thoughts.

Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason has also been under consideration, but his claims were not helped by a poor performance in front of Hodgson against United last weekend.
Spurs striker Harry Kane is poised to be handed his first senior call-up, which means Saido Berahino, who has been invited to play for Burundi, may have to be content with a place in the Under-21 squad.
Another Tottenham player, Danny Rose, is prepared to listen to an offer to play for Jamaica if he is left out of Hodgson’s squad, with Leighton Baines and Gibbs both ahead of the left-back in the England pecking order.
