New car 'like a child being born' - Sebastian Vettel
World champion Sebastian Vettel says seeing the pieces of a new car coming together is "like a child being born".
Reflecting on a record-breaking 2011 season, Formula 1's youngest-ever double world champion reveals he is ready to take "a breather" and looking forward to relaxing with family and friends over a short holiday to "forget for a while about all the stress".
