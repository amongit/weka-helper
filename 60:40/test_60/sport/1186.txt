West Brom's Craig Dawson expected to be correctly given red card as calls for video technology grow

Justice should be done on Monday when the Football Association is expected to right the wrong perpetrated by the Neil Swarbrick and rescind the red card the referee incorrectly handed out to Gareth McAuley in West Bromwich Albion's defeat at the Etihad Stadium.
It will mean that Craig Dawson, the defender who committed the foul that led to Swarbrick dismissing the wrong Albion player after 65 seconds, taking over the red card and suspension.
Mike Riley, head of referees' union the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, on Sunday joined the chorus for the use of video technology.
That argument was furthered by Tony Pulis, the Albion head coach, who wants to see managers awarded two "challenges" per game in which they can ask for replays to settle contentious decisions.
"We need to see what technology we can use to help get referees' decisions more accurate," Riley said.
"Football as a whole has to look at it. Neil had four or five elements to judge in half a second and it is that type of situation that would lend itself to technology."

Pulis said: "There are major decisions this year affecting games. And, instead of moaning about it, how can we, as a profession, improve the situation?"
Despite the controversy, there was no doubt that Manchester City were worth their win as Manuel Pellegrini's team kept the embers of their title defence alive.
A summer of reckoning undoubtedly lies in store for City's players and staff. Frank Lampard has trod this path many times in his career with Chelsea, the team most likely to supplant City as Premier League champions, and at the end of a week in which his current employers have yet again underachieved in Europe, he attempted to offer some respite to the beleaguered Chilean.
"I don't think you can ever make too many calls or judgements at this stage of the season," Lampard said. "Judgments will be made at the end of the season and that is fair enough.
"At the moment I don't think it is time to look at players and ask whether this player or that player, or the manager, will be here next year. I think it is too early for that talk. I think that will take place in the summer.

"We're not stupid. A club like Man City, same as Chelsea, when you have a design and a responsibility to be fighting at the top of the League year in, year out, I think players and managers are under pressure at all times.
"I certainly never got caught up in what might happen to the manager. I think it is irrelevant. You have to look at what you do yourself.
"I think Manuel is very calm. You can see his nature. He is a very experienced and can handle all pressures. He's got a good manner and I think it is very important as a top manager that you never look as if the pressure is getting to you and he certainly never gives us that vibe."
One positive glimmer that Pulis could take from the match was the form of the deputy goalkeeper Boaz Myhill, who will now be first-choice after news that England's Ben Foster has been ruled out for six months.
