Gareth Bale reveals the things he doesn't like about playing for Real Madrid

Gareth Bale has revealed the only thing he does not like about playing for Real Madrid is being embarrassed by his superstar teammates in training and dealing with Spanish spiders.
Bale, who has been repeatedly linked with a return to the Premier League with Manchester United, insists in the latest edition of Four Four Two magazine that he is loving life in La Liga, although he still finds “it a bit surreal” being called a Galactico.
Having found a British food section at the local supermarket that even “does baked beans”, Bale does not sound like a player who is keen to return to the hustle and bustle of English football.
But there are a few things other than the lack of PG Tips teabags that he resents about living in the Spanish capital, and the fear of humiliation at the hands of his illustrious teammates is one of them.
“The one thing you don’t want is to be on the end of a nutmeg,” said Bale. “Especially with rows of cameras. We're always getting killed out there – I just try not to let it be me.

“Whenever someone gets nutmegged, we’re all jumping and joking around. If you get ‘megged, or you go 20 passes without touching the ball, you stay in for an extra go. They’ll do anything to keep you in the middle.”
The only other problem for Bale is the number of spiders he encounters and he suffers from arachnophobia.
“Spiders….terrible,” he admitted. “I call out to somebody, anybody, to come and deal with a spider, just so I don’t have to.”
