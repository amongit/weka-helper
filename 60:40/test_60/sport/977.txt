Carl Esparza is the first women's UFC strawweight champion after getting a rear naked choke submission over Rose Namajunas.
Esparza is leaving the arena to great applause and appreciation from so many people.
Very technical performance. Worthy UFC champion.
Esparza proved any doubters that she was the leading light.

#AndNew UFC strawweight champion of the world...@CarlaEsparza1
She was relentless in attack. Totally technical fighter. This is going to be a fascinating division.
Esparza is also a dignified mixed martial artist and will be a fine role model.

10-9 Esparza
Namajunas back to kicking attacks, and Esparza weathers it, and gets the takedown, grinds and lands elbows. Back to the feet, and good straight right from RN.
RN showing a little fatigue.Trevor Wittman telling RN to pace herself. Esparza back to the grind, RN down again. From the bottom, RN trying to utilise her jiu jitsu, but Esparza being too smart. Gets full mount with under a minute and pounds away.

10-9 Esparza.
Great action, brilliant first round as they battle in their styles: Esparza the clean, counter-punching wrestler, with three takedowns, and the aggressive striking of Namajunas.

So before we get to the main event between Carla Esparza and Rose Namajunas, here's the updated results:
Charles Oliveira defeated Jeremy Stephens 30-27, 29-28, 29-28.
Jeremy Stephens: “That was terrible. He wouldn’t engage me there at the end”
Charles Oliveira: “I was training very hard for three months for this fight and he said something’s that I didn’t like and it made me only want to beat him more.
"The weight cut was going perfectly and I was on target the whole time and then something the last day happened and I just shut down.
"I’m definitely going to have to go back and reassess my cuts and look at how I do them. I understand its disrespectful to my opponent and I appreciate Jeremy still taking the fight.
"I came and struck with him despite an arm injury and I was good on the ground so it’s no doubt to me that I earned this win.”

Scenes from @palms #tuf20finale what a great venue @ufc pic.twitter.com/ksliU33wEq

The Palms is iconic for me with these TUF events...
So rushed back to The Pearl at the Palms where Jeremy Stephens is doing an incredible job of just surviving against the jiu jitsu and wrestling of Charles Oliveira. Can he turn it around?

So I just had a long interview with JoJo Calderwood who tols me she will be back in the gym on Monday. That's dedication. "It's where I'm happiest," she says. "I get withdrawal symptoms when I'm not in the gym."

The Pearl at The Palms is a great 'club' venue. Here's the view from my seat earlier in the night.

The right support for @drkneevil #tuf20finale @palms pic.twitter.com/BRVrC57oU2

There was plenty of support for Calderwood... the right type.
More comments from JoJo Calderwood:
“My game plan is to start calculated. Some people view that as being a slow starter but every fighter is different so I have to find my rhythms and recognize theirs.
"I just listened to my corner and things started to present themselves by the third round. Ham is a tough fighter so I consider this a big win.
"Getting the victory in the UFC makes me so proud but Im really happy to represent Scotland. Its tough to leave my friends and family but I knew the best competition is in the US and so I did the show and I fought tonight but my heart is in Scotland.
"I will fight wherever the UFC tells me but its always good to come home. I think fans identify with me because I represent myself and the sport well and in return I like to make the fans proud of their support.”
Aisling Daly comments:
“Up until yesterday I had a different plan to defeat Alex but things changed and I felt terrible, so you go back to what you know and what I know is jiu-jitsu.
"The reason I didn’t make weight to be honest was I had no training when we did all the media for The Ultimate Fighter and if were being really honest, the training in the house wasn’t that great so I was off for like months and months.
"Now that Im back in Ireland and training with my camp at SBG, I know the belt will be mine. Put Conor (McGregor) as the main event in Dublin, me as the co-main event and bill it as the King and Queen of Irish MMA.”
Other results/quotes:
Torres def. Magana via UD.
Tecia Torres: “This is the culmination of a lifelong dream. I first started studying Karate when I was five so this has been a long journey. Im grateful for the opportunity the UFC has given me. I think Im definitely a top 10 fighter after this performance. I mean I’ve beaten Felice Herrig, Paige Van Zant, Rose (Namajunas) and now Angela. When Rose beats Carla tonight, I think I have a really good chance to get the belt, especially since I’ve already beaten her. I’ve got a message for Dana White too. I know there is a card in Boston in January and that is only 30 minutes from where I grew up. I’d love to have the opportunity to fight on there, on FOX."
Angela Magana(not a popular lady with the crowd): “This was a dream come true although I didn’t perform when it mattered. I woke up today with nerves and I’ve never had that happen before. Maybe it was because of how many people are watching on TV, I don’t know. I just hope I impressed enough people to earn another fight in the UFC.”

"Thank you, can I just say 'hi' to my Mum. Thanks to her for taking it. It was am awesome experience. To be honest, she was a striker, so we both brought it. I like to entertain the fans," said Caldewood.
30-27, 30-27, 30-26 to Calderwood. 9-0.
The official scores are in:
The brutal blow from Calderwood's gets an 'ooooo' from the crowd. Calderwood follows up with Ham down and is looking for the back, gets mount and lands left and right hands. I have this two rounds to Calderwood, one draw. Good performance. Like to see her avoid that left, though.
With 2:28 left in the bout Calderwood has control, with Ham under constant pressure and although game, being beaten. Huge left front kick to the mush of Ham.
Spinning back kick and knees from Calderwood. Shouts of 'yes' from Scottish supporters and the voice of her coach bellowing orders - knees, elbows, sweep, sweep - they clinch and then Calderwood takes centre command of the Octagon.
Rd 3
10-9 Calderwood
Calderwood bleeding from the mouth, but a much better round, landing lower leg kicks, lead lefts and an elbow, and then gets better of the clinch game with knees and elbows as they tie up. Ham still landing the left hand, but Calderwood wins the second, and is taking over the fight.
Rd 2
10-10
Calderwood caught early by left hand counters from the southpaw, the right hand side of her face reddening, but the Scotswoman finds her mojo one minute into the round and begins to show her versatility, landing strikes and elbows and a spinning back kick. Very close round. Watch out for the that left hand, JoJo. It's the only real danger.
Rd 1
Plenty of support in here for Calderwood. Glasgow is being heard. Undefeated in 8 fights.
So here we go with JoJo Calderwood against Seo Hee Ham. Octagon walks now...
Earlier, armbar submission victory for Aisling Daly, first round. It's just a downer that she did not make weight.
Gareth A Davies will be blogging live from Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada from midnight UK time.
