1. He is named Diego after Maradona Diego Costa explained the origins of his name in his interview with Jason Burt. As Dennis Bergkamp was named after Denis Law, and John (Charles) Barnes in homage to John Charles, Costa's father, Jose de Jesus, christened his second son after the legendary Diego Maradona ... even though he was Argentinian.
“Obviously there is a big rivalry [between Brazil and Argentina] but there is a player who is a such a great player that you have to admire, you have to respect that,” says Costa junior.
Costa senior had previously called his eldest son Jair after Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning winger Jairzinho.
2. As per tradition in Brazil, his first gift from his father, Jose de Jesus, was a football "In Brazil, if you have a son, the first thing you give him is a football,” Costa laughs. “That’s the first gift – so my dad was no different. I started playing football on the streets, I grew up playing football on the streets with my friends and that’s why I was brought up the way I was. That’s the school I had – the street football."
3. He acknowledges he is "no angel" on the pitch ... and unrepentant "I’m no angel. You can see that. But every time I play I will play the same way because that’s the way I am," he says, adding that he has always been competitive – so much so that he and his brother had to play on different sides on the streets of Lagarto, where he learnt his trade.

"I have a go at defenders and they have a go at me. We argue ... Whatever happens on the pitch stays on the pitch. The worst thing was when I played against my brother. We could not play against each other because we always had a ‘beef’. So basically we had to end up playing on the same team.”
4. "I did nothing wrong" against Liverpool Touching on the stamp against Liverpool last week, which has led to a three-match ban, he still believes he was unfairly punished.

"I can go to sleep knowing that I’ve not done anything wrong, because I never meant to do that and it was not on purpose. And you can clearly see that on the video," the Chelsea forward offers.
"I’m not going to change the way I play because I got banned for a few games now."
5. He believes football has gone soft ... and that's not good "Back in the old days there used to be way more contact and a lot of things that were permitted," he says. "These days everyone is looking at it and I don’t think that is good for the game."

6. Costa is a wholly changed character away from matches "I’m a different guy off the pitch," he suggests. "On the pitch I transform myself, I really, really want to win ... I want to be competitive, I want to run all over – I want to win."
7. He revels in playing the joker in the dressing room Brazilian physio Marcelo was recently subjected to one of his pranks.
"I got together with all the lads, with Filipe Luis, with Willian, with Ramires ... We were in a hotel and the physio was not in his room as he was working with the players. I managed to get hold of his [room] card, opened his room …” And turned it upside down.
“I’ve always been that way, that’s the way I am,” he says. “I don’t do things for people to think that I am funny, that’s really the way I am. It comes naturally. I’ve always liked to joke with every club I’ve been in with all my team-mates because it’s where we work and we spend a lot of time together, more time than even with your family. So I do like to joke around."
8. He wouldn't pull a prank on Jose Mourinho, though... "Obviously I couldn’t do anything to get back at Mourinho, because he’s the manager," Costa says.
9. At 15 didn't want to pursue a career in football “I left my home town when I was 15 and I went to Sao Paulo and went to work for my uncle [Jarminho] at his store. Basically I did not want to play football any more. I wanted to earn my own money and support myself and not depend on my parents anymore," he reveals.

10. His uncle – who could play a bit – helped him with his first break in football "My uncle was also very passionate about football. He was a great player, he never played professionally, but he was a great player and at the store in Sao Paulo a lot of people used to come by," he says. "People like agents, people involved in the football environment.
"And he would say ‘I’ve got a nephew, he’s a great player, you have to see him’. So I ended up going to a team in Sao Paulo for some trials and I passed, I made the team and that is where it all started.”
11. Costa is always holidaying in his home town, Lagarto “It’s a little town up north, close to Salvador, close to Bahia,” Costa explains. “It’s small and I’m very proud of my hometown. The weather is nice and I love going back there. Every time I have a holiday, I will go there. It’s where my family still live, where they are based and I enjoy, very much, going back there.”
