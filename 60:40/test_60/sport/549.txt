A sea of red and yellow filled the streets of Madrid on Monday evening as the Spanish team returned home for a lap of the capital and a party with thousands of fans near the central fountain of Cibeles, the scene of euphoric celebrations on Sunday that stretched into the early hours.
A 4-0 drubbing of Italy saw Spain retain their European Championship title, underlining the country's dominance of the football stage after winning the World Cup in South Africa two years ago.
After they handed a La Roja red shirt to the Spanish King Juan Carlos I at a royal welcome ceremony, the jubliant team embarked on a victory parade which culminated in mass celebrations in the Cibeles Square, the traditional location for Real Madrid festivities.
