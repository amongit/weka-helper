Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hil has become a mother after giving birth to a baby boy named Reggie Ennis-Hill.
The 28-year-old athlete told fans she had given birth via Twitter on Friday and included a picture of the newborn.

When she announced her pregnancy in January, she admitted it was “very unexpected” and had “completely turned upside down” her plans for 2014.
She will be missing this summer’s Commonwealth Games but has said she is determined to win Olympic gold again as a mother.
“I am 100 per cent set on returning to full-time athletics once our baby is born and go for a second gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016," she said in January.
Ennis-Hill was the golden girl of the Olympic Games in London when she won the heptathlon gold medal.
She also broke her own British heptathlon record with a score of 6,955 points.
