1. Denmark 3 England 4 Sept 20, 1978: Euro 80 qualifier
This is England’s most madcap match of the colour television era – the only time since 1966 that both sides have scored at least three goals in an England game. Don Howe, the England assistant coach, called it one of the greatest internationals he'd ever seen.

Danish football was still an amateur game at the time, and the match had an almost Corinthian feel, with a stream of chances. Kevin Keegan put England 2-0 up early on. Allan Simonsen, the European Footballer of the Year, and a fine strike from Ajax's Frank Arnesen - "Brilliant goal! Oh it's a brilliant goal!" said the commentator Barry Davies on the BBC - made it 2-2 after only 28 minutes.
Bob Latchford put England ahead with a handball goal after half-time, and Phil Neal punished a wretched throw from the goalkeeper to make it 4-2. A defiant strike from the Danish sweeper and captain, Per Rontved, gave Denmark hope with four minutes to go, but England held on to win a joyously absurd and unexpectedly close match.

2. Denmark 2 England 2 Sept 22, 1982: Euro 84 qualifier
A draw that left both teams happy yet wondering what might have been. Even though they were much the better side Denmark were simply happy to draw the mighty England, especially as it needed a glorious last-minute equaliser from Jesper Olsen to get them a point.

England, in Bobby Robson's first match as manager, knew they have been outplayed yet had led for all bar 18 minutes of the match thanks to two Trevor Francis goals. “It would have been a travesty of justice if we had won,’ said Robson. ‘Denmark were brilliant. I did not see many better teams in the World Cup. We were overrun in midfield by a team who did not have a single bad player. Peter Shilton played marvellously. It was as if they had twelve to our eleven. The draw was a bloody good result and we should be grateful for it.”
The media disagreed, with ignorant headlines such as RUBBISH and ENGLAND'S SHAME. Denmark, it's true, habitually finished bottom of qualifying groups in those days, but the manner in which they battered England showed that a serious team was emerging. In fact they would become one of the great sides of the decade: the team of Michael Laudrup, Preben Elkjaer, Allan Simonsen, Morten Olsen and the rest charmed the world with their intrepid attacking football.
It all started when the other Olsen, Jesper, swerved thrillingly through the England defence in Copenhagen. It changed his life and set Danish football on a different path; after a legendary 1-0 win at Wembley a year later, they qualified for Euro 84 ahead of England and came within a penalty shoot-out of the final.

3. England 1-0 Denmark March 9, 1994 : Friendly
A 1-0 win does not leap off the page, yet the manner in which England played during their first match under Terry Venables made it abundantly clear they were onto something good. In 90 minutes it felt like English football had emerged from the dark ages. It set the tone for a two-and-a-half years under Venables in which, while far from perfect, England played with a modern, sophisticated type of football that it was impossible not to admire.

England, using Venables' Christmas Tree formation, they outplayed the European champions, whose side included Peter Schmeichel and the Laudrup brothers, and should have scored more than just David Platt's excellent early goal.
The recall of the 33-year-old Peter Beardsley, after three years out, symbolised the return to a passing game, while there was hope for the future in the selection of three debutants: Darren Anderson and Graeme Le Saux, and Matthew Le Tissier came on as substitute. Anderton and Le Saux became Venables favourites; Le Tissier, even though by far the best years of his club career coincided with Venables' reign, barely figured again. It was one of the few things Venables got wrong throughout his time as England manager.

4. England 3 Denmark 0 June 15, 2002: World Cup second round
This is one of only two knock-out games that England have won at a major tournament since Euro 96. It came with surprising ease against a strong Denmark side who were arguably the team of the first round, during which they eliminated the holders France and played some slick attacking football. Yet when they met England they were out of the match by half-time.

Thomas Sorensen bundled Rio Ferdinand's header into his own net, Michael Owen finished calmly after a flick from Nicky Butt – this was the same week in which Pele named Butt as the greatest player in the history of football – and Emile Heskey rattled a third through Sorensen after 44 minutes. Robbie Fowler, a half-time substitute, played his last game for England at the age of 27.

5. Denmark 4 England 1 Aug 17, 2005: Friendly
England equalled their heaviest defeat for 41 years in a match that was a disaster for David James.

He came on as a substitute at half-time and had such a nightmare that he was picked only one in the next two-and-a-half years. A ridiculous charge from his own area led to the first of three goals in seven minutes from Dennis Rommedahl, Jon Dahl Tomasson and Michael Gravgaard. Wayne Rooney's late goal was barely a consolation, even more so when Soren Larsen added an even later fourth.
