The GOP's National Victory Is an Opportunity for Real Reform - US News
The election was just a week ago. In every race but a few, the ballots have been counted, the winners declared, and the Democrats are still sweeping up the debris and picking up carcasses off the floor.
Not since 1974 – when a Watergate-weary nation almost tossed the Republican Party into history’s ashcan has an American political party been beaten so badly. The Democrats were not just defeated so much as they were decimated.
Below the headlines you may not have read that the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party lost his seat in the state legislature to a Republican. Or that Wendy Davis, the Democrat running for governor of Texas, will see herself succeeded in the state Senate by a member of the GOP’s tea party wing. Or that the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate from the South since Reconstruction ended is a Republican from South Carolina – where, by the way that whole “secession” business started – who led the statewide GOP ticket, running ahead of both the governor and the state’s other U.S. senator.

The people of New Mexico gave the Republicans the majority in the state House of Representatives for the first time since 1952. Or that the Republicans won all seven of Nevada’s statewide offices and control of the state legislature for perhaps the first time ever. Or that, thanks to a party switcher in an otherwise tied state Senate, the Republicans lead in both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature for the first time in decades and occupy all but one of the slots in its congressional delegation.
Barack Obama, meanwhile, becomes the first president since Woodrow ("He kept us out of war?") Wilson to see his party lose control of the House in one election and the Senate in another.
Conservative Republicans who the media pundits said probably wouldn’t (and liberals said shouldn’t) win, such as embattled Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, tough as nails Maine Gov. Paul LePage and Maryland’s Larry Hogan, all won. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a race many Democrats said would go down to the wire, won so handily that the race was called just moments after the polls closed.
In Georgia, where the polls in the race for governor and U.S. Senate were so close that most everyone expected both races to go to a runoff, the Republican candidates easily cleared the 50 percent benchmark needed for victory. And Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who for the moment has the leading claim on the title of “America’s reformer”, won a second term (and his third election in four years having earlier had to fight off a union-led recall) with just under 1.3 million (or 52 percent) of the votes cast.

As cheerful as things are for the GOP at the federal level, at the state level the Democratic Party is almost nonexistent. According to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group which the left has tried for the last several years to destroy but now seeks to emulate because of its effectiveness, with 6,057 state legislative seats, which comprise two-thirds of the total of state lawmakers across the nation, up for election, the number of Republican-controlled legislatures increased from 26 to 30 while the number of Democrat-controlled legislatures decreased from 18 to 11 and the number where control is split, because of GOP advances, increased from five to eight.
In such victories, however, a great danger lies. Common sense can give way to hubris, as we all saw after Obama was first elected president in 2008. Republicans can and should learn from his example that it is not enough to say “I won” and expect all debate to end. Having won an amazing national majority, the largest since the 1920s, the GOP is now totally responsible for “governing,” a word that – to most conservatives – is a symbolic clarion call that just over the horizon lies a dangerous sell out.
It would be nice to believe the Progressive Era that began with Wilson in 1912 has finally ended under Obama after almost exactly one hundred years. They would make nice historical bookends – the last truly racist president on one end and the first post-racial president on the other – but it is highly unlikely. The water of American democracy boils slowly. The GOP did not win so much as Obama and the Democrats lost because the president’s vote didn’t go to the polls.

Moving forward – if the GOP wants to retain power and regain the White House in 2016 – it needs to focus on reform and on doing the people’s business. Now is not the time to lead with half-measures and to satisfy the pent-up desires of corporate insiders. It is a time, especially at the state level, to be bold like Walker, like Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, like re-elected Florida Gov. Rick Scott and outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, to change the education system, reorganize government and, most of all, propose and enact policies that get the economy going, create jobs and lead eventually to an increase in wages for working Americans.
It may be, in Washington especially, that compromise will be necessary to get the country started down the right road. It has a long way to go, so anything that moves things in the right direction is progress. It is not – and indeed may never be – the time to find the next hill to die on. It’s time to win, all at once where possible and in increments where necessary. A national majority this size is a gift, perhaps a once in a lifetime gift, that should not be squandered following a decision to paint in pale pastels rather than the "bold colors" that Ronald Reagan – the most successful president of the second half of the 20th century – advised.
