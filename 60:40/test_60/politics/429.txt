Wake Up, Mr. President! You Are the Lindsay Lohan of the Oval Office!
Mr. President -- I'm a big fan but you are suffering from the same mental disease as Lindsay Lohan -- DENIAL!
While virtually the entire Western hemisphere was convinced that Lindsay Lohan was an addict, she stubbornly insisted for years and through endless episodes of partying, DUIs and rehabs, that she had no problem at all. That's called denial with a capital D!
Well, after two years in office, a crippling recession and massive unemployment, you still think that a depressed and discouraged nation should somehow see that you and the Democrats have done a great job in office?
DENIAL! Are you so out of touch in the White House/Washington bubble that you really can't grasp that when millions of people are hurting -- they don't behave rationally.
They won't applaud lofty legislature accomplishments like health care or big money programs like the stimulus package, when their lives have just kept getting lousier and lousier.
You told New York Times writer Peter Baker, in a recent interview, that you were "going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular."
By that, I believe you meant that you were determined to get health care reform passed, because millions of Americans were desperate for insurance, which they were, and that you would escalate the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban.
Personally, I applaud your persistance on a national healthcare plan and I'm thrilled that we now have it BUT your big mistake, Mr. President, is that ALL your attention appeared to be hijacked by healthcare and you forgot to have a LASER-SHARP focus as well on JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Like Lindsay Lohan you've been in denial about what people have been and are still are MOST obsessed about -- it's the economy and jobs, stupid!
