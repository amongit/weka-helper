Pentagon Selects a New Air Force One
A new Air Force One is on the way.
Pentagon officials have chosen another Boeing 747 to replace the current jumbo jet that the president uses as his official aircraft, probably the most recognizable plane in the world.

"The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States [that] when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission," said Air Force Secretary Deborah James in a news release. The contract must still be negotiated. The cost was not disclosed but the Wall Street Journal estimated that the pricetag could be $1.65 billion for two replacement 747s.
The current four-engine 747 and its backup are 25 years old, and Air Force officials consider the aircraft's normal life span to be 30 years. The new planes – a primary and a backup – are supposed to be ready in five years, James said.
James added that the new jets are needed for several reasons, including "parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased down times for maintenance."
Air Force One, with its distinctive blue and white color scheme and its majestic appearance, has become an international symbol of the United States, the presidency and America's technological prowess.
As I point out in my book, "Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes," the American presidency would be a far different institution if not for the global reach that Air Force One has provided.

The plane, then a 707, transported Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in February 1972 and to the Soviet Union in May 1972. In the 1980s, it took Ronald Reagan to his superpower summit meetings with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva, Reykjavik and Moscow. Air Force One, as a 747, carried Bill Clinton on 133 foreign trips during eight years, one of the highest numbers of international visits for any president. It hopscotched George W. Bush safely from one secure location to another in the hours after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. And today, it takes Barack Obama from one corner of the world to another, such as his trip to India and Saudi Arabia during the past week.

"Air Force One" is not the name for a specific aircraft but the military designation for the Air Force plane that the president happens to be on. If it's a small executive style jet in the government fleet, then that plane becomes Air Force One. The president usually travels on the 747.
Presidents consider it one of the best perquisites of office. For them, it's like traveling in a first-class hotel suite with all the amenities they could want. Air Force One contains a special suite for the president in the nose of the plane, a spacious office, a shower, a medical facility where surgery can be performed and where medicines are stocked, several conference rooms, and cabins for the staff, the Secret Service and a small contingent from the media.
Air traffic controllers clear the president's path wherever he flies, and it's very rare that he has to wait to take off or land.
The current presidential 747s were designed in many special ways for the president's use, such as by installing ultra-sophisticated communications and security systems. This will continue with the new planes.
