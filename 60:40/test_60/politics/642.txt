Americans Don't Know What Causes Cancer
Alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise and poor diets have all been shown to increase the risk of cancer â€“ but few Americans realize this, according to a new survey published Wednesday to mark World Cancer Day.
Instead, people tend to blame risk factors for cancer on food additives, genetically modified foods, stress and beef hormones. Falsely identifying risk factors means many American do not know there are lifestyle changes they can make to help lower the possibility that they might get cancer.
The Cancer Risk Awareness Survey, released Wednesday by the American Institute for Cancer Research, has been conducted periodically since 2001, asking participants to select factors that they believe have a significant effect on whether the average person develops cancer.
"Instead of focusing on factors that you can't always control, we want Americans to learn more about the factors that you can and do control, every day," Alice Bender, the organization's associate director of nutrition programs, said in a statement.
The survey found that 17 percent of Americans believe the myth that there is nothing they can do to change their risk of getting cancer. The reality is that genes and family history account for 5 percent to 10 percent of all cancers, a reality that 21 percent of Americans know.

Among the results showed that fewer than half of Americans know some of the real risks of cancer:
The vast majority of Americans did correctly identify other factors that are known to cause cancer:

Other factors that Americans think impact cancer risks are those that research has yet to show conclusive evidence:
Bender concluded in a statement that Americans often are hit with individual studies of risk factors, not seeing the overall scientific consensus. "When it comes to cancer, there are no guarantees," she said in the statement. "But the science on lowering cancer risk has never been clearer."

A corresponding study by the organization, also released Wednesday, estimated that a third of the most common cancers in the U.S. could be prevented if Americans moved more, weighed less and ate more healthfully. This number represents 340,000 cases, according to the organization.
In addition, if Americans avoided the sun more, then nearly half of cancers in the country would be prevented, according to the research group.
The data comes as February marks Cancer Prevention Month.
