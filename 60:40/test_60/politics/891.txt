Poll: Good News/Bad News for Pols on Immigration
There's good news and bad news for both President Barack Obama and opposition Republicans in a new CNN/ORC poll on immigration.
Fifty percent of Americans support Obama's new policy of stopping the deportation of millions of undocumented parents of children born in the United States. Twenty-six percent oppose the policy for going too far and 22 percent say it doesn't go far enough.
But only 41 percent support the way Obama is implementing his policy--by executive action that bypasses Congress. Fifty-six percent oppose this unilateral method.

CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said it is "a classic case of good news/bad news for both the president and the Republicans in Congress,"who oppose his executive action and will control both the House and Senate starting in January.
Sixty percent say the Republicans should not challenge Obama's executive action in court. And 76 percent want the Republicans to focus on passing immigration reform legislation, which Obama is also calling for.
The poll, released Wednesday, found that 75 percent of Americans say they feel sympathetic toward undocumented immigrants and their families, an increase from 67 percent in 2011 and 52 percent in 2010.
