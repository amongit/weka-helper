Delhi elections: Shazia more beautiful, better suited than Bedi for CM post, says Markandey Katju
New Delhi: Former Press Council of India chairman Markandey Katju has sparked another row by apparently making a sexist comment involving BJP's chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi and recently-joined leader Shazia Ilmi.
In two successive tweets Katju said, "I regard Shazia Ilmi much more beautiful than Kiran Bedi. If Shazia had been made their C.M. candidate BJP wud have definitely won the Delhi elections....People vote for beautiful faces, as in Croatia. Even a person like me who does not vote wud have voted for Shazia."
However, Katju later backtracked and said that his tweet was meant to be a joke and those angered should develop a sense of humour. "Some people objected to my last tweet. My response is: develop a sense of humour. The tweet was in lighter vein,& shud be construed as such," he tweeted.
But in his blog he defended his earlier statement. He wrote, "What is wrong with some of you people? Can't an old man like me admire a beautiful woman? By admiring a beautiful flower I am not plucking it, and by admiring a beautiful garden from a distance I am not tresspassing onto it. Similarly, if I admire a beautiful woman I am not misbehaving with her, or taking liberties with her."
