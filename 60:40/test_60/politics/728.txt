Quel Dommage, Obama
The rock star missed the magnificent hour in Paris.
The United States did not march in solidarity on the world stage, in a gathering that drew more than 1.5 million people in the City of Lights to protest recent terrorist attacks against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.
President Barack Obama judged he had better things to do than lend a little love to France, a shattered nation. It was an hour of grief where French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron joined together as friends, not just allies.

Quel dommage.
In general, people remember who remember them in a time of sorrow. We were represented by an ambassador, but the Obama White House admits it missed the mark and should have sent someone with a "higher profile."
The urbane secretary of state, John Kerry, would have been great, but he was tied up in India. Where was Joe Biden in a vice presidential pinch? Better yet, new Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who grew up in New York and Paris, would have hit perfect pitch. And help me understand why Attorney General Eric Holder didn't go â€“ he was in Paris but missing in action at the march. Isn't he on the front lines in fighting terrorism?

Fate deals few chances to shine as a statesman. And crisis is often a time to seize an opening in old blockades and fixed ideas. A coming-together like that is a wonderful way to befriend enemies and buttress friends. I speak not in anger, like CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who declared he was "ashamed" at the weak American presence. But I am mindful of a lost opportunity.
The extraordinary live-streaming street event drew Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who came to Paris to lock hands with other Western leaders and march for an end to terrorism and anti-Semitism. So did Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. See, Obama missed a historic chance to be on the same side as these two bitter foes and perhaps break open a new dialogue on Middle East peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

And dare I add, the president only has two years left! He can't afford to miss statements that resonate across borders and peoples. He knew that in his younger days. The want of a warm human touch, however, has become Obama's Achilles heel over the years. At least, he could have bonded with Hollande, Cameron and Merkel, who's probably still sore that we eavesdropped on her phone calls.
Symbolic, sweeping gestures are more important than ever, for it's the first time the president is walking alone without winter wear: dealing with an all-Republican Congress in frigid political weather. Both houses of Congress are hostile and in a hurry to show it. The House has already passed a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline that Obama opposes and threatens to veto. In fact, the Senate voted to advance the bill yesterday.
If you're in the Oval Office, that's not a good way to show your brand in 2015, not compared to marching on the streets of Paris. The exhilaration of "liberty, equality, fraternity" would be a fitting sequel to opening up ties to Cuba. Rock stars need world stages when there's spare support on the home front.
