Ta-Nehisi Coates Makes a Solid Case for Reparations - US News
Author and national correspondent Ta-Nehisi Coates is making a major pitch in a front cover story for The Atlantic, and he is not stopping there in stirring up a public debate on reparations to African-American families whose ancestors suffered under the yoke of slavery and Jim Crow oppression. He rightly says that to have a venerable magazine (founded in the furious prelude to the Civil War) take the idea seriously enough to give it a full treatment, well, that's something that could be the start of something.
In an elegant argument, Coates has noted that Germany made reparations to Holocaust survivors and their families, a point which resonated in the beautiful old synagogue where people gathered to hear his case. He also told readers and listeners that the grand congressman from Detroit, John Conyers Jr., has repeatedly introduced a bill "calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for 'appropriate remedies.'” For now, its political viability probably has no "traction," as we like to say around here. Looking back to the Lincoln Memorial gathering in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of a "promissory note" that the March on Washington was ready to collect. What did he mean?
Coates, 38, has taken the generational mantle and added layers of complexity to the case for government reparations to families with slavery's scars on their history. Long ago, as part of the Civil War settlement, there was a chorus for "40 acres and a mule" owed (figuratively) to an agrarian people enslaved and freed, starting a new life with often nothing but the dusty clothes on their back. That never happened in the rough and tumble after Abraham Lincoln's blood was shed; the president became the bitter war's final casualty. General Robert E. Lee, the West Pointer who prolonged the war by refusing to surrender on the field when the cause was truly lost, lived out his days peacefully as a college president. As one of the wealthiest slaveowners in Virginia, the embellished Lee had no problem with our "peculiar institution."

Coates challenges readers to see in relentless detail that hardship hardly ever stopped for formerly enslaved people once Reconstruction ended only a decade after the war's final act in 1865. Indeed, voting, schooling, housing, law enforcement and economic systems of discrimination flourished apace well into the 1960s, especially in the South, as we vaguely know. But Coates underscores that blacks experienced oppression in Chicago, the city author Nicholas Lemann called "The Promised Land" for the mass black migration that flowed there from the Deep South after World War II.
In other words, some reasons for racial reparations are within living memory, not buried under the ground. He also reminds us that collective memories of misery should never be buried, such as the desperate and doomed souls who went from slave ships on the Middle Passage to brutal markets on the Chesapeake Bay and other Atlantic ports in colonial and antebellum times. The traces left behind are scarce. From 1790 to 1860, the official census taken every 10 years listed the number of slaves on a given property, and possibly their occupations (such as waterman or cook) but did not record their names.
The anguished American history on race is not as black and white as crossing the Mason-Dixon line (as Frederick Douglass did on a train) or the Ohio River to escape bondage. By 1900, the northern and midwestern states thought the Civil War was pretty well over, because they had won. Old Union soldiers "reconciled" with their former Confederate counterparts on great battlefields like Gettysburg. But in the South, where (as William Faulkner said) the past is never past, old ghosts and grudges were hardly laid to rest. Their alternate narrative of the war told in white family storytelling on porches and at table was going full speed. In the Southern stubborn refusal to truly surrender, the powers that be took reconciliation for vindication and systematically put in place new ways and means to put black people "in their place." That place was poverty, an inescapable fate for untold thousands of Georgia and Mississippi families who struggled to get by as sharecroppers.
To preserve white privilege and hegemony, segregation was the next best thing, to put it bluntly. Lynchings, originally the Ku Klux Klan's way of terrorizing black communities, still took place in Southern states as far north as Maryland into the 1930s. In recent years, another strain of white storytelling, popularized by author Jay Winik, suggests how lucky we are that the Confederacy conceded in valorous tones set by General Robert E. Lee and didn't splinter into factions. Actually, we have little to thank Lee for. Lincoln felt the same; he dispossessed the Lee family from their plush slave plantation, Arlington, as war broke out in 1861.

Coates filled the hall at Washington's Sixth and I historic synagogue, the venue in vogue for the latest intellectual ideas. The throng was mostly under 40. In an interview format with Atlantic national correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg, with whom he traded quips and a robust exchange of ideas, they started by stating the obvious. Such an idealistic initiative is going nowhere. Congress – and we the American people – are not living in generous, starry-eyed times. Even in the age of the first black president, the story has no "legs," as they say in the other culture factory.
That's a shame, because the perfect person to lead a study or a dialogue on reparations – and what's the harm in that? – is the president's wife, Michelle Obama. This is more personal than perhaps she'd like to get in public. But how compelling it would be for a first lady to confront the burden of slavery the country carries, through her own family tale. Mrs. Obama's slave ancestors are known to be resting in a South Carolina graveyard. Her family migrated to Chicago, the classic African-American exodus or journey, from rural to urban. As she goes about her White House activities, she has not said a word about her American family history, letting silence cover it.
A clarifying moment in the old synagogue came when Goldberg noted the Jewish immigrant experience (witnessed within the four walls) led to better and better lives than the ones they left behind. For Coates and the generations of African-Americans whose passage was a series of nightmares from which they could not awaken, well, it's not the same story.
