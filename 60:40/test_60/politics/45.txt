Clinton is continuing to build her political network in states with early primaries as she nears an April start to her 2016 campaign. Ruiz recently worked as political director for Annie's List, which recruits Democratic women to run for office in Texas. Previously she worked on immigration issues at Organizing for America and held political posts in the Obama and Clinton presidential campaigns. Related: [] []
