Ben Carson Launches Presidential Exploratory Committee
Neurosurgeon Ben Carson announced Tuesday that he is formally exploring a run for president in 2016.
Terry Giles, Carson's likely campaign chief, announced the formation of an exploratory committee that will allow the conservative darling to raise funds ahead of a likely bid for the White House.
"In every aspect of Dr. Carson's life, he has exemplified true leadership. Overcoming dire poverty in his youth to become head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Carson is uniquely situated to understand the needs and hopes of all Americans," Giles said. "His undeniable abilities and extraordinary life experiences drive his passion to ensure that, through hard work and perseverance, the American dream remains attainable to all. For the next few months, Dr. Carson looks forward to listening to the American people to gauge support for a presidential candidacy."
Carson is known for making controversial statements about President Barack Obama and Nazi Germany. He finished fourth in last week's straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of activists and party leaders outside Washington, D.C., and received a warm reception at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January.
