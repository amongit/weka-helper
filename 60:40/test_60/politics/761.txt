Obama's Whiskey Rebellion
Calling Cliven Bundy: If you only knew what George Washington would do to you. He'd have you throttled and arrested and then invite your armed militia "friends" to join you behind bars. Your ranch house might get burned down. The former general was not known for mercy to scoundrels.
Bundy's racist speech aside, we've seen this movie before in American history, in the original Wild West stand against the federal government. Bundy has started kind of an uprising in Nevada in defense of letting his cattle roam and graze freely on public lands. For years, he has not paid a penny in fees to the federal bureau that oversees lands that, in effect, belong to all of us. He is brazenly stealing from the common and defying federal authority.

The stakes were higher back in the 1790s. Washington had to play the lead, getting back up on horseback to quell a rebellion in the western lands of Pennsylvania. A wide swath of farmers were protesting a federal excise tax on whiskey, the first such revenue put in place by Washington's Treasury secretary and champion of federalism, Alexander Hamilton.
Washington knew this assault of federalism could not go unanswered. The newborn republic was no longer a loose collection of states, but bound together by the unifying idea of a central government. He could not let a band of wheat-to-whiskey farmers on the western frontier take down what it was all about. The early episode became known as the "Whiskey Rebellion."
The first president rode his signature white horse on a march toward the western part of the fresh-cut country. He did not personally put the rebellion down, but it was put down. Those were the marching orders. Washington was an early master of message, a man of action, not so much words, and a defender of principle.

President Barack Obama has a lot going on. Confrontation is not his strong suit, and there is no reason to comment on a vicious racist who compares himself to Rosa Parks. If necessary, that kind of thing is best done by the blunt Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.
Fortunately, Bundy is losing his political audience. But his challenge to federal control of public lands stands. His posse has intimidated and kept law enforcement at bay. Whether the currency is whiskey or cattle, the federal government is the last word â€“ thank goodness. Civil rights did not come to us through the states. Jim Crow might still live without the powers of federal law. The president must champion it, with words or deeds, and make sure it doesn't get a bad name way out there.
