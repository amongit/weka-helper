Delhi elections: BJP state chief Satish Upadhyay's supporters protest denial of ticket to him
New Delhi: Dissent in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over ticket distribution spilled on the streets a day after the party released its list of candidates with supporters of party's Delhi unit chief Satish Upadhyay staging protests over denial of ticket to him. Another group shouted slogans against Upadhyay and party MP Ramesh Bidhuri and even heckled the former.
Upadhyay's supporters were protesting at the party headquarters over denial of ticket to him. Upadhyay's supporters raised slogans demanding a seat for him. Upadhyay was heckeled outside Delhi BJP office.
Upadhyay appealed to his supporters to calm down and focus on the elections, saying it was his decision not to contest elections. "I appeal to all my supporters to calm down and help party win Delhi elections," he said.
Delhi BJP vice-president Shikha Rai's supporters also took to the streets to protest denial of ticket to her.
On Monday, the BJP said Upadhyay will not be contesting the elections but instead will be managing the election campaign.
