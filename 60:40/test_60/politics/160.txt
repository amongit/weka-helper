Ted Cruz in New Hampshire tells young girl: ‘Your world is on fire’
Speaking in Barrington, New Hampshire, on Sunday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told a young girl that yes, her world is indeed on fire — but that other people were there to make it better.
“The Obama economy is a disaster. Obamacare is a train wreck, and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind — the whole world’s on fire,” Mr. Cruz said, according to video captured by Raw Story.
“The whole world’s on fire?” a young girl asked, the Union Leader reported.
“The world is on fire, yes — your world is on fire. But you know what, your mommy’s here, and everyone’s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better,” Mr. Cruz said to applause.
Mr. Cruz was one of a number of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates to travel to the early presidential state in recent days. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry also made recent stops in the Granite State.
