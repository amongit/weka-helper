The Walker Effect
NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. – Don’t believe the narrative that the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination has come down to a contest between former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and current Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. That’s just media hype, created to give writers something to write about and pundits something to talk about when they’re not beating up on President Barack Obama or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The field of potential GOP candidates is both wide and deep, intellectually as well as politically. It includes governors, former governors, a couple of United States senators and a few political outsiders, all of whom has passionate followings that could shake up the race.
The balloting doesn’t begin for months. Even the Iowa straw poll, which often kills more candidates than it elevates, is still way over the horizon. For all that however, things are not what they seem if the attitudes of the attendees of the reborn, reinvigorated annual Conservative Political Action Conference are any indication.

CPAC is Reagan country. It represents the heart and soul of the conservative coalition that first backed the former California governor for president in 1968 and which almost won the nomination for him at Kansas City in 1976. The conference attendees may now be the sons and daughters – or even grandsons and granddaughters – of those who once labored in the Reagan vineyard, but they are equally as passionate as those who came before them and are, likewise, intent on saving the country from the ravages of a failed presidency comparable in the near term only to Jimmy Carter’s.
Their like of Walker has been a repeated theme. To these people, who think of themselves as political warriors, Walker has been battle-tested and not found wanting. Having, for example, won a considerable victory against the free-spending, taxpayer dollar wasting, largely Democrat-leaning public employee unions in Wisconsin (who tried to recall him from office after the legislature finally passed Act 10, his signature accomplishment), he has refused to rest on his laurels. He has instead pushed ahead and will soon sign into a law a measure sent to him by the legislature making his the 25th “right to work” state in the nation.

To these potential caucus goers and almost certain primary voters, he represents someone who knows how to fight and to win, something that has been missing of late in the national GOP portfolio. They are hungry for a victory, passionate about rolling back Obama’s excesses (of which they believe there are many), but most importantly, they are looking to the future. They want to know what comes next, how to move forward and get America moving again.
They know they will never find another Reagan – indeed, for many at this conference Reagan is just a name they read in a textbook or an image they’ve seen streamed on an iPhone – but they want the next best thing. It’s what they are looking for and, for the moment anyway, Walker just might be it.
If you doubt, consider that a small “meet and greet” scheduled for Thursday night had to be moved to a room several times bigger than the original setting because all the people who wanted to come in could not fit in the room. They wanted to shake his hand, to be photographed with him, to say “thank you” for setting the standard for accomplishment by which other candidates for president are currently being measured. It's too soon to be sure, but he just might be leading a juggernaut that takes him all the way to the top spot in Cleveland and into the White House without breaking stride.
