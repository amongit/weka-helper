Oil Rigs, Jobs Fell in February
Oil fell across the board Friday.
As benchmark oil prices continued to hover near five-year lows, the number of drilling rigs in the U.S. dropped to its lowest point since 2011, and energy firms laid off another 9,300 oil and gas workers in February, the oil services firm Baker Hughes and the U.S. Labor Department reported Friday.

The number of operating oil rigs decreased by 64 from last week, down to 922, Baker Hughes said. Last week’s count marked the first time the number of U.S. oil rigs fell below 1,000 since 2011. Overall, there were 521 fewer U.S. oil rigs this week compared to the same week last year.
Employment is also down in oil and gas fields. With crude selling for less than half the price it was fetching at its height in June, energy companies have let go more than 11,000 workers since the start of the year, the Labor Department said.

Friday’s monthly jobs report for the U.S. workforce at large might put further downward pressure on oil prices, at least within the short-term: Lower than expected unemployment figures for February boosted markets and the U.S. dollar. While that’s generally good news for investors, a stronger dollar makes U.S. oil more expensive for purchasers using foreign currencies.
Longer-term forecasts suggest oil prices might stay low, as well: As U.S. and world energy producers continue pumping oil to retain market share, storage facilities are reaching capacity, meaning a market already awash in oil could soon see even more of it.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. workforce added 295,000 jobs last month.
