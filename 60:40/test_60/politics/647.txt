Apple Posts Record Quarterly Revenue; Could Potentially Buy Most of the Things
Strong holiday retail sales helped Apple Inc. reach gargantuan sales figures during the first quarter of its 2015 fiscal year.
In the three-month period ending Dec. 27, Apple sold a record 74.5 million iPhones, a record 5.5 million Macs and another 21.4 million iPads. Its quarterly revenue reached a personal-best $74.6 billion, with net income in excess of $18 billion.
That’s a 30 percent increase in revenue and 38 percent increase in net income from the same period a year prior, according to the company’s Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These numbers are a little hard to fathom, so let’s break these earnings down.
With its $74.6 billion first-quarter revenue alone, Apple could …

But that doesn’t necessarily mean Apple has $74.6 billion to burn. The company actually had $178.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to work with at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2015.
So Apple, in actuality, would be able to perform one of the feats listed above twice – or pick two – and still have almost $30 billion left over.
Apple’s market capitalization, essentially the value of the company as a whole, on Thursday sat at about $695 billion, with respect to a $118.10 stock price. Only 19 countries in the world have an annual gross domestic product that eclipses that mark. Apple, if it was a country and its market cap was converted to GDP, would rank 20th in the world, behind Saudi Arabia and ahead of Switzerland.
Apple’s $695 billion market cap stands head and shoulders above its closest competition, like Exxon Mobil Corp. ($407 billion) and Microsoft ($396 billion). The company’s value is greater than Google’s ($343 billion), Facebook’s ($202 billion) and Amazon.com’s ($142 billion) market capitalization combined.
Apple's record sales figures were bolstered by total 2014 holiday retail sales of $601.8 billion, up 3.8 percent from 2013, according to the National Retail Federation. The tech giant forecasts its second-quarter revenue will fall short of its record first-quarter performance, landing between $52 billion and $55 billion.
