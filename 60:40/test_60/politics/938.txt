Democrats Decry Phantom Education Cuts
He’s barely been governor long enough for the paint to dry where they stenciled his name on his office door, but Maryland Republican Larry Hogan is already being attacked for trying to slash education funding.
It’s a tried and true tactic used by liberals to try and derail any effort by the GOP to bring spending under control. By focusing on education, they paint a picture of a politician who is heartless, who doesn’t care about children and their future.
In fact, Hogan, the upset winner in last November’s election in a heavily blue state, is doing no such thing. His administration has proposed spending more on K-12 education than any previous occupant of the governor’s mansion. What he has done is slow the rate of increase so that projected spending will decline by just under $150 million.

Some people, mostly Democrats, say what’s left is not enough. But accusing him of cutting funding for education is not only unfair, it’s inaccurate. It’s also a curious outgrowth of a common government budgeting practice that needs to be changed.
Instead of basing figures on what was spent in the previous year, many governments – including the one in Washington – use all kinds of complicated formulas to figure out what spending ought to be from one year to the next. Anything less than that, therefore, qualifies as a cut.
To put it another way, imagine your boss promises you a raise. You crunch the numbers, look over your evaluations, compare your performance in previous years that led to a raise to the year just passed, total up all the spending you plan to do in the next year and decide your raise should be 10 percent of what you’re currently making.
Your boss, having done calculations of his own, decides your raise will be 5 percent. Does that mean you’ve had your pay cut by 5 percent? According to the way most governments do their budgeting, that’s exactly what it means.

Any sane person realizes that kind of analysis is nonsensical. As your pay stubs and tax returns will reflect, your pay has gone up. You’ve gotten an increase, and are probably very glad for it, even if it’s not as much as you thought you deserved.
Hogan’s getting a bad rap, echoed by commentators and reporters who don’t understand what they’re talking about. They are all too ready to believe that Republicans have, as the first item on their agenda, cuts in essential social programs to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. They are all too willing to believe the nonsense being peddled by the GOP’s political opponents. It happens all the time.
The country needs better budgeting, and Maryland is not the only place where reform is required.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would do well to appoint a special bipartisan, bicameral working group to recommend ways to change the federal budgeting process. It needs to be more efficient, more transparent, and to stop penalizing people who won’t rush the process forward because they are trying to find ways to save the taxpayers’ money.
We send people to Congress to make tough decisions. The ban on earmarks instituted by Boehner is a good start, but it’s really small potatoes given that so much federal spending is on autopilot. The Democrats, meanwhile, went almost the entire time Nevada Democrat Harry Reid was majority leader without producing a budget – as the law requires – and without being penalized in any way.

The system is clearly broken and needs to be fixed. That President Barack Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2016 that was released Monday was “dead on arrival” when it got to Capitol Hill is clear enough indication of that. Budget process reform, while arcane and mundane, is desperately needed before the government can enact policies that will create the conditions necessary for the economic growth needed to bail us all out of the $17 trillion hole Obama has gotten us into.
Republicans needs to understand that, until they force a reform measure to the floor, the spending interests will have the upper hand; they hold a sledgehammer they will use to beat any sensible spending cuts to smithereens on the grounds they hurt the poor, the elderly, children, women, military servicemen and women, families, and just about any other group that collectively can be used to pull on our heartstrings. Only when a cut is really a cut will any real progress be made on the effort to get spending in line. Hogan, meanwhile, is doing a good job explaining the truth to the people of Maryland. Boehner, McConnell and other congressional leaders would do well to follow his example.
