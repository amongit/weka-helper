France drug scandal: I never used amphetamines, says Philippe Saint-Andre

As he prepared to announce his team to play Wales in the Six Nations in Paris on Saturday, Philippe Saint-André, the France head coach, was assailed by questions about the doping revelations published in the weekly magazine L’Express.
The revelations are based on testimony from 80 witnesses stretching back over the past three decades contained in a book by investigative journalist, Pierre Ballester.
The scandal, with accusations that French sides of the Eighties were “loaded” with amphetamines, will not fade easily, with further exposés to come following publication of the book, 'Rugby a Charges, l’Enquete Choc', on March 5.
Jacques Mombet, doctor to the French national team from 1975 to 1995, states: “There has always been ­doping in rugby and there always will be. Ventoline [an anti-asthma treatment which can be used to hide traces of amphetamine] was in fashion for a long time among [rugby] professionals.
Players would even have a bottle of it on them and they would slip it in their socks. Rugby cannot escape doping. I see players as neither victims or guilty persons, but as consenting willing victims.”

The most vivid testimony so far revolves around the famous Battle of Nantes match in 1986 when France inflicted the heaviest margin of defeat on New Zealand by winning the second match of a series, 16-3, having lost the first Test in Toulouse.
Mombet reveals that French players had a pill put on a plate as they took their pre‑match meal. Mombet insists that it was not him who administered the pills but another doctor, Jean Pene, who passed away in 2003.
“Above all it was the forwards who were concerned,” Mombet alleges. “If the match was important, if they wanted revenge.”
It was after this game that moves were made to outlaw formally the use of amphetamines. “It was then that the first anti-doping tests were brought in,” said Mombet, who is still an expert for the French anti-doping body (AFLD). “Everyone had known for a long time [what was going on].”
Certainly there were suspicions at the time, notably among the All Blacks themselves.
One of the players injured in that game, New Zealand No 8, Wayne ‘Buck’ Shelford, who needed stitches for a lacerated scrotum and also lost four teeth, revealed on Wednesday that he was not surprised to hear these allegations.

“When I came out of the tunnel and I saw them [the French players], I looked into the eyes of many of the players as I walked past them, and their eyes did not say they were going into a game against the All Blacks,” Shelford told Radio New Zealand. “Their eyes just looked like they were on something, and I could not prove it.”
Several French players have taken exception to the allegations, with centre Philippe Sella threatening legal action.
Saint-André pledged that the sport is clean. “Our doping was passion itself, the desire to play, to make passes,” said the France head coach, a celebrated wing in the Nineties.
“Any journalist can spend a week with us and see that we are clean. On that matter there is no problem. Any player caught doping will be banned. As long as I am coach of France, there will not be that kind of c--- in the French team.”
