Andy Murray needed three sets to beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber and reach the last 16 at Indian Wells.
The Briton, seeded fourth, won 6-1 3-6 6-1 and will play France's Adrian Mannarino, the world number 38, in round four of the BNP Paribas Open.
Murray swept through the final set after Kohlschreiber had found his form to force a decider.
The victory took the Scot to 495 career wins, just one short of Tim Henman's Open-era record for a British man.
Murray played superbly in the first and third sets after Kohlschreiber, ranked 26th, had threatened to push him close with his form in the second.
Murray said he "started trying to play a little further up the court" to regain the initiative at the start of the final set.
"I felt like in the first set I dictated a lot of the rallies. In the middle of the second set I had an opportunity with a break point and played a slightly tentative point. He gained a bit of confidence from that."
The pair had met twice before, both times on clay, with Kohlschreiber winning in Monte Carlo five years ago and Murray edging through 12-10 in the fifth set at last year's French Open.
Murray saved six of the seven break points he faced against Kohlschreiber
Murray, 27, looked like making short work of their third encounter as he relentlessly peppered the baseline on his way to taking the opening set in 25 minutes.
A running forehand pass earned the Briton a break in game four and he made it 5-1 with a thumping return winner off the same wing.
Kohlschreiber, 31, clung on early in the second, seeing off a break point in game five, and began to exert more pressure as Murray's error count crept up.
The German saw four break points slip by at 4-3 before Murray finally cracked with a wild forehand on the fifth, and Kohlschreiber served out to level at one set all.
Murray has not been past the quarter-final in the Californian desert since 2009 but he kept his challenge alive this year with a clinical final set.
Some aggressive returning helped him to break for 2-0 in the decider and Kohlschreiber's backhand crumbled as he quickly fell 4-0 behind.
There were no more alarms for the British number one as he closed out the match on serve after one hour and 51 minutes.
Mannarino earlier upset 14th seed Ernests Gulbis 6-4 6-4, and looking ahead to their first meeting, Murray added: "He's improved a lot over the last 18 months or so.
"He's had a couple of good wins here. He's talented, lefty, a Frenchman. Most of the French players have a bit of flair on the court. I'll have to play well to beat him because he's got a bit of confidence right now."
In the women's draw, teenager Belinda Bencic upset former world number one Caroline Wozniacki, beating the fourth seed 6-4 6-4 in the third round.
The 18-year-old Swiss, ranked 37 in the world, clinched her first victory over a top-five ranked player. It marked a dramatic turnaround from her last meeting against Wozniacki, a 6-0 6-0 reverse in Istanbul last year.
Bencic faces another former world number one, Serb Jelena Jankovic, in the next round.
Five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova needed six match points to grind out a 6-4 6-3 third-round win over Victoria Azarenka.
Sharapova will face defending champion Flavia Pennetta in the last 16.
Nick Kyrgios faces up to a month out of action and has withdrawn from the ATP Tour event in Miami after sustaining an ankle ligament injury on Sunday.
The Australian fell during during his 7-6 3-6 7-6 second round defeat by Grigor Dimitrov at Indian Wells.
The Miami Opens begins on 24 March.
