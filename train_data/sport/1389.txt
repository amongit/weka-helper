Fulham welcome back defender Fernando Amorebieta following his red card in the 5-1 defeat by Bournemouth.
In-form striker Matt Smith could start alongside fellow former Leeds forward Ross McCormack, but winger Alex Kacaniklic will be assessed.
Leeds head coach Neil Redfearn has no major new injury or suspension worries to report as he begins to look at more academy players.
Defender Liam Cooper and striker Mirco Antenucci both return.
