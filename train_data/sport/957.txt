Chris Froome to miss the 2015 Tour de France? I cannot see the Team Sky leader skipping cycling's biggest race

For Chris Froome to come out and say that he might not compete in next year’s Tour de France is a pretty startling statement, especially as he released his comments right in the middle of a presentation in Paris which he did not attend. Talk about putting a bomb under proceedings! I cannot see him skipping the race, though.
I think Chris was just voicing a bit of frustration at a parcours which – while it features plenty of climbing – does not play entirely to his strengths. Just one individual time trial, a short one at that, and right at the beginning of the race, means his ability to make decisive inroads in one of his strongest disciplines is severely compromised. Personally, I don’t think he is too fussed about the cobbles on stage four. It was only because he had already crashed hard that he was fearful this year.
Ultimately, though, it is a climbers’ route and I would be staggered if one of the best climbers in the world, a man who was unable to defend his title this year due to injury, a man who is physically in his prime, voluntarily decided not to turn up.
Certainly it would be unprecedented in the modern era. Sir Bradley Wiggins did not return to defend his title in 2013 but he had been relegated to Plan B by then and had fitness issues with which to contend. Nairo Quintana this year? He is still so young, and Movistar preferred to let him grow away from the Tour. Jacques Anquetil is perhaps the only one I can think of. He could have won in 1965 and elected not to race. But then, he had already won the Tour five times.
I respect Chris a huge amount, both as a man and as a rider. I think he has done a lot of good for the sport and if he decided not to race then I would accept that. But I would be disappointed. A Giro d'Italia-Vuelta a España double is all well and good. It would be an incredible feat. But in terms of sponsors and visibility, it is all about the Tour. I’m sure when they all sit down, they will decide that they simply cannot miss out.

It looks like an exciting route, with a difficult and unpredictable first week, followed by some incredible mountain stages. It really could all come down to that penultimate stage on Alpe d’Huez. The prospect of Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador, Froome, Quintana, even a pure climber like Joaquim Rodríguez, all battling it out, really whets the appetite. As I say, I would be amazed if Froome was not in the mix.
