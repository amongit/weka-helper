Jose Mourinho has promised teenage midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek that he will be playing for Chelsea’s first-team next season.
Loftus-Cheek was promoted to Mourinho’s first-team squad this season and made his senior debut in December as a late Champions League substitute against Sporting Lisbon.
The 19-year-old’s first Premier League appearance came at the end of January, when he replaced Oscar against Manchester City.
Loftus-Cheek is considered one of the most promising young English players and Mourinho has vowed he will not be loaned out or sold, but will instead be handed even more first-team chances next term.
Chelsea captain John Terry remains the last home-grown English player to have a successful career at Stamford Bridge.
“I can say now, Loftus-Cheek is to stay, “said Mourinho. “To stay and I think to stay and to play. I think next year to play, not just to stay. Stay and play.”
Loftus-Cheek has played for England at Under-16, U17 and U19 level, and England coach Gary Neville noted the fact Chelsea are finally giving a chance to a young home-grown talent in his Daily Telegraph column.
Following Loftus-Cheek’s first-team debut against Sporting Lisbon, Neville wrote: “Loftus-Cheek was paraded like some kind of exotic creature. Look, an academy player in the first-team!
“We lined up in the Sky studio excited at the thought of seeing home-grown talent in a Chelsea side. When he played for eight minutes, we showed the highlights of it as a special segment. We were seeing a rare species.”
