England are to play friendly internationals against France and world champions Germany as they step up their preparations for the finals of Euro 2016.
The Football Association is also trying to arrange matches with European champions Spain and Holland in an attempt to provide Roy Hodgson's men with top-notch opposition following what has been a rather undemanding qualifying Group E, which includes Slovenia, Lithuania, Switzerland, Estonia and San Marino. England lead the group by six points following Saturday's 3-1 victory over Slovenia at Wembley and have a 100 per cent record after four victories..
Barring any surprise mishaps in the remainder of theirqualification campaign, England will meet France at Wembley on November 17 and Germany in March 2016.
"They will complement the important Euro qualifiers, which remain the top priority," said Hodgson.
England have already lined up friendlies away to Italy on March 31 and the Republic of Ireland on June 7.
