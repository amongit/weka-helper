England v France: We do not fear French giants at Twickenham, says Dylan Hartley, ahead of Le Crunch

England’s forwards have vowed to land the decisive blow in their side’s bid to seal their first RBS Six Nations title since 2011 by winning what is expected to be a brutal confrontation with one of the biggest France packs to have graced Twickenham.
Dylan Hartley, the Northampton hooker, said the England eight had made a pledge on Thursday morning, when considering the daunting challenge in facing down Les Bleus’ pack, to “take them on” with respect but no fear.
Hartley insisted that England were determined to keep their destiny firmly in their hands in the four-way race for the title and claimed that edging the scrummaging battle against the fearsome front-row trio of Vincent Debaty, Guilhem Guirado and Nicolas Mas would inflict decisive psychological damage on France.

“That’s where it starts,” said Hartley, who will win his 66th cap. “We always hear, it, games won and lost up front; I think this is a weekend where that statement is true. We put that challenge to ourselves, we said [on Thursday morning] after our set-piece bit of training that this is the biggest challenge of the tournament, not because of the game but because of the pack. Respect them, but don’t fear them. Take them on.
“I think we’ve done it many a time before, but, you know you’ve got two teams going for dominance; as an English scrum, at set-piece we look to gain dominance up front, and what that can do to another team is demoralising.
“And if you get your scrummage right, it often leads into other areas of your game being very dominant as well, your breakdown, your mauling game, even your collisions, things like that. So first and foremost, getting the scrum right is huge for us.
Scrum time will be key against the French
“Going into this week, we’ve already had the disappointment [of the Ireland defeat], and our fate is kind of in our hands.”
Graham Rowntree, England’s forward coach, concurred that the scrummaging battle – England actually hold the edge, with a combined front row weight of 52 st to France’s total 51st – would define the contest. France have the luxury of introducing the 23st prop Uini Atonio from the bench.
“It’s everything, more than ever,” said Rowntree, who, as a former England loosehead prop, played against France six times. “Their DNA as a French forward pack is the set-piece, in big games they will go back to that.
• Our experts predict the Six Nations winners • England must lay down a World Cup marker • We rank the World Cup's 20 nations with six months to go
“We’ve spoken about that this week – all the nuts and bolts and components of it have to be tight. Last year we found that, they’re hard work. They’ve got a big forward pack, a big second-row and that will go a long way to winning the game.
“France are always a challenge as a pack. They’re huge men and these guys are not small either, particularly with Debaty coming in. You don’t get many tougher tests as a forward than playing against a French pack.”
Brian Moore, the one of Hartley’s predecessors as England hooker and now a Daily Telegraph columnist, gave an insight earlier this week into the intensity of previous Le Crunch forward contests by Tweeting on Wednesday: “There’s still three days before the England v France game, I’m not even playing and I can feel myself still getting wound up.”

Hartley however insisted that the raw brutality of England v France games in the amateur era had been replaced by a steely composure.
“Gone are the days of head-banging and punching holes in walls [in the changing room before kick-off],” Hartley added.
“James Haskell does a bit of shadow boxing in the corner and I saw him crush a paper cup one time as well. Sport and rugby nowadays is so analytical. It is broken down to clear messages.”
Internally, however, Hartley burns with an unrequited desire to land what in his mind would be a first meaningful piece of silverware with England. The 2011 title win, he revealed, did not feel like any sort of triumph as it came in the wake of a thumping defeat by Ireland.

“When you ask me if I have won the Six Nations, I don’t feel like I have,” Hartley added. “Maybe until the day we do the Grand Slam it probably won’t feel the same either.”
Yet he still insists that should England complete the job – having finished second in the table in the last three seasons since Lancaster took charge – would represent his greatest moment in an England shirt.
“From the outset of the tournament we said we wanted to win it. So yeah, this will be the biggest, for me, and I’m sure for the team as well.”
