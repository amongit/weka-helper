Wayne Rooney should have had an MRI scan after Phil Bardsley boxing 'knockout'

Wayne Rooney's sparring at home in which he appeared to be knocked out put him at risk of a subdural haematoma and potential blood clot, and the 29-year-old England captain "should have been checked into hospital" to undergo an MRI scan according to a medical expert.
That was the view expressed to Telegraph Sport on Sunday after a video was released online which appeared to show the Manchester United footballer being knocked out cold by his former team-mate Phil Bardsley, now of Stoke City, in a sparring session in his kitchen.
It is believed the footage was shot in Rooney's kitchen on February 22 - the day after Manchester United's 2-1 defeat to Swansea. In the video, the two former team-mates pull on boxing gloves and trade blows as they spar in Rooney's Cheshire mansion.
Bardsley, a defender at Stoke City, catches Rooney in the face with a left jab as they circle each other. The punch knocks Rooney out before he lands but the fall leaves him pole axed on the floor, his head narrowly missing a piece of furniture as he lands with his body rigid. Rooney appears unconscious on the floor on his back when the video comes to a sudden end.

Mr Arun Ranganathan, a consulant surgeon in trauma and orthopaedic surgery for the Royal London Hospital, told Telegraph Sport on Sunday: "The skull is a fixed cavity and the brain can be knocked about inside there. There was a risk of brain contusion and subdural haematoma. In some cases, it does not present itself immediately.
"They may think they are OK for the next few days, but it can lead to chronic headaches and to chronic or acute subdural haematomae. This can require surgery and can lead to a blood clot.
"If he was unconscious for more than 30 seconds, it would have warranted a scan to check the condition. His friends should have checked him into hospital, absolutely. Any history of loss of consciousness should be checked out.
"I would not advise anyone to indulge in sparring like this, absolutely," added the consultant surgeon Ranganathan, who revealed he has dealt with "many footballers on a regular basis" when it comes to broken bones.

Consultant neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn concurred. Hamlyn told Telegraph Sport: "The loss of consciousness is significant and has to be taken seriously, but is not necessarily an accurate indicator of the severity of the head injury. If the person is unconscious for a few seconds, it may not be. It it were for longer, then it may be serious.
"He has clearly had a concussive head injury and so you would expect him to follow guidelines. If it had happened on the pitch he would have been closely examined, if it happened at home, it would have been up to him. But professional sportsmen are educated to report these kinds of things."
Hamlyn added: "The thing about head injuries, is that we used to get tied up about knockouts and you went to hopital, but we now know you can get a serious concussion without being knocked out. Likewise you can be completely unconscious and get back to normality very rapidly."
Rooney, 29, has often spoken of his love for boxing, is friends with Manchester fighter Anthony Crolla and super-middleweight fighter Paul Smith from Liverpool, having attended Smith's world title fight in Berlin last month, and in 2007, carried Ricky Hatton's World Boxing Council light-welterweight belt into the ring on his ringwalk when he fought Jose Luis Castillo in Las Vegas.

Rooney boxed when he was in the youth team at Everton and revealed last November he would have considered taking the sport up professionally if he had not made it as a footballer. "I would have tried it as a career," he said then.
In 2008, Rooney said of the sport: "I've always loved watching boxing and I went boxing training for about three or four years when I was younger. It's a sport I've always been involved in. I was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when I was about 15. But Everton who I was with at the time, said I had to concentrate on one of them and I opted for football." It looks like he just can't give it up - to his detriment.
