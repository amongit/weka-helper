Obama predicts Kentucky will win the NCAA Tournament
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama is predicting that Kentucky will remain undefeated and take home the title in the NCAA Tournament.
The basketball fan in chief says there's a good reason the Wildcats are the prohibitive favorite in the tournament after going 34-0 so far. He picked them to beat Villanova in the title game during an interview broadcast Wednesday on ESPN.
The president advanced Arizona and Duke to the NCAA Final Four, scheduled for April 4-6 in Indianapolis.
Obama hasn't picked the correct national champion since his first year in office, when North Carolina won the 2009 championship.
Obama also tells ESPN he would like to see the NCAA move the shot clock from 35 to 30 seconds and move back the lane and three-point line to mirror the NBA.
