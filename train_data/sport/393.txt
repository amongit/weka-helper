Pope Francis 'wants Vatican City to help host Olympics'

Sporting events could be held at the Vatican if Italy is successful in its bid for the 2024 summer Olympics.
Pope Francis, who is a keen football fan, is reported to be keen on the idea of hosting some events in the grounds of the tiny sovereign nation.
The Vatican City State only covers 110 acres, but it has extensive gardens, as well as the wide open space of St Peter's Square, either of which could be used to host an event such as archery.
Matteo Renzi, Italy's prime minister, announced this week that the country would bid for the 2024 games, putting forward a proposal to spread events between Rome, Florence, Milan and Sardinia.
It was quickly suggested that the Holy See might also play a role, although as a separate, albeit minuscule, nation state, it is not clear if it would be allowed to host events under International Olympic Committee rules.

"It seems like a good idea and I think the Pope would approve," said Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, a sports enthusiast and the former head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints. "The Church has always seen sport as a way of promoting healthy values."
Athletes could also find themselves competing in the gardens of Castel Gandolfo, the summer papal residence outside Rome. Canoeing and rowing could be held on the volcanic lake which the papal residence overlooks.
"There's ample space at Castel Gandolfo, which at the moment is rarely used," Cardinal Martins said.

The head of the Italian Olympic Committee, Giovanni Malago, is expected to broach the idea with Pope Francis when he meets him on Friday for a special Mass to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the committee.
Pope Francis is an avid football fan and closely follows the fortunes of his club, San Lorenzo, in his native Argentina. Under his pontificate, the Vatican has formed a cricket team, the St Peter's XI, which toured England over the summer, playing teams from the Church of England.
