Commonwealth Games day 10: as it happened
By Alan Tyers (08.00 to 15.50) and Giles Mole (thereafter)
10:00PM BST 02 Aug 2014
• Full schedule | Full medals table • Gallery of Commonwealth Games gurners • Usain Bolt has a pop at Beeb's Gabby Logan • England lose netball semi in last-second heartbreaker • Nicola Adams wins boxing gold with split decision • Hockey men lose Oz semi | Marital badminton news! What has been your highlight so far? Send all your thoughts to please

22.08 Right folks, that's it from me. It's been an amazing night of sport. Usain Bolt, Tom Daley, Joy Joyce and the England men's 4x100m relay team. Join us tomorrow for more action and the closing ceremony. It should be something special. And I leave you with this image, what else?...

22.04 Bronze for England's Gabby Adcock and Lauren Smith in the women's badminton doubles, beating Malaysia's Lim Yin Loo and Lai Pei Jing in a war of attrition.
Golden girl Adams does it again
21.58 Australia win gold in the women's hockey, beating England in a penalty shoot-out!
21.57 England make a mess of their fourth attempt and it's still 2-1 to Australia. Each team has one more pen. If Australia score with their next attempt, they are the Commonwealth champions.
21.55 Australia win a stroke from their fourth penalty attempt, the goalie taking the player not the ball... and she's missed! Can you believe it. England with a chance to level.
21.54 England miss their third pen and Australia lead 2-1 after three attempts...
21.53 Australia score their third pen and lead 2-1...
21.52 England miss their second penalty. It's 1-1 after two attempts...
21.52 Save! England save Australia's second pen...
21.51 It's 1-1 as England covert their first pen...
21.51 Penalties in the hockey and Australia are up first... and score!
21.48 Oh nooooo! Hockey heartbreak for England! Just 11 seconds from the final whistle and Australia's Jodie Kenny scores from a penalty corner.
21.46 After the negative headlines earlier in the week, Usain Bolt is endearing himself to the Scots all over again by wandering around Hampden wearing a Tartan tammy.
21.37 England's Joe Joyce takes gold in the battle of the super heavyweights, beating Australia's Joseph Goodall in the final.
Joe Joyce caps 5 gold medals for England ... And top of the medal table...

21.31 Anyone who's wondering whether Bolt was trying... take a look at his face. That's trying!

21.27 England have taken a 1-0 lead in the women's hockey final against Australia as 19-year-old Lily Owsley keeps her cool.
21.26 Jamaica's winning time in the relay final is a new Games record of 37.58secs.
21.22 JAMAICA WIN THE GOLD in the men's 4x100m final... and it's a silver for England!! Trinidad and Tobago claim bronze.
21.21 And we're off...
21.16 Bolt is so relaxed on the track he's dancing to The Proclaimers while the other runners put their game faces on.
21.15 OK, here we go, it's the big one... the men's 4x100m relay final. And all eyes will be on one man, you know who I mean. Jamaica should have the gold in their pocket but England will fancy claiming a medal of some colour, especially with Adam Gemili - the men's 100m silver medallist - in their ranks.
21.12 Australia's Alana Boyd claims gold in the women's pole vault as Sally Peake of Wales has to settle for silver after failing with her final attempt. England's Sally Scott and Canada's Alysha Newman share the bronze medal.
21.10 Five minutes to go until Usain Bolt runs in the men's 4x100 relay final. And the big man is out on the track warming up.
21.05 Daley's victory in the diving was by an incredible 82.85 points. His lead was so great that he had secured bronze before he went for his final routine.
21.00 It's half-time in the women's hockey final between England and Australia and it's 0-0.
20.58 England claim bronze in the women's 4x100m final. Jamaica, unsurprisingly, win gold in 41.83secs - a Game's record.
20.56 TOM DALEY WINS GOLD IN THE MEN'S 10M PLATFORM
20.54 Julius Yego wins men's javelin gold.
20.52 The Jamaican women's 4x100m quartet, anchored by Shelley-Anne Fraser-Pryce, are red-hot favourites and they're out on the track.
20.48 So far there have been 31 attempts in the women's pole vault and 27 failures due to the rain. At the moment 3.80m is enough to earn you a medal. That height would have been last place in Delhi.
20.45 Without wishing to jinx him, Daley surely has gold in his grasp after a superb back 3.5 somersault. With one dive left, the 20-year-old is a long way ahead of Vincent Riendeau.
20.42 We're 20 minutes into the women's hockey gold-medal match between England and Australia and it's 0-0 so far.
20.40 Four dives in and Daley is looking hot for the gold. His forward 4.5 somersault scores 79.55 and sees him ahead of Canada's Riendeau and Malaysia's Tze Liang.
20.38 Here are the team sheets for the men's 4x100m relay final...

20.34 Chris Langridge and Peter Mills have beaten England compatriots Chris Adcock and Andy Ellis 2-0 in their men's badminton doubles bronze medal play-off.
20.32 Antony Fowler, cousin of former Liverpool forward Robbie, wins another boxing gold for England with a powerful performance to see off Indian middleweight superstar Vijender.
A flurry of sharp hooks dumped Vijender on the canvas midway through the opening round, with the Indian complaining he had been hit while on the deck. A right hook on the bell to end the round underlined Fowler's dominance, and although Vijender drew on his experience to drag himself back into the fight his moments of success were too fleeting to seriously threaten to turn the fight around.
The final minute of the third arguably proved Vijender's most successful as he rammed home a straight left, but there was never any doubt that the Liverpool fighter would get the unanimous verdict.
20.27 England's 14-year-old Matthew Dixon with a brilliant inward 3.5 somersault routine and scores 81.60. The new Tom Daley?
20.25 Daley update! It's looking good for Tom at the halfway stage of his final - his third dive bags a score of 81.60 and he remains ahead with three dives to go.
20.15 GOLD FOR ENGLAND!! Matthew Hudson-Smith holds off Chris Brown of the Bahamas to help win the men's 4x400m relay final.

20.14 It's Trinidad in first but England are just behind and catching...
20.13 Trinidad move into the lead but England are second as we enter the third lap...
20.12 We're off in the men's 4x400m. England hand over first change in first...
20.11 Meanwhile, in the diving pool, Daley still leads after two dives, he gets through the 'demon dive' but it's not great with a score of 64.80. He has a total of 159.30, and leads from Dominic Bedggood. In case you're not sure, the 'demon dive' is a back 2.5 somersault, 2.5 twists routine.
20.09 Colin Jackson calls it the most exciting race of the night... it's the men's 4x400m final. And he's possibly right as this could go any way.
20.07 England's Anthony Fowler claims gold in the men's middleweight boxing, beating India's Vijender Vijender in the final.
20.04 Over to the diving and next up for Daley is his "demon dive", which went horribly wrong this morning. Can he keep it together this time? He's bound to be nervous!

20.01 Idowu looking good through the hop and step but flat in the air in the men's triple jump. He's currently fifth with a 16.45m.
20.00 Yego takes the lead in the men's javelin after the third round with a throw of 83.67m.
19.59 Good start for Tom Daley, he leads the 10m platform final after the first dive, executing his armstand back triple somersault with a score of 94.50. Daley's rival for the gold, Australia's Matthew Mitcham, is already over 20 points down after a poor forward 3.5 somersault.
19.53 Gold for Jamaica, silver for Nigeria and England claim bronze in the women's 4x400m relay final.
19.52 This looks like a race between Jamaica and Nigeria as we go into the final leg. England have a decent lead over Australia in the battle for bronze...
19.51 Jamaica flying threw a curtain of rain as they open up a lead. Nigeria in second and England third as we hand over again...
19.49 The rain is lashing down again. It's a good start by Ohuruogu... and England hand over first.
19.47 On the track are the women's 4x400m relay final competitors. Christine Ohuruogu goes first for England.
19.46 Philips Idowu is up next in the men's triple jump final. Here's his first attempt..... hop, skip, jump... and a red flag. Not the best start.
19.43 The men's javelin final is starting - no British competitors, but Kenya's Julius Yego opens with a mighty 75m throw. What can Keshorn Walcott do? He threw 85m in qualification. And he takes the lead with 82m.
19.38 James Magut of Kenya wins the men's 1,500m final. New Zealand's Nick Willis finished like a speeding train to claim bronze but he surely should have gone earlier. If he had, gold could have been his.
19.36 In the women's hockey bronze medal match, New Zealand have secured a 5-2 win over South Africa to claim a third-place finish.
19.34 Good British contingent in the men's 1,500m up next - Gowell of Wales, Scotland's O'Hare and England's Grice.
19.26 A tearful Hannah Starling is surprised by her podium finish...
"I did not expect a medal at all. I don't look at the scores so it was a complete shock to me. Going into that final I didn't think I had a very good (first) two dives. In my head I was thinking, 'I've not done too well'.
"I somehow pulled it back with my last three (dives) and I cannot believe that I finished in third. It was a dream to come away with a medal, but then I pulled myself back to reality. I can't believe it. I finish fourth quite a lot of the time. This time I was on the right side of the points. To finally have an individual medal on a stage like this is just amazing for me."
19.23 BRONZE medal for England's Jo Pavey in the women's 5,000m final! What a race from the 40-year-old. Kenya's Cherono wins gold.
19.22 Pavey isn't giving this up and with one lap to go she leads.
19.19 Three laps to go in the women's 5,000m and Pavey takes the lead.
19.17 In the women's 5,000m, England's Jo Pavey is keeping pace with the three Kenyan girls as she moves into second.
19.15 England's Hannah Starling has claimed bronze in the women's 3m springboard. Esther Qin of Australia won gold with a score of 347.25 ahead of Canada's Jennifer Abel, the 1m springboard champion, who finished with 324.70.
Starling scored 67.50 for her final dive, a forward two-and-a-half somersault with one twist, to score a total of 316.95 and take her place on the podium.
Alicia Blagg, who won gold in the synchronised event alongside Rebecca Gallantree on Wednesday, was seventh. Scotland's Grace Reid (297.50) was ninth and Gallantree (292.20) was 10th in the individual event
19.09 It's raining, it's a bit chilly... perfect long-distance running conditions. The surface on the inside of the track looks dryish and the England girls - Pavey, Clitheroe and Gorecka - are out in front.
19.06 Ok, here we go, the final of the women's 5,000m. More from Mr Bloom...
"Right. The women's pole vault has been delayed by 45mins. No one seems to have any idea what is happening with the javelin and triple jump but the athletes are out there warming up. There is definitely no delay with the track events though and we are just about to kick things off with the women's 5,000m final"
19.04 Our man in Hampden, Ben Bloom, sends this in...
"All field events have been delayed by 45mins apparently. Not had official confirmation yet but that is the word here at Hampden Park. Not sure how much it will help unless the rain stops. Don't know if it's just me being optimistic but it does appear to be brightening up."
But then emails this...
"This is all a bit bizarre. The rain has now come back heavier but all the athletes are out and readying themselves for action. So it seems we will only be starting slightly later than planned and the women's pole vault will indeed go ahead. The triple jump is going to be like jumping into cement"
WEATHER UPDATE... the athletics field events will be delayed by 45 minutes because of the heavy rain. The track events will start as planned.
18.50 Chat from Hampden is that the athletics might be delayed because of the weather. We'll bring you more on that as we get it.
18.44 Ouch! In the women's 3m springboard final, Maddison Keeney of Australia has just rattled her toes off the board during her dive.
WEATHER UPDATE AT HAMPDEN...
"I can count nine people with brooms, mops and all sorts of equipment currently attempting the utterly fruitless task of removing water from the pole vault area. The women's final is scheduled to begin at 7pm but is real jeopardy apparently. It may well simply be too wet to be safe to jump. Still they try to mop and still the rain thunders down. Can't fault their efforts"

18.38 Paddy Barnes has shrugged off an anthem controversy after claiming Commonwealth Games boxing gold with victory over India's Devendro Laishram at the Hydro.
Barnes was caught on television cameras mouthing "that's not my anthem" to his vanquished opponent as the opening strains of 'Danny Boy' blared out in the 20,000-capacity arena. But Barnes quickly took to Twitter to insist his comment had no political connotations as he celebrated retaining the light-flyweight title he first won in Delhi in 2010.
Barnes tweeted: "So I said that's not my anthem, so who cares, it's not NI hasn't got one educate yourselves, football is GSTQ [God Save The Queen] so make your minds up!"
He added: "I'm a sportsman I couldn't care about anything else, I'm Irish, doesn't matter if I'm Catholic of Protestant. I won that medal for everyone that supports me, Catholics and Protestants alike, I don't care what your religion is! Some clowns out there!"
18.25 In the women's 3m springboard final, with each athlete having dived once, England's Alicia Blagg has posted the highest score.
18.21 Josh Taylor was overcome with emotion as Flower of Scotland rang round The Hydro for the second time in quick succession...
"I almost couldn't sing it, I couldn't hold my emotions together. Tears of joy, not tears of disappointment this time, thank God. I imagined it being amazing and everybody singing, but that was just surreal. It was a thousand times better. I could only sing it in bits because I would have broken down in tears. My body feels numb right now, I can't believe it."
18.19 Competing in a Commonwealth Games final is not enough for Matthew Dixon, the 14-year-old from Plymouth who was competing in the men's 10m platform final on Saturday evening.
Dixon and 13-year-old fellow diver Victoria Vincent, who was 10th in the corresponding women's event, are trying to beat each other to collect all of the pin badges from the 71 Commonwealth federations.
Asked if he has more than Vincent, Dixon laughed: "I think so. The pin badge collection is going really well. They're all back at the hotel. I've got one from every diving nation and a lot of other nations. I'd like to try to get all of them."

18.14 The diving is nearly upon us. Which Tom Daley will we see tonight in the men's 10m platform final? It wasn't pretty from Daley earlier with his yips over the back two-and-a-half twister.
The person responsible for the music at Edinburgh's Royal Commonwealth Pool had a sense of humour after a number of divers preliminaries - including Daley - suffered wince-inducing landings.
Daley mistimed the landing on his "demon" dive, but responded strongly to qualify in first after U2's Vertigo had been played over the public address system.
India's Siddharth Pardeshi had the landing which looked the most painful, falling from the top platform and nearly flat on his back to cries of "ooh" from the watching spectators.
Daley had ice cling-filmed to the back of his arms after the qualifying session - and with good reason, apparently.
"This is just for recovery," he said. "If you freeze a chicken breast it lasts longer, so if you freeze your triceps hopefully they should last longer too."
18.06 It's really not a night for fast times on the track... but that's not stopping these hardy souls as the queue to get into Hampden gets bigger and bigger...

<noframe>Twitter: Darren Campbell - It's raining really heavy here, relay is even more difficult in the rain!!</noframe>
17.55 These two - Taylor and Flynn - will find themselves on the front pages of the Scottish papers tomorrow after both claimed boxing gold...

Here's what Flynn had to say: "I knew he was going to come out firing and straight away he runs out - bang, bang, bang. I knew I had to step to the side and go to war with him. And it worked. All the tippy-tappy stuff was out the window. I knew I needed a high work-rate but it's hard when he's so awkward."
The Motherwell boxer said he was "buzzing like a jar of wasps" after the victory and the experience of fighting in front of a home crowd of almost 13,000.
"The roar was unbelievable," he said. "It was silence, bang, the shot lands and you just hear it echoing up and up and up. It was like a thunderstorm, a volcano.
"You feel it in your chest when you're in there, roaring in your chest."
17.45 Scotland's Robert Blair and Imogen Bankier hammer Malaysia's Chan Peng Soon and Lai Pei Jing to win mixed badminton bronze.
17.41 Mr Bolt goes in the final of the men's 4x100 relay and if you're lucky enough to have a ticket... bring a brolly!

17.35 Favourites Singapore have beaten Australia 3-1 in the final of the table tennis women's doubles - Feng Tianwei and Yu Mengyu sealing victory with a 11-5 win in the fourth game.
Olympic medal standings by country - top five
Country G S B Total
1 England 50 53 46 149
2 Australia 42 41 44 127
3 Canada 30 14 32 76
4 Scotland 19 14 18 51
5 India 14 25 16 55
17.28 It's time for a quick break in the boxing. But there will be more at about 19:00 BST when England's Savannah Marshall goes toe-to-toe with Ariane Fortin of Canada in the women's middleweight final.
17.21 Nicola Adams is all smiles after winning gold...

17.13 Ali Jawad is now targeting going even heavier in future competitions after his powerlifting bronze...
"I've been hitting big numbers in the gym, so I just had to execute my technique under pressure. I asked for a fourth attempt today to try and go for 200kg but they said no - so I was going to put it on the bar. I think I need to be hitting 200kg more consistently at the gym before I bring it to a major championships - I was only going to bring it out today if I really needed it but I didn't need it."
17.01 Has Taylor done enough? He thinks he has. Here comes the result... and Taylor wins!! Another gold for Scotland.
17.00 A torrid last round for Taylor as he takes some real punishment. Jonas has kept his best for last but is it all a bit too late? Why didn't he do this earlier on?!
16.56 Back to the boxing and Taylor takes the second round too - and again all three judges agree. He's one round away from becoming Scotland's second consecutive gold medallist.
16.55 Laura Massaro after having to settle for squash silver...
"I'm disappointed that we didn't win but we gave it our all. We've had a great week and I'm proud of the silver. I'm more proud of my performances in the doubles than the singles really. We don't play it for four years so for us to come together as a pair with very little preparation and perform like that is something to be proud of."
16.52 Great first round by Taylor - every judge gives it to the Scotsman.
16.46 Josh Taylor enters the ring to yet another mammoth cheer - yes, you guessed it, he's Scottish. He's up against Namibia's Junias Jonas. Not quite the same roar for Jonas. This is the final bout this afternoon before this evening's action, let's hope it's a good'un.
16.35 England's Jenny Duncalf and Laura Massaro have had to settle for silver after being outclassed by Indian pair Dipika Pallikal and Joshana Chinappa in the women's squash doubles final. Pallikal and Chinappa needed just 28 minutes to secure an 11-6 11-8 victory in the gold-medal match at Scotstoun.
The result meant a second silver medal of Glasgow 2014 for Massaro - and third Commonwealth silver overall - following her singles final defeat to Malaysia's Nicol David, and a second Commonwealth silver for Delhi singles runner-up Duncalf.
16.30 The bell goes and there's no doubt about our winner... young Charlie Flynn in front of his adoring home fans. A great left hook in the last round was the icing on the cake. Here comes confirmation... Flynn has the gold by unanimous decision!
16.29 Massive cheers from the crowd every time Flynn lands a punch. Fitzpatrick really has to go for it now...
16.27 Great start to round two by Fitzpatrick but Flynn gradually takes control and, once again, he takes the round.
16.22 First round to Flynn! The Scot holds the advantage after finishing the round really strongly. Clean sweep on the judge's scorecards.
16.17 Huge roar in the boxing ampitheatre as Scottish 19-year-old Charlie Flynn walks out for his 16kg lightweight division gold medal clash against Norhern Ireland's Joe Fitzpatrick.
16.16 Nicola Adams has done more than anyone to advance the cause of women's boxing but on Saturday in Glasgow she was given a timely reminder of the precarious nature of her status as women's flyweight number one.
"Everybody is coming for me now because I am the number one in the world, and I have got to expect that everybody who gets through those ropes wants to beat me. I think it was a really close contest but I think I did enough to win. I think Michaela is a very good talent and she will come again and we will be seeing a lot more from here in the future."
He beaten opponent Michaela Walsh was in tears on the podium having insisted moments after her triumph that it was Adams's reputation alone which had made the difference on the judges' scorecards.
And Adams added: "I've been in that situation when I wanted to win the world title and only got silver. I worked hard for it and it just wasn't my time but my time was at the Olympics."
16.14 Courtesy of Darren Campbell, here are the lane draws for all of the relays this evening...

16.06 England have secured two Commonwealth Games medals in the powerlifting as Natalie Blake takes silver and IPC world champion Ali Jawad bronze.
16.03 It's Conlon! Gold to Northern Ireland.
16.01 Conlon and Ashfaq throwing a flurry of punches! What a finish to the round and the contest. Who has won?
15.58 Second round to Conlon and all three judges in agreement.
15.55 One good punch to that cut eye of Conlon's and Ashfaq will win this because the ref will have to stop the fight. Conlon doing well, though, to shield his face.
15.54 Conlon and Ashfaq are going toe-to-toe, punches flying all over the place. Conlon showing better varity but his English opponent using his feet well. Conlon has a rather nasty cut above his eye. Two of the three judges have given the first round to Ashfaq.
15.50 I am going to hand over the blog to Mr Giles Mole, who will talk you through the boxing contest between Northern Ireland's Michael Conlan, who suffered a cut in an accidental clash of heads in the semi. He faces Qais Ashfaq of England. Seconds out, Mole in, round one! Cheers.
15.41 Andrew Moloney of Australia has won the flyweight boxing over Muhammad Waseem of Pakistan.
15.39 And the para-sport lightweight powerlifting is underway with Ali Jawad, the Englishman who is world champ, going into third place with two lifts to go.
15.37 England's Emma Beddoes and Alison Water have delivered bronze in the women's doubles squash.
15.35 More from Gareth A Davies at the boxing.
Managed to get a smile out of Michaela Walsh. She told me she's getting some gold spray paint anyway and going on a rampage with it tonight.

15.30 Disappointing news from Ben Bloom:
Former world and Commonwealth 400m champion Amantle Montsho has become the second athlete to fail a drugs test at Glasgow 2014.
Montsho, of Botswana, came into these Commonwealth Games as the reigning 400m but missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in Tuesday's final as Stephanie McPherson led a Jamaican clean sweep.
The 31-year-old has now been suspended from all competition after her A sample tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine. Her B sample will be tested on Monday.
Yesterday Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha was stripped of her Commonwealth gold after failing a doping test.
The 16-year-old, who won the women's 53kg competition, provided positive A and B samples that contained prohibited diuretics and masking agents.
15.15 Mixed news from the squash. England's Peter Barker and Alison Waters beat their Kiwi oppo in the mixed doubles semi. But James Wilstrop and Daryl Selby have gone down 2-0 to Australia in the mens doubles semi.
15.04 In the men's light fly, there is glory for Northern Ireland's Paddy Barnes, who has made history by becoming the first man in 40 years to defend a Commonwealth boxing title.
"You could have put them in a phone box for that fight," says Amir Khan. "There was no movement there and they just stood there throwing punches."
14.59 And here's the scoreboard, as snapped by Gareth, who says: "Here's the scoring - not the best picture but it shows how confusing the bout was ... Split decision no surprise for me."

14.56 And here she is talking to reporters.

14.43 Here's a proud Nicola Adams getting the gold.

14.38 Back to Rod Gilmour in the badminton.
The Drinkhalls, Paul and Joanna, were full of nudges and pushes in the mixed zone after their marvellous 3-2 win to take mixed doubles gold. They've got a dog, Milly, they've just purchased a flat and Paul was complaining that Joanna set him tasks even if there wasn't anything to do. Perhaps clean all those medals they've now won. It is almost as if I was talking to the Adcocks, who won their badminton semi earlier today. Ironic the two couples got married only a week apart from each other last year.
"I'll be celebrating with a bottle of champagne, or several bottles," says Paul Drinkhall.
"I've got the bronze medal match in the women's doubles first!" says wife Joanna.
"I'll be cheering her on... with a bottle of champagne," says Paul.
14.37 India's hockey men have produced a fine comeback to beat New Zealand 3-2. They will face mighty Australia in the final; England play the Kiwis for bronze.
14.35 Higher quality bout in the women's lightweight, and Shelley Watts of Australia wins the gold with a unanimous verdict over India's Laishram Devi.
14.30 I think this is a fair tweet. I mean, she's only a kid, Michaela. Sure she will put this behind her. At 21, she's ten years the junior of Nicola and there is ample time for her.
<noframe>Twitter: Kim Harris - Poor Michaela Walsh is just disappointed, not a sore loser. Her time will come. Nicola Adams is a proper sporting superstar!</noframe>
14.19 "I know in my heart that I won the fight. I wanted it more. I feel as if I have been cheated. But it's not her fault," Michaela Walsh there, gracious in defeat.
Shame, always harsh to interview an athlete moments after a big disappointment. In weeks to come one imagines she will reflect on an excellent effort to win silver rather than the disappointment of missing out on gold.

14.16 Split decision.... in favour of NICOLA ADAMS. Tight, but correct, call seems to be the consensus.

14.14 Gareth on round four: Again it is scrappy, and it looks like Adams' cornermen have told her to stand off and jab and counter. Walsh remonstrates about the holding. Another messy round. Not surprising that is a split decision. Adams is delighted by the result as she makes history again, but not her best. By a long way. Walsh clearly very disappointed. Shakes her finger.

14.13 Gareth on round three: "Adams landing good counter right hands but Walsh responding. Adams should stay behind her jab, as Amir Khan advised on this blog yesterday, but it looks like she wants to thrill the crowd and is rushing her work. The Olympic champ is marginally ahead, but this is a different fighter, different style from two years ago."
14.10 Gareth on round two: "The second round descended into a scrappy period, with so much clinching little was scored for the purist. Adams' jab, one right hand, and a glancing left may have won her the round. This is a very close bout."
14.05 Gareth A Davies on round one: "Adams, in the blue corner, kept her distance in the opening minute, bouncing on her toes looking for openings. There were few. Walsh was patient, not rushing in. Clever tactics. They clinched in the last forty seconds, then Adams, as is now customary from her, went on the attack with 40 seconds of the first round remaining. Her tactics are to catch the judges' eyes. That first round could be seen either way, but the best punch was Adams' right hand."
14.02 Good start by Walsh, jabbing well, but Adams has caught her on the counter a few times.
14.00 Anyhow, we turn quickly to boxing, where Nicola Adams takes to the ring to fight Michaela Walsh of Northern Ireland. Nicola in the blue. History to be made, this is the first time there has been women's boxing at the Games. Four two-minute rounds.
13.55 Decider! But the Drinkhalls are using their experience to pull away, perhaps stung by giving up that two game lead. It's soon 10-4 in their favour and they get the point they need via a net cord, a bit of an unworthy end for a fine match, but a very well contested match. Well done to Paul Drinkhall and Joanna Drinkhall, but also a great sign for the future of English table tennis - Tin-Tin Ho is only 15 and partner Liam Pitchford is 21. England won the bronze as well.
13.45 BACK IN THE GAME! Table tennis. Liam and Tin-Tin have taken the third game. And despite an iffy start to the fourth game, two poor returns from Tin-Tin, they are 7-5 ahead in this one. But the Drinkhalls are starting to gather momentum here and the slice of Joanna is causing some problems, and a four point lead is eaten up. It's best of five games by the way. At 8-7 up, Liam and Tin-Tin call a time out. An excellent point from Liam Pitchford takes it to 9-8. Two excellent returns from Paul Drinkhall save two game points. BuUt Paul's hit a forehand long, and it's 12-10. Two games all!
13.50 Turning from the table tennis to the boxing, it's Gareth A Davies
Michael Conlan, the Olympic bronze medallist is slated, to meet England's Qais Ashfaq this afternoon, but his appearance in his first Commonwealth final hinged on a medical this morning.
Conlan suffered a nasty-looking cut over his right eye in yesterday's semi-final win over Wales' Sean McGolderick following an accidental clash of heads.
News is that he was cleared this morning.
13.35 I learn from the BBC commentary that Paul Drinkhall is an attacking player but wife Joanna has a defensive mindset. On the one hand, this means that Tin-Tin and Liam have a wide variety of different spins to deal with, but on the other hand, they can be fairly sure that if they play to Joanna, she's not going to attack them.
The quality of the coverage is excellent on the BBC, I've just learned a huge amount about different serve grips and the styles favoured by different nations, from expert pundit Ian Marshall. Apparently Tin-Tin has a penhold grip that is now an anachronism in the women's game and is rarely seen these days. So there you go!
Anyhow, penhold grip or not, it's not really happening for Tin-Tin and Liam, the combination of the heavy slice from Joanna and the vicious top-spin of Paul proving too hot to handle and the Drinkhalls are two games to nil up.
13.30 Rod Gilmour turns his attention from the badminton to the table tennis.
All set for another husband and wife combo? England are guaranteed a medal in the table tennis mixed doubles as Paul and Joanna Drinkhall, the husband-and-wife team, go head-to-head with compatriots Liam Pitchford and Tin-Tin Ho. Paul, 24, and Joanna, 27, seem to have been around British table tennis for an age. They are a formidable pair. A gold for the mantelpiece?

13.00 The Kiwis lead the Indian men 2-1 in the second half of the hockey semi; the winners will contest the gold medal with Australia.
12.57 Tom Daley, despite a dodgy second dive, tops the table in the prelim round. The real action starts at 19.30.
12.55 An update from Tom Cary
New Zealand 2-1 up against India in the second men's hockey semi but the Kiwi journos in the press room here at the national hockey centre can barely raise a smile. They spent the first 10 minutes of the match crowded around a laptop watching the last knockings of the Super 15 final. The Crusaders' agonising last-gasp defeat by Waratahs has sent them into depths of despair. The hockey will probably be too late for their final edition deadlines anyway.
12.45 But Liam Pitchford has lost a titanic 4-3 clash in the table tennis semi against the top seed Ning Gao of Singapore.
12.40 There's men's doubles in squash as we speak, England v Scotland.
12.35 In the men's badminton doubles, Chris Langridge and Peter Mills are going nicely in their semi against Singapore, they're 1-0 up in games. Langridge has already reached the final of the mixed.
12.30 In the other netball semi, the Aussies seem to be well on top against Jamaica.
12.20 Tom Daley has made a pig's ear of his second dive, his back 2.5 somersault, 2.5 twists was a shocker, he scored just 37.8, a very poor score for a diver of his standing. Just to clarify, though, all 11 divers in the prelim round go through to tonight's final, but a poor placing can give you a disadvantageous place in the running order.
12.15 Kirsty Gilmour of Scotland has produced a superb comeback in the second game of her women's singles badminton match. She trailed 11-19 but came back to win 21-19 and take the match 2-0. Gilmour will contest the gold tomorrow.
11.57 Natalie Blake of England has won a sliver in women's lightweight powerlifting.
11.55 Over to the diving pool, where Tom Daley is bidding to qualify for the final tonight. All seems to be progressing smoothly enough.

11.54 Quotes from the netball women.
Maria Tutaia "You have to give mad props to the English team, they played a great game. But we came here to fight and we came here to win."
Joanne Harten: "That was two years in the making, we put our hearts and soul into it but we couldn't do it. We are gutted. We practice these situations in training, 20 seconds to go, we work on how to get the ball up the court."
11.34 Shame, the Aussies have beaten England 4-1 in the men's hockey semi. Here's our man Tom Cary with the story:
England will play for the bronze medal on Sunday after losing 4-1 to Australia in a wet semi-final at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday.
There had been a whiff of controversy in the build-up to the match with some of the England camp upset at the early start time of 10am.
The official reason given was to allow for a longer rest period between the semi-finals and the medal rounds on Sunday. Midfielder Ashley Jackson was not buying that, however, suggesting that the demands of Australian television overlords may have been more decisive.
"It is absolute rubbish," Jackson told reporters on Friday. "An Australian TV company dictates what happens over here in Glasgow. "It is very irritating, but it has happened now and hopefully come the start it will have no effect except to give us extra motivation to get off to a good start, which will be crucial."
It was crucial. But unfortunately it was Australia who were quickest out of the blocks. Barely two minutes were on the clock when England conceded a penalty corner and Tristan White put the ball away after an initial save.
It set the tone for the first half, with Australia pressing and England trying to hit the No 1 side in the world on the counter as and when the opportunity arose.
Australia doubled their advantage after 11 minutes when Simon Orchard ran the ball across the top of the circle and fired it across George Pinner into the bottom left hand corner.
Even the temporary departure of Australian captain Mark Knowles, yellow carded after Australia inadvertently fielded an extra player,
could not stem the tide, and England were forced to face another penalty corner on the stroke of half-time, although this time it came to nothing.
While the score remained at 2-0, England were always in with a chance and they gave the crowd at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre something to shout about midway through the second half when David Condon ran the ball along the baseline before setting up Harry Martin to tap home.
Any hopes of a comeback were erased, however, when Chris Ciriello scored his sixth of the tournament and Eddie Ockenden wrapped things up with one minute remaining.
11.24 Both teams have scored five goals in the final quarter in the women's hockey, and it is England 34 New Zealand 34 with one minute 20 seconds left. I don't know jack about hockey, but it looks to me that the Kiwis have a bit more composure, a bit more experience. But New Zealand's Brown has missed a sitter.. England have chances. But they have lost the ball cheaply! Kadeen Corbin, I think, is the player who has lost the ball with a sloppy turnover. Here come the Kiwis... there's two seconds on the clock. Marai Tutaia has a simple chance and she drains it, ice cool finish. Scenes! NEW ZEALAND WIN 35-34 and the English are distraught. Kadeen Corbin sobs as team-mate hugs her. The expert commentators are asking if Anna Mayes got the tactics right in ref substitutions.

11.23 In the mens' hockey, it looks grim for England, who trail the Aussies 3-1.
11.21 Hannah Starling and Rebecca Gallantree of England have qualified for the 3m springboard diving final tonight. Scotland's Grace Reid will join them
11.19 England keep the Kiwis quiet for a while but finally NZ have a goal and it's 32-34, and then Kiwis score again to narrow it to 33-34. England give it away cheaply, they look rattled.
11.15 Bad badminton news, Rajiv Ouspeh of England has lost his semi in the men's singles. Kashyap Parupalli of India the victor.
11.11 Back to Bloomy at the netball
In the second quarter England gave away a five-goal lead. In the third quarter they did it again with a four-goal lead. Why can't they keep the momentum going for a full 15 minutes? 29-29 with one quarter to decide who makes the Commonwealth Games netball final.
11.00 Meanwhile Rod Gilmour has got the lowdown on the badminton, where it sounds like the action off the court is as exciting as that on it!
In the end, it was the schedule that did for the Scots. Chris and Gabby Adcock, England’s husband and wife pairing, made full use of a less-than-boisterous atmosphere to see off their gritty Scottish rivals, Imogen Bankier and Robert Blair, to reach Sunday’s Commonwealth Games mixed doubles final.
Chris Adcock stopped just short of saying it was the perfect game in his post-match analysis, but he and wife Gabby, the No.1 seeds, played 35 minutes of faultless badminton, winning 21-14, 21-14.
The Adcocks will now meet another all-English pair in Sunday’s final after Chris Langridge and Heather Oliver beat Peng Soon Chan and Jing Lai Pei, of Malaysia, 21-15, 20-22, 21-13.
“We played a pretty solid game,” said Adcock. “You can never play the perfect game but we were tactically solid and gave them hardly anything. It was a great performance and we managed to get on top of them mentally.
“This was a big occasion with a few different situations flying around with the ex-partners and things. But we came out with a point to prove and we achieved that.
Indeed, this 9am grudge match had so many sub-plots that you needed to get up at dawn just to be filled in on the quartet’s history both on and off court in recent years.
Chris Adcock used to play with his wife before she was unceremoniously axed by team bosses, with Bankier then forming a successful partnership with Chris Adcock that saw them win World Championship silver in 2011. The Adcock-Bankier pair then split after a poor Olympics before the Adcocks, who married last year, reformed as an on-court team.
There was also the infamous Twitter spat prior to the Olympics when Bankier started an after lunch war of words with: “Why can English people not serve?!” It culminated with Jenny Wallwork, a former GB player, telling the Glaswegian to “jog on back to Scotland”. The pair apologised and Bankier later stressed that “it was just banter that got out of control”.
Blair’s history goes back to the Delhi Games when he was omitted from the squad. He had originally switched allegiance to England in 2001 before the Edinburgh-born player was banned from the GB National training centre in Milton Keynes in another low point for British badminton.
And so to this morning’s semi-final start, which simply hindered the Scottish pairing.
The Scots were looking for vociferous local backing, but it never came as the Glaswegians settled into their seats during the first game, rather than create a din.
The English pairing raced out of the blocks, creating space with deft drops and clever lifts leaving the Scottish pair on the back foot and out of position.
The only bit of needle came in the second game when Blair hit Gabby Adcock on the shoulder with a vicious smash.
The only mix-up between this gifted and rhythmic married couple came a point later when Gabby was caught in two minds at the back of the court and hit into the net.
“We came out really well and stuck to the plan,” Gabby Adcock said afterwards. “We managed to keep our cool as it was quite tense out there.
“We knew we were a quicker pair than them so we wanted to use our speed, play soft shots at the same time, moving quick and laying it off in the gaps was our plan and we managed to do that well.
“Maybe they were nervous playing here. I wouldn’t say they were sluggish. We had more games than them.”
“This shows the strength in depth right now in English badminton,” added Chris Adcock of the all-English final.
10.55 And it is an absolute ding-dong in the netball! With two minutes left in the third quarter, it's 29-28 to the English,
10.50 Ben Bloom is at the netball.
Nervy times for England in their netball semi-final against New Zealand. Anna Mayes's side are desperate to end a run of four successive Commonwealth Games semi defeats and opened up a five-goal lead in the second period. New Zealand have won gold at the last two editions though and, inspired by Maria Tutaia, not only clawed their way back but ensured they go in 20-19 ahead at half-time. It would not be overstating things to say this next half is the most important in England netball history.
10.40 Not looking too good in the men's hockey, either, the Aussies are 2-0 ahead of England in the semi.
10.35 Here's the state of the nation(s) in the boxing, from Gareth A Davies:
England has won 7 medals (guaranteed) and has 6 boxers in today’s finals – the most finalists of any nation in the competition
Scotland has won 4 medals and has 2 boxers competing in today’s finals
Wales has won 4 medals
7 of the boxers in today’s finals are members of the GB Boxing squad:
England – Adams, Marshall, Ashfaq, Fitzgerald, Fowler, Joyce
Scotland - Taylor
11 members of the GB Boxing squad have won medals:
7 England – Adams, Marshall, Ashfaq, Fitzgerald, Fowler, Joyce, Maxwell
3 Wales – Cordina, McGoldrick, Williams
1 Scotland – Taylor
Northern Ireland are not part of the GB Boxing squad however they have won 9 medals. Although this is the most overall medals of any home nation, England has more boxers in today finals with 6, Northern Ireland has 4.
NOTE: Micky Yule, the double amputee powerlifter featured in today's Telegraph, competes at 2pm in the men's lightweight category.
10.30 Thrilling stuff in the netball where England were five goals up but the Kiwis are on a storming comeback having scored six without reply to make it 20-19 at half time. England had been on top but went 3 minutes 40 seconds without scoring.
10.25 It will be an all-England final in the mixed doubles badminton, Chris Langridge and Heather Olver are through 2-1 in a quality semi final.
09.50 The Adcocks have put Scottish pair of Blair and Bankier away without too much fuss and will advance to the final of the badminton. In the other semi, England's Langridge and Olver are one game each against the Malaysians.
09.40 This, from Ben Bloom, is a heck of a yarn about how Lynsey Sharp defied the odds to win 800m silver.
At face value Lynsey Sharp winning 800m Commonwealth Games silver was not a huge surprise. Then you hear the back story that ends with her being hooked up to a drip.
She tells it like this: “Last night I went out for dinner because I thought it was just the food in the village I wasn’t enjoying. I ordered a steak, it came to the table and I was like 'I can’t eat that’. I got back to the village and threw up for a few hours. Stephen Maguire [head of Scotland’s coaching team] took me over to the clinic and I was there until 5.30 this morning on a drip. So I didn’t eat. All I’ve eaten today is porridge and scrambled egg.”
There is more. “At 2.30 in the morning I had compression socks on and I couldn’t bend over to take them off it was so bad. I was like 'how the hell am I going to be able to run if I can’t bend over to take my socks off?’ There are two things I’ll never forget: One is being on my hands and knees being sick outside my room with the nurse holding my hair back, Stephen Maguire standing there and four police officers walking away at the sound of me being sick.
“The other is being doubled over trying to take my socks off while [5,000m runner] Stephanie Twell was asleep in the room.”
In 1982 Sharp’s father Cameron won two Commonwealth bronze medals for Scotland in the 100m and 200m. Nine years later he was left with serious brain injuries following a car accident. A long compensation battle followed, he struggled to learn to walk again and he is not usually able to see his daughter race. But he was at Hampden Park on Friday night.
09.20 And then last, but by no means least, we have the relays, always a nerve-jangling, thrilling spectacle. The 4x400m races are at 19.50 (women) and then the men's, where the Scottish were the fastest qualifiers. And then we wrap things up with the 4x100m events, where some fellow called Usain Bolt takes his place in the Jamaica outfit.
09.17 And then, of course, more athletics this evening. The women's pole vault kicks us off, then there's the women's 5000m final, where the home nations are mob-handed. Mercy Cherono of Kenya is the women to beat though. Phillips Idowu goes in the triple jump at 19.10 and there is also the men's 1500m final, and with a host of athletes setting personal bests this season, this should be a hot race.
09.16 Tom Daley is in the 10m platform diving today. There is a preliminary round at 11.38 and then the final at 19.30. Tom and his partner James Denny narrowly missed out on gold yesterday in the men’s 10m synchro platform.
09.15 England's netball women have a semi against New Zealand at 10.00.
09.10 Also, there's badminton, where England are already playing Scotland in the mixed doubles semi-final. And in table tennis, England's 15-year-old Tin-Tin Ho - whose table tennis barmy dad gave her initials TT cos of ,you know, table tennis - goes for mixed doubles gold at 13.15. Her brother, no word of a lie, was named Pong, because: well, ping pong. Their family sounds awesome. Go Tin-Tin! Anyhow, Tin-Tin and partner Liam Pitchford are competing against another English pair, the married Paul and Joanna Drinkhall, so that's one gold in the bag no matter what!
09.05 On the cards today...
Hockey: it's double Aussie action for England's teams. The men play Australia at 10am in the semi, and then England's women - who edged past the Kiwis in a thriller yesterday - go for gold against Oz at 20.15.
Boxing: it's gold medal matches. Nicola Adams gets things underway at 14.00 against Michaela Walsh of N Ireland in womens's flyweight. Northern Ireland's Michael Conlan, who looks a class act, was badly cut by a clash of heads in his semi and Qais Ashfaq of Leeds will be hoping that helps him upset the form book in the men's bantamweight at 15.45. Joseph Joyce goes in men's super-heavy at 21.15.
09.00 Morning all. Tyers here and we're ready for another day of Gamey goodness. There's a lot of sport to enjoy today. Below are a couple of juicy morsels from yesterday.
Gareth A Davies, our para sport guru, writes: Can I urge you to read my interview with Micky Yule?
An extraordinary man; the double amputee powerlifter competes later.
Yule lost both legs in Afghanistan but says he has nothing to whinge about as he is competing for Scotland.
Yule: "People always ask me who inspires me and it’s never really sportsmen. I know many 18 and 19-year-old lads who are triple amputees and they get up in the morning, put all their limbs on and they go out the door. Why am I going to whinge when I’m 35, married and have children, and I’m competing for my country?”

If you didn't catch England's thrilling semi-final win over the Kwis in the women's hockey yesterday, check out Rod Gilmour's piece on the penalty shootout drama.
Maddie Hinch, the England goalkeeper, proved a revelation. The 25-year-old memorised entries from the ‘playbook’ she keeps to document opposition players as she stifled two Black Sticks attempts to herald a remarkable 3-1 victory. This after Katie Glynn had scored with a brilliant, instinctive strike with two minutes to go in normal time to take the semi-final to a shoot-out.
It was not all about Hinch though. Georgie Twigg, Alex Danson and Susie Gilbert also played their part. Their runs from the 23-metre line all ended successfully before Stacey Michelson, sensing another surging run from goal by Hinch, slapped wide of the post.
