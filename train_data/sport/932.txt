Lance Armstrong charity ride at Tour de France 'completely inappropriate and disrespectful', says UCI

Brian Cookson, the president of cycling’s world governing body the UCI, has criticised Lance Armstrong’s decision to ride part of this year’s Tour de France route for charity, labelling it “completely inappropriate and disrespectful”.
Armstrong, who beat testicular cancer as a young rider, has accepted an invitation from former England and Crystal Palace footballer Geoff Thomas to join him on his One Day Ahead ride, which aims to raise money for Cure Leukaemia by completing the entire Tour route a day ahead of the peloton.
Thomas was inspired by Armstrong’s book It’s Not About The Bike when he battled leukaemia himself a decade ago. After riding the Tour route for charity in 2005, Armstrong presented him with the Helen Rollason Award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show. The pair remained in touch even after Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping.

“I’m sure that Geoff Thomas means well, but frankly I think that’s completely inappropriate and disrespectful to the Tour, disrespectful to the current riders, and disrespectful to the UCI and the anti-doping community,” said Cookson, speaking at the Sport Industry Breakfast Club, powered by CWM FX. “I think Lance Armstrong would be well advised not to take part in that.”
Asked whether the charitable aspect of the ride, and the extra publicity it was likely to raise for Cure Leukaemia, outweighed the negatives, Cookson said: “You know the ‘charity justification’ was used quite a lot through Lance Armstrong’s career, wasn’t it? And that got us into all sorts of trouble. There are a lot of other ways that people can do good works and raise money for charity. I only know what I’ve read in the media but it looks perhaps as if Armstrong was persuaded into it. And if he was, well, it’s not a good judgment. I think I’d ask him not to do it.”
Sir Dave Brailsford, Team Sky principal, has already criticised Armstrong’s involvement, drawing a caustic response from the American on Twitter. “Give me @GeoffThomasGTF and he can have @ServaisKnaven,” Armstrong wrote, referring to Sky’s sporting director, Servais Knaven, who has recently been the subject of renewed allegations regarding his past.

Thomas later released a statement saying that Armstrong “genuinely” wanted to help improve the situation of those with blood cancer. “I understand that some people will find it hard to accept Armstrong’s support but my take is a simple one,” he wrote. “If Armstrong’s involvement… can help save one more life then surely that can only be a good thing.”
Cookson also revealed that the UCI would test the running of mixed-gender cycling events in Aigle this week ahead of a possible revamp of Olympic cycling disciplines for Tokyo 2020 as the IOC looks to cap the number of events and athletes but open up the Games to more sports.

“We’re going to look at a mixed team sprint; two men, two women. They can go in whatever order they want but they each have to do one lap,” Cookson said. “We’re also thinking about a mixed Madison. Again, that is going to have to be very carefully managed given the different power, and different strengths in the arms and legs. You have to look at penalties otherwise the male rider stays in all the time. A relay time trial on the road could work certainly.
“It was an idea of Thomas Bach himself. I spoke with him in Bangkok and when the president of the IOC says something, you take it seriously. We need to keep an open mind.”
