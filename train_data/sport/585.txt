Scotland defender Russell Martin issues warning that his team are a better footballing side than England

Norwich City defender Russell Martin claims that Scotland are a better footballing side than England, to the extent that his English friends have confessed they would rather watch the Scots than the players assembled by Roy Hodgson.
On Tuesday night at Celtic Park they will be able to make a more studied assessment of the respective merits of both sides.
Martin, born and raised in Brighton, qualifies for a representative career through his Scottish father and is in line to win his 16th cap against the English.
It is a match he hopes will cement the positive impression his peers have of the progress Scotland have made under Gordon Strachan.
“To be honest I have had so many texts from friends and fellow players who say they genuinely enjoy watching Scotland more than England at the minute,” the 28-year-old said. “That is a massive compliment. That is true. A lot of my friends have said that. They all watch our games, if I’m involved, and they really like how we play.

“I’ve had loads of compliments about our team and we are enjoying that. It shows you how far this team has come.
“Winning [against the Republic of Ireland on Friday] puts us on a real high. Obviously, there is still pressure on us to win against England but we had a day to enjoy that result before getting back to work on Sunday.
“Now we can look forward to Tuesday and why not beat them as well and really end this year on a high?”
Martin was part of the side which, 15 months ago, lost 3-2 at Wembley after taking the lead twice and he is of the opinion that the Scots owe the Auld Enemy one after that result.
“Yes! We should have got a result there and we were really disappointed not to,” he said. “That is probably the one result – along with Germany – than rankles most with myself and, probably, the rest of the lads and the manager as well.
“We definitely should have got a result at Wembley. It wasn’t to be but, hopefully, they we will be in for a right game up here.
“Our performance [at Wembley] deserved something. But Rickie Lambert had a free header from inside the box because we were not organised enough.
“He’d just come on as a substitute and they scored from that, which was really disappointing.
“But we are a different team now. We are a long way down the line from then, further in the manager’s tenure. They will come up here and they will know they are in a tough game.
“I think last time at Wembley they were surprised by how well we played and by how we had a go. They probably expected us to sit and defend all game but we don’t do that under this manager.
“We are different team to what we were then and, with the momentum and belief we have in the squad now, we will give anyone a good game.”
Martin has no doubt that the match will be just as competitive as the (often overly) physical tussle against the Irish.
“It’s Scotland v England in font of 60,000 fans so there is no option other than for it to be intense,” he said. “Whether or not it will be the same for them, I don’t know. But I am sure after five minutes they will realise it.
“Under our manager, there is no let-up. We got a great result against Ireland and we want to go out and finish on a high.”
England top their Euro 2016 qualifying section with maximum points but Martin argues that the clash at Parkhead will provide a more rigorous examination of their credentials. “On paper they don’t have the toughest group in the world and this is a game they are probably looking forward to,” he said. “Some of the boys down the road will feel like that. We all want to get one over on each other.
“After Friday we don’t want to end on a downer on Tuesday. We want to finish the job off and go into the New Year in a good way, with Scotland in a great position to qualify from our group and giving the fans something against England.
