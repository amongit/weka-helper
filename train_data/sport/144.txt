Viola, Berkman among 8 selected to college baseball hall
LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Former major league All-Stars Frank Viola and Lance Berkman are among eight players and coaches selected for the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.
Viola went 26-2 at St. John's before going on to a 15-year career in the majors that included winning the AL Cy Young Award in 1988. Berkman, a switch-hitter who hit 366 home runs in 15 big league seasons, was the national player of the year at Rice in 1997.
Three other former major leaguers are among the selections: pitcher Al Holland (North Carolina A&T), outfielder Mike Kelly (Arizona State) and outfielder Rick Reichardt (Wisconsin).
Pitcher Joe Arnold (Miami-Dade and Arizona State) and coaches Larry Hays (Lubbock Christian and Texas Tech) and Bill Holowaty (Eastern Connecticut State) also are among the group of inductees.
