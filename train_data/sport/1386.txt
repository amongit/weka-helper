Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta thinks they can knock Barcelona out of the Champions League and reignite their Premier League bid in the process.
City lost 1-0 to Burnley on Saturday, are six points behind Chelsea, and go to the Nou Camp on Wednesday needing to overturn a 2-1 deficit in the last 16.
"It's not going to be easy, but nothing is impossible in football. You have to be ready for these moments," Argentine Zabaleta said.
"Things can change on games like this."
On the back of defeat to the Clarets, he added: "It's good that we have this game after just three days. We need to recover well, go to Barcelona and see what we can do. Hopefully we can do it."
Luis Suarez scored twice at the Etihad Stadium in the first leg, with Sergio Aguero giving City hope.
Zabaleta takes confidence from Paris St-Germain, who scored late goals to beat Chelsea, and Schalke, who came within a goal of knocking out Real Madrid after losing the first leg 2-0.
"If you look at the game Real Madrid played against Schalke and the same with Chelsea and PSG, it shows anything can happen in football," he said.
"That's why we need to go to Barca with confidence, with belief and try to do our best to win that game.
"We have played in this competition for four years. It's a competition we want to make progress in."
