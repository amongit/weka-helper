It comes just days after Arsène Wenger said he was interested in the Bayern Munich playmaker, who would effectively replace Alex Song in the heart of the Gunners' midfield.
Arsenal valued 26-year-old Gustavo at around £14m but appear to have been unwilling to go much higher, allowing Wolfsburg manager Klaus Allofs to submit his winning bid.
The Bundesliga club have been long-term admirers of the Brazil international.
Arsenal also had an £18 million offer for Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender rejected earlier in the summer, and have lost out on Toulouse midfielder Etienne Capoue, who is set to join rivals Tottenham in an £8.6 million deal today.
Wenger is now under increasing pressure to secure more signings, as his only capture so far has been France youth international striker Yaya Sanogo on a free transfer from Auxerre.

Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal's chief executive, has previously said the club has enough funds to secure top players and should aim to strengthen the squad.
