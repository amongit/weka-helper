West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster has been ruled out for at least four weeks with a knee injury.
The England international, 31, damaged cartilage during West Brom's Premier League win over Stoke on Saturday.
Boaz Myhill will start against Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday, with former academy player Jack Rose, 20, deputising for him.
"It's rotten news for Ben because he's been so consistent," West Brom head coach Tony Pulis said.
"He kept seven clean sheets in 10 games but we have a very able man to step forward in Boaz, who has performed well when he's come into the team."
Foster will likely miss Premier League matches against Manchester City, QPR and Leicester City.
He will also be absent for England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on 27 March and the international friendly against Italy in Turin four days later.
"We've got the international break coming up, which I hope will give our medical team the chance to work on Ben's rehab and we will reassess later," Pulis continued.
