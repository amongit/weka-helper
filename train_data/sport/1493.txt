London Welsh have appointed Rowland Phillips as their new head coach as a replacement for Justin Burnell, who has left the Premiership's bottom side.
Welsh, who were promoted in the summer, have not won a single game in any competition this season and will almost certainly return to the Championship.
Phillips joined the club as defence coach at the end of 2014 and was on Wales's 2007 World Cup coaching staff.
"I am very proud to be leading the coaching of this great club," he said.
"It's been a very tough season in the Premiership, trying to play with a squad built on an uneven financial playing field. But the boys are determined to rescue something from this season."
Phillips, who also played for London Welsh, won 10 caps for Wales as a back-row forward and also won caps for the Wales and Great Britain rugby league teams.
In 2003 he took over from Lyn Jones as coach of Neath RFC, a team he led to four Welsh Premiership titles in successive years and three cup final wins.
He has also worked as defence coach at Ospreys, and as head coach at Ebbw Vale and at Italian clubs Viadana and Aironi Rugby in the Pro 12.
