Tim Tebow Worked Out With The Eagles, And Everyone Lost Their Minds
March Madness is here, and for a brief moment on Monday, it had nothing to do with basketball.
NFL analyst Adam Schefter broke news the Philadelphia Eagles might resurrect Tim Tebow's career after the former quarterback was reported to be working out at the team's facilities Monday:
Well, how about this: Former Broncos and Patriots QB Tim Tebow is working out today for the Philadelphia Eagles, a source confirmed.

Schefter reports the Eagles aren't planning to sign Tebow at the moment, though he left the door open to it still being a possibility.
As expected, reports of renewed interest in Tebow, a former quarterback for the Broncos and the Patriots, took the Internet by storm, and plenty of Eagles coach Chip Kelly-bashing ensued:

Courting Tebow is just the latest in Kelly's already controversial offseason, leading some to speculate the coach is just trolling everyone.
