Hull City in legal talks in bid to conclude name-change process
A long-running campaign has been run by Hull City supporters against the name change to Tigers

Hull City's lawyers are in talks with the Football Association as the Premier League club seeks to conclude a bid to change its name to Hull Tigers.
The FA Council's decision to reject the club's initial application was set aside on Monday.
Hull were told they could bid again for a name change next season; the FA want that bid submitted before 1 April.
Hull believe their original application should be reconsidered following the findings of the arbitration panel.
The club therefore do not intend to go through the process for a second time.
In turn, the FA are adamant they have nothing to consider until a second bid is lodged and are of the belief that the arbitration panel's verdict effectively annuls the original process.
The Premier League club's legal team are now attempting to resolve the impasse after they were told they would need to re-apply in the next fortnight if they want the case to be considered for the 2015-16 season.
Hull owner Assem Allam has put the club up for sale and that will remain the case unless he is successful in his attempt to alter the club's name to Hull Tigers.
