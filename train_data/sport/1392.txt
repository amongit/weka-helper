Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen is suspended for Wednesday's Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Dundee United.
Adam Matthews returns from an ankle injury, but Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven are cup-tied and Charlie Mulgrew and Mikael Lustig remain out.
United striker Nadir Ciftci returns from suspension.
However, defenders Paul Dixon and Sean Dillon serve bans and miss out for Jackie McNamara's side.
The match will be the third of four successive meetings between the two sides with the original Scottish Cup tie preceding Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, which Celtic won 2-0. The pair meet again in Saturday's league encounter.
Celtic manager Ronny Deila: "If you are good at something you have to continue doing what you are good at, not start doing something else.
"We want to build on what we are good at and do that even better.
"I'm not into surprising opponents so much. I want them to fear us for what we are - they know what's coming and don't know how to handle it. That's our goal in the future."
Dundee United midfielder John Rankin: "We will go to Parkhead believing there is no reason why we can't get into the next round of the cup.
"We were not out-played at Hampden and that gives us confidence because we know that gap is not that big. It's just these fine margins you have to overcome.
"We believe we are due that first trophy as a group and that is bringing us closer together. Hopefully if we can just get that wee bit of luck we can get the win at Celtic Park."
