Euro 2016 qualifiers: Wales recall Sam Vokes for Israel trip
Southampton-born Sam Vokes made his Wales debut in 2008

Venue: Sammy Ofer Stadium. Haifa Date: 28 March, 2015 Kick-off: 17:00 BST
Coverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and the BBC Sport website
Striker Sam Vokes returns to Chris Coleman's Wales squad to face Israel in a Euro 2016 qualifier on 28 March.
Burnley's Vokes, 25, suffered cruciate ligament damage and was out for nine months before returning in the Premier League on Boxing Day.
However, Coleman says Vokes won't play the full game against unbeaten Group B leaders Israel.
"Sam's probably not ready to start and do a full 90 minutes. I don't think so," he said.
"It's going to take time because after an injury like that it doesn't just happen overnight.
"He needs to trust himself and trust his injury. [But] It's great to have him back. It's a big positive for us because he's been out a long time."
Fellow front-man Simon Church is also included after overcoming a shoulder injury, but Wales will be without defender James Chester.
The 25-year-old Hull City centre-back Chester dislocated a shoulder in January and is ruled out of the trip to Haifa.
Church missed November's goalless draw in Belgium because of his injury.
Chester has played every minute of Wales' qualifying games so far.
Coleman will be without three more injured players for the Group B game.
They are Newcastle full-back Paul Dummett (knee), Fulham midfielder George Williams (knee) and Wigan midfielder Emyr Huws (ankle).
Israel top the group having won all three of their games so far.
Wales are a point behind in second with two wins and two draws from their four games.
Goalkeepers: Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Owain Fon Williams (Tranmere Rovers), Daniel Ward (Liverpool).
Defence: Ashley Williams (Swansea City), James Collins (West Ham United), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Gunter (Reading), Neil Taylor (Swansea City), Samuel Ricketts (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Ashley Richards (Swansea City), Adam Henley (Blackburn Rovers).
Midfield: Joe Allen (Liverpool), Joe Ledley (Crystal Palace), Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal), David Vaughan (Nottingham Forest), David Edwards (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Shaun MacDonald (AFC Bournemouth).
Attack: David Cotterill (Birmingham City), Hal Robson-Kanu (Reading), Tom Lawrence (Leicester City), Gareth Bale (Real Madrid), Simon Church (Charlton Athletic), Sam Vokes (Burnley).
