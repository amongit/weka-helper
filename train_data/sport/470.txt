The Britons are part of the Race2Recovery team, which has been raising funds for Forces' charities since 2011 and is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge.
The men have been named as Justin Birchall, 40, a civilian volunteer, Lee Townsend, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer and Gulf War and Falklands war veteran, and retired Army Major John Winskill, 42. Their injuries have been described as “non-life-threatening”.
The crash happened when their vehicle, a Land Rover Defender, was travelling in convoy on day five of the rally in the Peruvian town of Tacna, near the Chilean border.
The taxis were carrying six and four people respectively. Organisers said one of the taxis collided head-on with the Land Rover, while the second one rolled several times in an attempt to avoid the accident.
Two people in the first taxi were killed as a result of the crash. Team leader Captain Tony Harris said the 28-strong team, which has celebrity and royal backing in the form of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, had unanimously agreed to continue the challenge with their two remaining race vehicles.

"The team decided before we even started that we would continue our endeavour,” said Harris, 31, who had his lower leg amputated while serving in Afghanistan. “This is obviously a huge shock but we know that we have the blessing of the injured. They want the team to finish.”
The rally began in Lima on Saturday and ends in Santiago, Chile, on Jan 20.
