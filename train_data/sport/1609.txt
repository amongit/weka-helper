Here's How Michigan Students Feel About Athletic Director Dave Brandon Resigning
While complaints about former University of Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon may have varied, the reactions to his resignation on campus were generally unanimous, according to one student.
"I think that, generally, people are happy, whatever your reason is," Kalyani Sharma said on HuffPost Live on Friday, "because your football saturday mornings are ruined, because of your pride in the longstanding team or whether you're really upset with how the voice of women is completely just put a damper on on campus and it's not taken into account. There are different reasons for people's opinions, but for the most part I think people are happy."
Before Brandon resigned on Friday, students had planned to distribute over 2,000 t-shirts at the Wolverines' homecoming game that called for his termination.
