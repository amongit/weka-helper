Rugby is the best medicine for gangly adolescents

Children who do not want to play rugby should be let off because it’s so dangerous, a top neurosurgeon says. I wish he’d been around when I was a boy. As a weedy and un-coordinated child, I hated compulsory games. Games to me meant the face-scorching humiliation of having a sadistic teacher highlight my spindly frame and gawkiness before a pitiless mob of classmates. PE was even worse.
Aesthete-friendly activities should be offered as an alternative, I thought: art, for instance, instead of rugby on a cold, damp afternoon. But gradually I have come to see the point of sport at school. It uses up the mass of surplus energy that adolescents have, encourages unselfish collaboration, and promotes health.
I once taught rugby, in a manner of speaking, but there could not have been anyone less qualified. This was at a prep school where I was a junior master before university.
We’d trot down to a field beside the spinney. I bought a book called Rugby: Know the Game and shouted “tackle low” at intervals because it sounded authentic. Presumably tackling low is safer but it was the only concession to safety. No mouthguards or ear protectors then. In emergencies – if the game was falling apart or the boys were misbehaving – I had a back-up slogan: “Scrum down”. This would interrupt the action to allow me to work out what to do next.
The children in those afternoon games by the spinney seemed too small and light to do each other real harm. They were all the same age, around nine (the same as my son, incidentally, who plays tag rugby; instead of tackling they pull off velcro strips). The neurosurgeon had a point when he said that youngsters should not be forced to play rugby with older boys – heavy enough to crush bones, snap or wrench limbs.

But compared with now we had only the most rudimentary conception of the risks of sport 30 years ago – and perhaps that was no bad thing. The more you are aware of the dangers, the less you are able to throw yourself into it with abandonment – and nothing worth doing is free of risk.

Porridge aids long life, says a Harvard study. The beta-glucan in oats lowers cholesterol. Of course it does: you can just tell that porridge is good for you, can’t you.
But which kind? Made of rolled oats? Or nutty pinhead oatmeal, which takes longer to cook (unless you make your porridge overnight in the bottom oven of the Aga, in which case it doesn’t matter)?
And what cooking agent to use: water or milk? Salt, or not? As for the fashion for adding jam – that is an abomination, surely.
(On the other hand, berries work in Dr Bircher-Benner’s recipe for muesli, which is sort-of cold porridge: oats steeped in fruit juice with grated apple, yogurt and perhaps nuts stirred in.)
These knotty questions need to be answered, of course, but the vital one is this: how much thick Jersey cream can you add before it completely cancels out the cholesterol-lowering properties of the beta-glucan?

We have acquired a vinegar mother. This is a strangely beautiful, harmless organism made of cellulose that has appeared, as they do, in a bottle of balsamic vinegar. It looks like an ear suspended in the dark liquid. As the name suggests, it’s a “starter” – you add it to wine or cider to produce vinegar.
The trouble is, our ear is bigger than the neck of the bottle – so how will we ever remove it? Vinegar mothers are new to me, but there is a whole community of enthusiasts out there, with mothers for sale online. The world of vinegar mothers awaits to be explored. For now, though, I will stick to making bread.

There’s a remarkable film out now on DVD called Locke. Steven Knight directed it, and it stars Tom Hardy pretty much single-handed. That’s the extraordinary thing about it – the action consists of Hardy driving his BMW down the motorway from Birmingham to London at night, while talking on his hands-free phone, in a (vain) effort to save his marriage and reach a hospital where an anxious woman is about to give birth, while at the same time organising “the biggest concrete pour in Europe, outside of nuclear and military projects”.
What it shows is how a skilled director can ramp up the tension with great economy of means. It reminded me of Spielberg’s early TV movie, Duel, in which Dennis Weaver plays a lone driver pursued by a sinister lorry. Locke is nail-biting stuff: do try it.
