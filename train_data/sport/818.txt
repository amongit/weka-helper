England on £2 million jackpot if they win Six Nations

The England squad will share a bonus of almost £370,000 if they win the RBS Six Nations title on Saturday as part of a potential shared jackpot of more than £2 million, The Daily Telegraph can disclose.
England are favourites to win the championship as they go into the final round at the top of the Six Nations table, ahead of Ireland and Wales on points difference, with each of the three sides having won three games and lost one.
Stuart Lancaster’s side, who face France at Twickenham on Saturday, enjoy a points-difference advantage of four over of Ireland, who travel to Murrayfield to face Scotland, and 25 on Wales, who play Italy in Rome.

England, who have not lost a Six Nations match at Twickenham since being beaten by Wales in February 2012, also have the advantage of playing France in the final match of ‘Super Saturday’ so that Lancaster’s side will have the benefit of knowing exactly what they have to do to win the trophy.
Should England go on to clinch what would be their first Six Nations title since 2011, it would trigger a Rugby Football Union bonus payment of £368,000 to be shared between the 23-man squad on a pro-rata basis, equating to a bonus of £16,000 for any player who has been in every match-day squad.
That performance-related bonus (a Grand Slam would have been worth £600,000) comes on top of individual match fees of just over £15,000 per player in the match-day squad. The £15,000 is broken down roughly into a £7,000 match fee, £7,000 for image rights and a £1,000 training fee as part of a deal that makes England the best-paid players in world rugby.

The latest pay agreement dispenses with previous rewards for one-off victories, with an increased match fee and tournament win bonus reflecting the desire to reward sustained success. Any player who has played in every match of the championship would be in line for a total payment of £91,000 if England were to clinch the championship on Saturday – a total Rugby Football Union payout of £2,093,000.
When England last won the Six Nations, in 2011, each player was on a match fee of £8,000, topped up by a win bonus of £4,000. The squad bonus on offer for winning the Grand Slam was £500,000, with the title win thought to be worth half that.

England’s current payment structure contrasts that of Wales and Ireland, who both have either large win bonuses per match or a more lucrative squad bonus for winning the title. Wales are understood to pay their players a match fee of £5,300 per game, with an image-rights payment of £1,500 per player per campaign, but the squad win bonus on offer is much higher than England’s, with £1,035,000 on offer should Warren Gatland’s side take the title. That equates to a bonus of £45,000 per player which, on top of match fees of £26,500, would give each Wales player a total payment of £71,500.
Should Joe Schmidt’s side win the Six Nations, it is understood the Ireland players will share an extra squad bonus of €230,000 (£165,000), equating to a total of €44,000 (£32,000) for those players who have been in every match-day squad of the championship.

England are poised to make one change to the starting XV who defeated Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham last weekend with Geoff Parling, the Leicester lock, expected to replace Bath’s Dave Attwood in the second row. Tom Youngs, of Leicester, had also been pressing hard for a start at hooker but it is understood that the Northampton captain Dylan Hartley will retain his place.
Parling, who missed the start of the championship after sustaining a knee injury in a Champions Cup match for Leicester against Ulster in January, enjoyed an impressive cameo off the bench against Scotland. His experience as a line-out operator could prove crucial to England’s hopes of maintaining their Six Nations winning run against France at Twicken­ham that stretches back to 2005.
Attwood, who is expected to drop to the bench, has been one of the most improved players of England’s campaign but Parling’s experience and line-out expertise will also allow Courtney Lawes to be given a wider licence to cause havoc with his defensive hits.
