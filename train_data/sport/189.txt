Soccer-Atletico win shootout to knock Leverkusen out
MADRID, March 17 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid kept alive their dream of a second consecutive Champions League final appearance when they beat Bayer Leverkusen on penalties on Tuesday to claim a place in the last eight.
The Bundesliga side won last month's first leg in Germany 1-0 and a goal from Atletico midfielder Mario Suarez in the 27th minute of the return match left the teams locked at 1-1 after extra time at the Calderon.
Both sides failed with two penalties before Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling fired his effort over the crossbar to give Atletico a 3-2 shootout victory.
