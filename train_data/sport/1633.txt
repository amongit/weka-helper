Hampton Coach Jokes He Has 'Jesus On Speed Dial' For Help Against Kentucky
Coach Edward Joyner Jr. and his Hampton University Pirates won't be the only basketball team that might need divine intervention to beat top-rated Kentucky. But Joyner did something about it.
After his team beat Manhattan on Tuesday to advance to a date with the unbeaten Wildcats in the NCAA Tournament, Joyner was asked how difficult the challenge of playing Kentucky may be. In a lighthearted moment, the coach pulled out his cell phone and told reporters, "I told you I had Jesus on speed dial."
"Hey Jesus. First of all, you can't play," Joyner began the conversation. It was a pretty funny routine, with Jesus ultimately hanging up on the coach. "I guess he'll get back to me," Joyner quipped.
