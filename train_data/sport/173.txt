Man accused of flying drones over stadiums to go to court
LONDON (AP) -- A man has been summoned to appear in a British court on charges that he flew drones over soccer stadiums during matches.
Police say Nigel Wilson is accused of flying a ''small unmanned surveillance aircraft'' over seven stadiums, including the homes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.
The 42-year-old Wilson is also said to have failed to maintain direct, unaided and visual contact with a drone at Buckingham Palace and the House of Parliament in London.
London's Metropolitan Police says Wilson has been summoned to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on April 16.
