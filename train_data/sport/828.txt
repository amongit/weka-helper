Premiership rugby will remain on BT Sport until 2021 after it signed a new four-year contract for the exclusive rights to England’s top flight.
Telegraph Sport has learnt that Premier Rugby and BT are poised to announce an extension of their existing deal, which will represent a huge windfall for English clubs.
It is understood the new contract is worth far in excess of the £152 million agreement the pair signed in 2012, which controversially included handing BT the rights to Premiership teams’ European matches.
Those are not part of the 2017-21 deal, which includes up to 80 games per season, up from a maximum of 69, as well as the Singha Premiership Rugby 7s Series.

It should nevertheless give English clubs significant extra spending power and enable them to attract and retain more of the world’s best players.
That may include members of the England squad, who may otherwise have been tempted by a big payday abroad after this year’s World Cup.
Overseas-based players are not usually selected by the Rugby Football Union and the new television deal could end the club-versus-country dilemma faced by many.
Premier Rugby awarded BT the rights without going out to tender to the likes of Sky Sports, having forged a strong relationship with the new broadcaster, particularly during the war over European club rugby.
The governing body – which is considering expanding the Premiership to 14 teams and scrapping relegation from 2016 – gambled two-and-a-half years ago on cutting its ties with Sky and signing an exclusive deal with what was a non-existent network.

It has been pleased with both attendances and ratings during its first season-and-a-half with BT, whose coverage includes expert analysis from 2003 World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson.
For BT, retaining the Premiership contract was crucial following repeated setbacks in its bid to expand its rugby portfolio.
It lost out to Sky for the rights to England’s autumn internationals and overseas tours and maintaining a presence in the sport beyond 2017 will be essential if it decides to bid to show Six Nations games.
Tournament organisers have already indicated they are ready to consider offers from pay-TV networks for the 2018 championship and beyond.
BT’s deal also comes a month after it extended its contract to show Premier League football until 2019, paying £960 million for 126 games over three seasons.
That represented its first major sports outlay since it snatched Champions League football from Sky Sports 18 months ago.
Since then, it has watched its bitter rival wrap up more than 30 separate rights deals.
