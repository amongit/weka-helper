Director of rugby Dean Richards has signed a new three-year contract with Newcastle Falcons that will run until the summer of 2018.
He has overseen steady progress since taking charge at Kingston Park in 2012, leading the club from the Championship and securing top flight status.
This season's squad reached the last eight of the European Challenge Cup.
"We are building a strong and sustainable club here at Newcastle," the former England back row said.
"I'm particularly pleased at how the players, coaching staff and off-field staff have bought into our vision."
The former Leicester Tigers and Harlequins boss arrived at Newcastle following a three-year ban for his involvement in a fake blood-injury incident.
He has rebuilt his coaching career at the Falcons alongside former Tigers team-mate John Wells and attack coach Dave Walder, with improved try and win figures in 2014-15.
"We are very pleased that Dean has agreed to continue as director of rugby for the next three years," owner Semore Kurdi said.
"As the most successful director of rugby in Premiership history he brings tremendous experience, knowledge as well as a winning mentality to the club.
"He is central to the continued growth of Newcastle Falcons over what will be a very exciting period for the club game in England."
Academy products such as Simon Hammersley, Scott Wilson and Chris Harris have all thrived under Richards' stewardship, with homegrown talent used extensively in European and domestic competition this term.
"His work in bringing through quality, young English-qualified players is already starting to have an impact performance wise for the first team," Kurdi added.
"Similarly the culture that he has instilled throughout the team and coaching staff is first class and is something will continue to develop and benefit Newcastle Falcons moving forward."
