Hull have been charged with failing to control their players during Saturday's goalless draw at Leicester.
It relates to an incident in the 68th minute when Hull defender Alex Bruce was booked and a number of players crowded around referee Jonathan Moss.
The club has until 18:00 GMT on Monday to respond to the charge.
The charge comes a day after Football Association chairman Greg Dyke expressed his concern at the increase in players surrounding referees.
Players from both sides approached Moss after Bruce's heavy challenge on Riyad Mahrez, in which the City defender appeared to play the ball.
Hull boss Steve Bruce said after the game: "There's a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek ... I saw everyone [Leicester players] surround Alex for a red card for his challenge."
Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone was sent off for two bookable offences in the same match.
"There wasn't a nasty challenge in the game yet we've had five yellow cards and a sending off. I never saw that coming," said Bruce.
