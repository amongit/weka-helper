Where can I watch the game and when does it start? The Champions League match kicks off at 7.45pm on Tueday and will be broadcast live on ITV1 from 7.30. Highlights will follow on ITV1 at 11.05 alongside tonight's other last-16 meeting between Atlético Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen.
Team news
Monaco midfielders Jérémy Toulalan, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco and Geoffrey Kondogbia all return to the squad after missing their comfortable 3-0 defeat of Bastia on Friday night. The trio missed the Ligue 1 win through injury, but have since returned to training.
Gabriel Paulista, the Arsenal defender, has recovered from a hamstring problem and has travelled to Monaco as has captain Mikel Arteta who has returned to training following an ankle injury. While both are not expected to start, Arsène Wenger may bring either off the bench.
Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (hamstring) remains out, along with Jack Wilshere (ankle) while midfielder Tomas Rosicky was another not part of the European match squad after illness.
Monaco's probable starting XI (4-2-3-1): Subasic; Raggi, Carvalho, Abdennour, Kurzawa; Fabinho, Kondogbia; Dirar, Moutinho, Martial; Berbatov. Arsenal 's probable starting XI (4-2-3-1): Ospina; Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Coquelin, Ramsey; Cazorla, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud.

Betting odds (after 90 minutes)
Monaco to win: 11/5 Draw: 23/10 Arsenal to win: 13/10 Monaco to qualify for quarter-finals: 1/10 Arsenal to qualify for quarter-finals: 5/1 *All odds correct as of 10am on Tuesday, March 17

Three reasons Monaco will win - Dimitar Berbatov. As we saw in the first leg the former Tottenham Hotspur forward has still got what it takes and if the Bulgarian is given in inch of space can prove deadly. - Monaco's obdurate defence has been breached just twice in the Champions League this season, ranking alongside European champions Real Madrid as the meanest. - Wenger has never – never – beaten Monaco in seven attempts. The former Monaco manager has managed just four draws and three defeats.
Three reasons Arsenal will win - Pace, pace, pace. With Monaco's veteran centre-back Ricardo Carvalho expected to return to their starting line-up, Wenger will be hoping on Alexis Sánchez's pace can test the 36-year-old. While Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott are expected to start on the bench, either can be brought on to pressurise the Portuguese. - Wenger, Arsenal's French manager, has an exceptional record against his countrymen and his club have never lost to a club from France in any knock-out stage in European competition. The north Londoners have eliminated French clubs five times previously. - Arsenal have nothing to lose. After the humiliation of the 3-1 home defeat most observers – and a large number of their supporters – have already written off Arsenal, giving them freedom to roam, express themselves and play liquid football. Maybe.

One intriguing stat... Only one club – Real Madrid, the 10-time winners of the European Cup – have a better winning ratio at home out of those clubs with more than two appearances in the Champions League. Monaco have prevailed in an incredible 76 per cent of their Games at Stade Louis II.
Our prediction: 2-1
