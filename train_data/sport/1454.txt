Leicestershire have signed experienced batsman Mark Cosgrove on a two-year deal and appointed him captain.
The South Australia left-hander, 30, holds a British passport and will be available for all formats of the game.
Cosgrove, who has played three one-day internationals for Australia, will link up with new head coach Andrew McDonald.
"Mark is a player I know well from my time at South Australia and Sydney Thunder. He is a destructive batsman who can bat anywhere," McDonald said.
"His aggressive approach will be welcome in all formats. Mark has a terrific career record and his leadership abilities will be of great value, as well as the runs that he will score."
Mark Cosgrove made his highest first-class score of 233 for Glamorgan against Derbyshire at Derby in 2006 - it remains the county's record score by an overseas player.
The left-hander was a prolific run-scorer in the county game during three full seasons at Glamorgan in 2006, 2009 and 2010, and also played T20 cricket for them in 2011.
Cosgrove scored 2,823 runs, including 10 centuries, at an average of 52.27 in 60 first-class innings for the Welsh county.
Pace bowler Clint Mackay, also from Australia, and New Zealand all-rounder Grant Elliott will fill the county's overseas player positions this summer.
Meanwhile, batsman Ned Eckersley has been named vice-captain for the 2015 season.
