NFL Draft 2012 Round 4 Results: Kirk Cousins, Joe Adams Among Picks
Every round of the NFL Draft usually has a standout pick. Sometimes that pick is a player who has fallen much further than expected. In other rounds, it's a player that many believe was taken too high (cough.. Bruce Irvin.. cough).
The third day didn't disappoint, as the fourth round started off with a surprise. Just two days after seemingly anointing Robert Griffin III as the face of the franchise, the Washington Redskins picked another quarterback.
Before the draft, the Redskins paid a heavy price to trade up in order to select RG3 with the No. 2 overall selection. So everyone was caught off guard when they became first team since 1989 to spend two picks in the first four rounds on quarterbacks. Will there be a quarterback controversy in the national's capital? ESPN's Ron Jaworski certainly thinks so, saying during the television broadcast that the Redskins caused more problems than they solved.
Other notable selections in the fourth round were Joe Adams of Arkansas -- selected by Carolina at No. 104 overall -- who happened to pull off one of the best highlights of the 2011 season. Denver picked up a blocker for new quarterback Peyton Manning with center Phillip Blake out of Baylor and the Bills stuck to defense again by taking linebacker Nigel Bradham out of Florida State.
