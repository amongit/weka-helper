'We usually see each other at our worst; no makeup, knackered.' GB hockey women given fashion makeover

Ten of the Great Britain women's hockey squad swapped the monotony of training for an "edgy" fashion shoot in east London last week.
The players, based at Bisham Abbey, were photographed as part of England Hockey's bid to target a new audience ahead of a key year for both men's and women's squads, which includes Olympic qualification and the EuroHockey Championships at Lee Valley in August.

Three hairstylists, one of whom works with singer Katy Perry, were on hand to give squad members a taste of the fashion world at a studio in Dalston.
"It is a very different way to showcase us as sports' women," said Alex Danson, the GB forward.

"It's a nice combination of athletic bodies in clothes we don't wear for training, in fact never wear for training."
Lily Owsley, Danson's fellow forward, said: "We literally see each other at our worst; no make up and knackered, so it was really nice to put some on, get treated well and looked after."
An England Hockey spokesperson said that it was "very seldom" that the squad received such pampering.
"They really enjoyed it and the support from Investec has allowed us to have this opportunity," she said.
"With the clothing, shoot and styling, we are looking to appeal to a younger audience."
