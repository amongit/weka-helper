Andy Murray falls to old foe Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals of Indian Wells

Andy Murray was comprehensively beaten by Novak Djokovic in the last four of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Saturday.
The British number one had been impressive en route to a first Masters 1000 semi-final since his win in Miami two years ago, but he had no answer against the world number one.
Murray beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon final in 2013 but has not done so since, Djokovic extending his head-to-head advantage to 17-8 with a sixth successive win.
The pair met last month in the final of the Australian Open where Djokovic once again came out on top - although Murray appeared to be frustrated during the match with the Serb's cramping.
However Murray insisted before Saturday's meeting that there were no issues between the two.
Djokovic will now face either Milos Raonic or Roger Federer in the final.
