Six Nations 2015: Wales 23-16 Ireland Highlights
16 March 2015 Last updated at 07:56
Former England and Scotland coach Andy Robinson thinks Wales will not get out of their pool at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
Warren Gatland's side have been drawn against hosts England, Australia, Uruguay and Fiji.
In spite of Wales' dramatic 23-16 Six Nations win over Ireland, Robinson thinks they will struggle to qualify.
"Australia will get out of the group and I believe England will," Robinson told BBC Wales Sport's Scrum V.
"I think Australia, as long as they stay fit, particularly their front five and the way they play the game, they'll get out of the pool."
Wales play England on Saturday, 26 September and Australia on Saturday, 10 October. Both matches are at Twickenham.
Former England flanker Robinson, who is now director of rugby at English Championship side Bristol, said Gatland's team - who finished fourth in the 2011 tournament - will find it tough.
"They are under huge pressure to perform," he said.
"Wales don't score enough tries, and bonus points may come into the mix."
Wales great Jonathan Davies also expects Australia to go though from the pool, but says Wales can beat England if they can reproduce the level of performance that saw them end Ireland's Grand Slam hopes.
The three-way battle - who needs what?

Ireland

Wales' win and England's victory over Scotland mean there will be a four-way race for the Six Nations title on the final weekend.
England, Ireland and Wales are locked on six points with three wins, and England's points difference of 37 puts them top, ahead of Ireland's 33 and Wales' 12.
Wales are in action first on Saturday, 21 March away to Italy, Scotland then host Ireland, with England rounding off the tournament against France at Twickenham.
France can still win the tournament if Wales and Ireland lose and they beat England by seven points.
Davies says points difference could also be crucial to whether England or Wales qualify from their World Cup pool.
"If Wales play like they did against Ireland against England they will get out of the group," said Davies.
"Wales have to outmuscle England, but it might then come down to points difference, so who will score the most points against Uruguay and Fiji?
"So I think next weekend might be a good rehearsal for the World Cup."
