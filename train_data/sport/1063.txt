David Ginola withdraws from Fifa presidential race

David Ginola has withdrawn from the Fifa presidential race after failing to gain the minimum five nominations. The former France and Tottenham winger’s withdrawal was widely expected, and uncertainty continues over whether another prospective candidate, Jérôme Champagne, a former Fifa deputy general secretary, has secured the nominations.
Ginola, who was paid £250,000 by a bookmaker for his two-week campaign, said: “Having not obtained required five nominations by deadline I will not be able to continue with Fifa presidential candidacy. Just as I did as a player, I gave everything until the final whistle.”
Fifa will not publish the list of candidates for the presidency until next week despite the deadline having passed. Current president Sepp Blatter, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, Dutch federation president Michael van Praag, and former Portugal international Luis Figo have all secured the necessary number of nominations.
Blatter fired his opening salvo in his campaign for re-election by saying Australia deserve to host the World Cup and that it is an “unfortunate omission” the country has not done so before. Australia gained only one vote when bidding for the 2022 World Cup, which was won by Qatar, and some Fifa observers believe Blatter was the one member of the world governing body’s executive committee who did vote for them.
In his first column in Fifa Weekly magazine since confirming he will be a candidate for May’s election, Blatter said: “Australia is the only continent never to have hosted the World Cup finals, although the 1981 and 1993 Under-20 World Cups took place there. That is basically an unfortunate omission in sporting history because very few countries boast such a rich sporting culture and long list of champions.

“So we can say with confidence that it would be more than deserved if Australia were to stage the World Cup at some point.”
The Football Association announced on Thursday it was nominating Prince Ali, while the Scottish FA confirmed it had nominated Van Praag.
Figo confirmed he had submitted his candidacy and revealed six countries who had nominated him. They are: Portugal, Denmark, Montenegro, Macedonia, Luxembourg and Poland.
