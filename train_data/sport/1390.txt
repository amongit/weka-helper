Forest v Rotherham: Five talking points
Fit-again goalkeeper Dorus De Vries (back) returns while on-loan Swansea forward Modou Barrow has received international clearance.
Rotherham midfielder Lee Frecklington returns from a ban and attacker Danny Ward is fit after a foot injury.
Boss Steve Evans may recall fit-again captain Craig Morgan in defence.
A home victory would take Forest within eight points of the Championship play-off places with eight games to play.
Rotherham, meanwhile, will go nine points clear of the relegation places if they win.
