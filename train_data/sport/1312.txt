Rory McIlroy deserves to win Race to Dubai early, says Lee Westwood

Lee Westwood believes Rory McIlroy “deserves” to win this year’s European Tour’s order of merit, regardless of whether one of Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Marcel Siem triumphs in the next two events.
The trio need to prevail not only at the Turkish Airlines Open, which begins in Belek on Thursday, but also at next week’s season-ending DP World Tour Championship to have any chance of overhauling McIlroy’s lead in the money list.
Westwood, one of the eight Europe Ryder Cup team members teeing it up at the Maxx Royal Golf Course, warned the European Tour against trying to emulate the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup play-off series, which ensures their race goes to the final event.
“Occasionally somebody will do something extraordinary and deserves to win the money list a week early," Westwood said. “Over the last few years it’s seemed that whoever wins the Tour Championship, wins the FedExCup – that’s not ideal.
“I have no problems with the Race to Dubai being over before the final event, especially this year with what Rory has done. He’s won two majors, a World Golf Championship, and our flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship. That would be a good career, but he’s done it in six months.”

Meanwhile, Turkey is withdrawing its bid to stage the 2022 Ryder Cup and is focusing instead on staging the 2026 match. Ahmet Agaoglu, the president of the Turkish Golf Federation, revealed that it would need to cut down up to 15,000 trees to make one of the Belek venues suitable, which is not possible because of environmental laws. It will thus build a links-style course in the Antalya area, bringing the potential investment to £100 million .
That leaves Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain battling it out for 2022, with an announcement expected next autumn.
