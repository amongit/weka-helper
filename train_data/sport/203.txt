Wambach foregoing NWSL season to focus on World Cup
ELMA, N.Y. (AP) -- Abby Wambach is taking the season off from playing in the National Women's Soccer League to focus solely on representing the United States in the World Cup this summer.
Wambach made the announcement in a release issued Wednesday by her NWSL team, the Western New York Flash. At 34, the 2012 FIFA Women's World Player of the Year says she needs time to prepare mentally and physically to ''bring the World Cup back to the U.S.''
The U.S. opens the tournament against Australia on June 8 at Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Wambach is a six-time U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year, and is a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner. She holds the women's international career scoring record with 178 goals.
She spent the previous two seasons playing for her hometown Flash.
