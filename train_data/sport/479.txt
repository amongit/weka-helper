Gareth Bale booed again by Real Madrid fans

Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid has once again been cast into doubt after the Welshman was mercilessly booed by Los Blancos supporters during Tuesday night's Champions League defeat to Schalke.
Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was at a loss to explain the European champions' current stupor as they scraped into the last eight, 5-4 on aggregate, after losing 4-3 to Schalke at the Bernabeu.
Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema aside, none of Real's superstars played well but it was Bale and, to a certain extent, Iker Casillas, who received the most vitriol.

Sadly for Bale it's nothing new, after extending his run of games without a goal to nine matches. The former Tottenham midfielder has failed to ingratiate himself with Real's fickle fans and a forward pass completion rate of just 58.3 per cent, combined with a paltry 25 per cent success rate at one-on-ones, only served to increase the noise level.

In a recent poll conducted by Spanish newspaper AS, 46.1 per cent of supporters thought the club's Â£86m record signing should be cut from the team.
Almost half of around 3,000 answering the poll said they believed that if Real Madrid broke up their so-called 'BBC' (Bale, Benzema, Cristiano) front three, Bale should be the man to make way.

Incredibly, Ronaldo polled around a third of the vote and his anger was also there for all to see last night.
The Portugal international has declared "I wont talk again until the end of the season", cutting a frustrated figure with Los Blancos' form and fans.
Ronaldo twice equalised in the first-half against Schalke to surpass Real legend Raul with 78 goals in all European competitions, but he was still seen shouting at his team-mates and venting his fury as the night threatened to turn sour.
A 2-0, first-leg advantage was just enough to carry Los Blancos into the quarters for a fifth consecutive season on an evening when Ronaldo's achievement in becoming the all-time leading scorer in European competitions was overshadowed.

Ronaldo bagged a first-half brace to overtake Raul's tally after Christian Fuchs and Klass-Jan Huntelaar had given Schalke the lead.
Benzema then put Madrid in front on the night before Leroy Sane and a stunning strike from Huntelaar gave Schalke a deserved victory.

However, since the turn of the year they have lost five times in 15 games to surrender their La Liga lead to Barcelona and were on the verge of suffering one of the biggest shocks in Champions League history.
"We are playing very badly. It is quite incomprehensible after what we did until December," said Ancelotti.
"It is clear I feel very sorry because everyone has seen we played very badly. This is not good for the image of the club.

"It is normal that the players lack confidence. I think we have dipped a bit physically too. We had problems in every aspect of the game: offensive, defensive, desire, fight and concentration."
Ronaldo looked less than pleased as he left the field to jeers and whistles on 90 minutes and his vow of silence will raise concerns at Real that, once again, the club's most important player is unsettled.
Ancelotti was also forced to defend Ronaldo after the Portuguese's tantrum. "He scored two very important goals but the rest were not at his level," insisted the Italian.
