Brazil were brilliant in 1970, but Euro 2012 champions Spain have changed the way the game is played

Spain have completely altered the way the game is played because they don’t really have a formation they stick to.
They play with wonderful freedom, there are seven players in midfield and attack and you cannot say where any of them actually play in terms of a position. They just do what they blooming well like and go where they like, too.
Brazil played with wingers who stayed wide and strikers who played through the middle. They had four at the back and there was a structure to the side you could recognise.
They were probably the best team of that era, but it was their forward players who made them special.
Spain don’t play with any forwards and there isn’t a single player among the midfielders or strikers who can head the ball. You’ve never seen a team like that be successful before.

I played against Brazil in 1970, and they were a more attacking unit than Spain. Brazil had some fabulous players. Pele is the one everybody remembers, but they weren’t a one-man team. There was Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao – they all had the ability to be a match winner.
At Euro 2012 , Spain weren’t very adventurous in the group stages. They kept the ball very well, but they didn’t really attack in great numbers.
At times they looked quite blunt going forward – until the final. Brazil were always an attacking team who looked to put the opposition on the back foot by attacking them.
Spain try to put teams on the back foot by pressing them high up the pitch, trying to force the ball back to the goalkeeper so he has to kick it a long way down the pitch and they can get possession back again and keep it.
You also have to consider the conditions the two teams play in. Spain play on lovely smooth pitches, which enable them to pass the ball quickly. In 1970, Brazil were playing on all sorts of pitches, but they still managed to play attractive football.
It is incredibly hard to compare the two and say which one was better, Brazil of 1970 or Spain of 2012. They belong in different eras and Spain have revolutionised the way the game is played over the last few years.
Barcelona started it, but Spain have taken it on internationally. This Spanish team do not play the game like anyone else has played before. They have two centre-backs who play where the centre-backs play and they have a goalkeeper.
The rest just don’t have a set position, they play with a freedom and fluidity we’ve never seen before. I really enjoy watching them, but it’s different to what I knew in my days as a player. If my old school teacher saw us playing like that he would have blown his whistle and stopped the game. We’d have been playing 'walk football’ until all of us knew the position we were playing in and stuck to it.
The Spaniards don’t follow convention at all. Maybe they have changed the way the game is played forever, we shall see. At the moment, though, Spain are the best in the world and everyone else has got to try to find a way to beat them.
