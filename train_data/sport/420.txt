West Ham announced their record deal to take the Germany Under-21 international from Brescia on 26 Jan 2009 a week after David Sullivan and David Gold completed their takeover of the club from the collapsed Icelandic bank Straumur.
However, consistent with reports at the time, club managing director Karren Brady says the transfer had been arranged by the prior board. She is now looking into the circumstances of the deal. “Just before this board took over, the club paid a huge amount to Brescia for the German Under-21 who took part in a handful of matches and then departed for Fiorentina at a fraction of the price,” Brady wrote in her column in The Sun. “The deal is something I’m investigating.” There was no further comment from West Ham on the progress of the club’s inquiries.
