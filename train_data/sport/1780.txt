The Best Football Cocktails
For most people, "tailgating drinks" means cheap beer, or, if you're feeling extra-fancy, bourbon sipped out of a flask.
But this season, we'd like you to try stepping up your game and pairing the action on the gridiron with a different beverage: cocktails.
No matter if you're watching the NCAA or the pros, fix these six drinks while you pre-game this fall and winter. Now let's play some football!
Last February, we asked top Chicago bartender Mike Ryan to create an all-American punch for Super Bowl XLVII. And he came through with flying colors, delivering this autumnal elixir made from bourbon, apple brandy, sweet tea, grapefruit juice and baking spices. It’s ideal for a crowd, and if you’re a super-fan, you can serve it in a pair of (plastic-wrap-lined) football helmets.View recipe: Super Sunday Punch Bowl of Freedom
Use that cheap beer for this innovative concoction from Liquor.com advisory board member Simon Ford. It’s a combo of the classic Margarita with lager, yielding a tart, bubbly and refreshing tipple that still packs a kick. In fact, beer cocktails and football are a great pairing in general: The Michelada is always a favorite, matching a darker brew with lime and spice. (If you’re looking for a more complex creation, check out these recipes calling for craft beer.)View recipe: Lagerita
A light and bubbly Gin & Tonic might not seem like a manly football beverage—and this one’s pink! But the recipe comes from Brian McGregor, who’s both a top bartender in San Francisco and a die-hard Packers fan. And he says that this is his favorite football-watching drink.View recipe: Pink Plymouth Gin & Tonic
It seems like kickoff is getting ever earlier, and there’s nothing better for pre-noon imbibing than a Bloody Mary. This recipe, from celebrity chef Chris Cosentino, is seriously gourmet, with a homemade tomato-and-chile mix and a raw oyster on top. Want a more traditional Mary? Try Liquor.com advisory board member H. Joseph Ehrmann’s Elixir Bloody Mary, which he claims is the world’s best.View recipe: Bloody Roman(Photo courtesy Michael Harlan Turkell)
Tailgating is, of course, best done with a big group of friends. And making drinks for a crowd is best done in batches. We’re huge fans of this tequila-based recipe from Liquor.com advisory board member Dale DeGroff, which makes about 18 drinks at a time. Or for a more traditional punch, try the delicious gin-based Boat House Punch instead.View recipe: Margaritas by the Pitcher
For the hard-core fan (or the fantasy-football player) who watches games from morning to night, you need a low-alcohol tipple that you can sip all day long. We suggest this old-school concoction, which, according to Liquor.com advisory board member David Wondrich, people sipped all afternoon to keep cool back in the 1830s. It’s as delicious today as it was nearly 200 years ago.View recipe: Sherry Cobbler
