Warriors' Klay Thompson out 7-10 days with sprained ankle
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Another All-Star shooter will be sidelined when the NBA's top teams meet Wednesday night.
Golden State guard Klay Thompson will sit out against East-leading Atlanta with a sprained right ankle. The West-leading Warriors say Thompson will be re-evaluated in seven to 10 days.
Thompson turned his ankle awkwardly as he stepped on Tarik Black's foot in the third quarter of Golden State's 108-105 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. Thompson had his ankle re-taped in the locker room and returned in the fourth quarter, finishing with a game-high 26 points.
Hawks sharpshooter Kyle Korver is out at least another two games after breaking his nose in a win against the Lakers on Sunday. Korver went out after absorbing an offensive foul from Ed Davis.
