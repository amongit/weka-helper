Champions League trophy going on 3-stop tour in US
AMSTERDAM (AP) -- The Champions League trophy is going on tour in America.
The trophy, normally called the European Cup and nicknamed ''Big Ears'' because of its large handles, is awarded to the winner of each season's Champions League competition.
The tour will make stops in New York on Thursday and then head to Dallas on April 17-18 and finally Los Angeles on April 21-22, with fans given the chance to snap pictures of the famous chunk of silverware last won by Real Madrid.
The tour is being organized by Heineken, a Champions League sponsor that has sent the European Cup to Africa, Latin America and Asia in the past.
Heineken executive Hans Erik Tuijt says ''we're bringing the energy of the tournament from Europe, directly to U.S. fans.''
