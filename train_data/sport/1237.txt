Chelsea have lost their early-season swagger:

Jose Mourinho has spoken of creating a “new” Chelsea and that was certainly the case in the first half of the season, when they were killing teams off with the skill of Eden Hazard, the finesse of Cesc Fabregas and the finishing of Costa. But with trophies now up for grabs and every result vital, the Blues have become far more functional and are relying heavily on organisation and determination. Up against 10 men, Chelsea should have controlled the game against PSG but their passing was off and Costa had left his shooting boots at home. Mourinho will be eager for the goals to start flowing again.

David Luiz’s popularity at Stamford Bridge may have taken a hit:
Former Chelsea defender Luiz received a warm reception from the Stamford Bridge crowd ahead of kick-off and the Brazilian was always a popular figure around the club. But he became the pantomime villain of the return leg and was booed after scoring a late headed equaliser in normal time. Even before elbowing Costa, Luiz had clashed with the striker and refused a conciliatory handshake. After Ibrahimovic had been sent off, Luiz exchanged words with the Chelsea bench and told them: “We’ll win with 10 men.” He was later booked for trying to get Costa sent off.

Paris Saint-Germain were dirty but Mourinho's pre-match warning left its mark:
Mourinho had claimed that PSG were the dirtiest team his Chelsea side had faced this season in the first leg and the French side were arguably even more aggressive at Stamford Bridge. David Luiz got away with an elbow on Diego Costa, Edinson Cavani tripped the striker in the box but no penalty was given and Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti made numerous cynical fouls. But referee Bjorn Kuipers acted rashly to send off Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his late challenge on Oscar. There was no doubt it was a foul, but Kuipers may have had Mourinho’s pre-match words, as well as the appeals of the Chelsea players, ringing in his ears as he quickly reached for the red card.

Nemanja Matic is Chelsea’s rock:
Matic returned from suspension to the Chelsea midfield and once again proved to be the glue that holds Mourinho’s team together. PSG caused Chelsea plenty of problems before and after Ibrahimovic’s red card, but, time and again, Matic was on hand to produce a vital tackle or block. No wonder Cesc Fabregas loves playing next to Matic and no wonder Mourinho insisted he would “never, never, never” sell him. It was perhaps no coincidence that Matic had been forced off with an injury shortly before PSG found a late equaliser in normal time through Luiz.

Edinson Cavani does not like playing at Stamford Bridge:
Jose Mourinho must be relieved he didn’t act on interest in signing Cavani when he returned to Chelsea in the summer of 2013 because the striker seems to be cursed at Stamford Bridge. Cavani missed a wonderful chance to effectively knock Chelsea out of the Champions League last season, shooting over the bar with just goalkeeper Petr Cech to beat and the Uruguayan missed an even better opportunity this time around. Cavani looked sure to score after being sent through and rounding Thibaut Courtois, but somehow hit the post rather than the back of the net.
