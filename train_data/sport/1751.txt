RIGHT NEXT DOOR: Julia Landauer, Aspiring Nascar Driver

Little girls seldom fall in love with auto racing, but Landauer did -- and by age 10 was hooked on it. She now races in the Legends Series, a circuit just one level below official Nascar-sanctioned competition. Landauer's career goals are multifarious: to get more women involved in her overwhelmingly male sport, of course, but also to bring to high-speed auto racing the technology and business skills she picked up as a student at Stanford University. Brains, brawn and a groundbreaking spirit: The checkered flag is all hers.
