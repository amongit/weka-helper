Tony Verna, the man who invented a way to use instant replay for live sports, died on January 18 2015 at the age of 81.
Instant replay has been a staple of TV sports for the past five decades but it was used for the first time on December 7 1963, when Verna came up with a method for the Army v Navy American Football match in Philadelphia.
The concept was so new that when Army quarterback Rollie Stichweh scored a touchdown, announcer Lindsey Nelson had to warn viewers: "This is not live! Ladies and gentlemen, Army did not score again!"
In a glittering career in television, Verna also acted as producer and executive director for the Live Aid music concert in 1985. Verna recalled in 2004: "I was co-ordinating about 80 directors around the world, and it was a 16-hour marathon of top notch musical acts in London and Philadelphia, all for famine relief. Live Aid was thought up by Bob Geldof, and he got so many major stars to participate. It was a very complicated show with seven different worldwide feeds."
Verne was also proud of his work directing five Super Bowls, the Olympics, the Kentucky Derby and even the Pope John Paul II's Prayer for Peace, an event that required more than 100 television cameras.
Queen: their finest moment at Live Aid
Born Anthony F Verna in Philadelphia on November 26 1933, he first worked on local show Big Top and the original version of American Bandstand directed Pope John Paul II. But it is his invention of instant replay that will ensure his place in television history. "Not many things you can do in life where you can change the way things were happening before," Verna said. "I wanted to show what had happened and instantly and not wait until half-time. The first replay was black and white like a runaway train."
Verna figured out that he could use the spare technical tape (not the audio tape being fed into homes) and developed a method to cue the tape to pinpoint the play he wanted to immediately air again. He said he was looking for a way to fill those boring gaps between plays during a football telecast.
Verna died at his Palm Desert home after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He wrote five books about his life, including Instant Replay: the Day That Changed Sports Forever.
