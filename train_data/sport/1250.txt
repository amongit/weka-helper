Jonny Evans has insisted he did not deliberately spit at Papiss Cisse, saying he considers the act "low and cheap".
Evans was given a six-match ban by the Football Association after being found guilty of spitting at the Newcastle striker in the clubs' Premier League game on March 4.
Cisse was given a seven-match suspension for his part in the incident, which was widely condemned at the time, but Evans has emphatically maintained his innocence.
He told The Times: "I did not have the intent to spit at an opponent, so when the FA charged me with that I could never accept it.

"But I was able to go home and look my mum and dad in the eye because if I'd genuinely spat at someone I think they would have been disgusted in me."
Evans' ban rules him out of the clash with Liverpool at Anfield tomorrow, as United continue their pursuit of Champions League qualification.
