Six Nations 2015 review: Johnny Sexton gives George Ford a masterclass in game management

Ford will improve after being schooled by Sexton
One day George Ford will enjoy that performance by Johnny Sexton. The hurt is too acute for that to happen any time soon, the bruises all too raw, but Ford knows that he was witnessing at close-quarters a masterclass of game management by the Ireland fly-half. The control, the precision, the variety yet constancy, and the zeal – all that was there to be seen.
Ford is well on the way to becoming that self-same player. Perhaps even better. Remember it has taken Sexton years to get to this level himself. He too had to go through his apprenticeship, seeing how Ronan O’Gara ahead of him used to impose himself on a game. There are no short-cuts. And Ford knows that better than any.
It is not as if there was anything particularly flawed in his own game on Sunday. The Bath fly-half never shirked his duties, didn’t go into his shell under the ferocious pressure that Ireland exerted. It was more that he was on the back foot for long stretches with England losing the possession and territory count by 60-40.
Ford, too, is more of a running fly-half than Sexton. Or at least as Sexton is used by Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt. The orders are precise and they are carried out to the letter. Kick and turn. Kick and chase. Kick and pressurise.

World-class duo put Ford and Youngs in their place
Ford’s natural inclination is to give it a crack. England were guilty of chasing the game too hard too early. Perhaps their forward pack might not have managed to wrest control as they had done against Wales in Cardiff. But there was a sense in their isolated break-outs that they were going off-script too soon.
Even though this defeat was a distinct set-back for England, they can absorb the lessons pretty quickly. Ford has been at the heart of an upturn in their attacking game. And that will not disappear. Ford, though, will note how influential his opposite number was. It was no coincidence that England grew stronger after Sexton departed with a hamstring injury in the 53rd minute. His replacement, Ian Madigan, showed nothing like the same accuracy. That is a measure of how good Sexton was. As Ford will be. Mick Cleary

Schmidt has worked his magic on Zebo
If any more evidence were needed of the brilliance of Joe Schmidt’s coaching methods then look no further in the transformation in form and fortune of Simon Zebo.
When the Ireland wing burst onto the scene, he quickly established a reputation for flair and flamboyance. Injuries stalled that initial ascent but doubts also emerged whether he had the work rate to accompany the raw talent. He was thought to be defensively suspect and did not feature in a single matchday squad in last year’s Six Nations.

Clearly, England still thought him vulnerable and targeted him at seemingly every kick-off and a fair few more high balls. Zebo fielded them all expertly, using his dancing feet to set up usual platforms for Ireland to exit their own 22.
The highlight of his performance was his ferocious tackle on Anthony Watson that led to the turnover from which Conor Murray kicked to Robbie Henshaw for his try. Even if the 24-year-old rarely got the opportunity to make his mark in attack, his contribution did not go unnoticed by Schmidt.

“He’s a free-spirited young man who loves the game and he loves to be involved in the game,” the Ireland head coach said. “It’s a case of convincing all the players to keep that appetite to be involved as often as possible even if it’s not with the ball in your hand. I thought his kick-off take from the 22 drop-out was an exceptional take in the air.”
Where Schmidt has excelled is in getting Zebo to not only buy into those more mundane aspects of the game but to excel at them. Speaking last week, the Munster wing said: “The reason I stared rugby was the excitement I get out of those things like putting someone into space and scoring tries. At the end of the game if we win and I know a couple of slap-backs or regaining a high ball is gone along to winning the game, I'll be twice as happy as scoring a try.” Daniel Schofield

France's World Cup hopes are utterly threadbare
Once France were synonymous with subtlety and invention, but the side fashioned by Philippe Saint-André is one of lumpen predictability. They had no contingency when they fell behind to Wales, nothing in the way of crafty response. Their only solution was to send on the heavies, in the form of 24-stone prop Uini Atonio. How desperate their kicking game has become, too. Camille Lopez and Morgan Parra were equally hopeless, and the French looked to be crying out for a figure of the inspiration of the Frédéric Michalak. Seldom, if ever, can their World Cup hopes have been so threadbare. Oliver Brown

Wales show mettle for title chase
So are Wales real contenders now? At least they have the opportunity. Had England beaten Ireland you suspect that, with two home fixtures remaining for them, the title chase might have been all but over. Now, in a fortnight when Ireland visit Cardiff, Wales have a chance to upset the apple cart.
The noises from Wales on Saturday night were that they were improving game by game, that this was nothing unusual, that they always improve the longer they are together.

Well, they will have to improve again, and some more, to beat Ireland, especially as they have lost 11 of their last 14 Tests (with one draw) against them in Cardiff, but it is hardly beyond the realms of possibility.
Their set-piece was excellent in Paris, while both centres were in fine form, and their half-backs are now top-quality internationals. Leigh Halfpenny will kick goals all day and all night.

Decision time looms for peerless O'Connell
Such was the quality and significance of Ireland’s victory over England at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday that the issue of whether the match marked Paul O’Connell’s final game in a green shirt in Dublin was almost entirely overlooked.
Brian O’Driscoll’s final game at the Aviva Stadium last March in the victory over Italy included a choreographed banner thanking the Irish legend for his contribution to the sport.
O’Connell of course has yet to confirm whether he intends to retire after the World Cup later this year, but if Sunday was indeed to have been the Munsterman’s final home game, Ireland’s performance could not have provided a more fitting send-off, even without any sense of an emotional send-off or razzmatazz.
Ireland’s trip to Wales will mark the 35-year-old’s 100th cap for his country and yet he remains the heartbeat of Joe Schmidt’s side, typified by his relentless display in edging the forward battle that enabled Irish half-backs Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton to suffocate the life out of England with their kicking game.

But was it the former Lions captain's last in Dublin? “Eh, it could have been but I don’t know yet, I’m undecided,” O’Connell said.
“I’ll probably make the decision soon enough, I really want to play to the World Cup and be in the best shape I can there and see after that.
“That probably was my last Six Nations game against England in Dublin: there’s no point kidding myself too much.
“I’m not trying to make a big deal by not saying anything I just genuinely haven’t decided what to do yet. I’m really enjoying playing at the moment in the set-up we have in Ireland, but I’m conscious we have a lot of good second-rows coming through as well.
“The World Cup is a big focus for me to try to go there and be in as best shape as I can, and around then will be decision-time for me.”
Before then, there is a potential Grand Slam to chase, with trips to Wales and Scotland firmly in O’Connell’s sights.
O’Driscoll got the fairytale finish to his career with a dramatic Six Nations title win in Paris last season, and if this is to be O’Connell’s last year of Test rugby, few would deny him a similarly triumphant farewell. Gavin Mairs

Scotland are the Six Nations' Ikea wardrobe
As he nears the end of his first year as an international coach, Scotland’s Vern Cotter must be starting to think that his team was supplied by Ikea. All the bits and pieces seem to be there in the form of a quality crop of players, he has the tools and he has the instructions, but it is proving devilishly difficult to put everything together.

The match statistics suggested that Scotland should have beaten Italy with something to spare on Saturday, but they lost to the sucker punch of a last-minute penalty try. There were troubling echoes of 2012, Andy Robinson’s last year as Scotland coach, when he presided over their second Six Nations whitewash of the century. Cotter now looks destined to lead them to their third.
Ikea apparently provide a helpline for customers experiencing difficulty assembling their products. Would that international rugby offered one as well. Alasdair Reid

Hero of the weekend
Paul O'Connell: Ireland A dozen years after his first appearance against England, Sunday afternoon featured the second-row at his brutal best. With trips to Cardiff and Edinburgh to come it may also have been his last international on home soil, and if so it was the perfect way to sign off. A fine day for Ireland's talisman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Villain of the weekend
Camille Lopez: France The contrast between the two kickers in Paris could not have been starker. Leigh halfpenny knocked over five imperious penalties fo Wales but lopez was fatally wayward as his two missed kicks proved decisive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quote of the weekend
I' m obviously not getting the message across Scotland coach Vern Cotter is not a man of many words and the New Zealander's summary of his side's chastening home defeat by Italy was succinct. The Wooden Spoon surely beckons..

Try of the weekend
France v Wales When: 60th minute Who: Dan Biggar Wales' decisive try in Paris was a fine team effort as Dan Biggar profited from fine approach play by George North, Rhys Webb and a glorious offload by Dan Lydiate to scoe in the corner and end the French resistance.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stats of the weekend
