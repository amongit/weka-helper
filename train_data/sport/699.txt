- George North suffered three 'massive' blows to the head - Sam Warburton: Equalling Jones record as captain will be special - In pictures: Six Nations team of tournament - so far

FULL TIME: FRANCE 13 WALES 20



Dan Biggar's try helped seal a 20-13 victory for Wales in Paris
Wrap Wales have won in Paris again! Les Bleus cannot conjure up the converted score that would have denied Warren Gatland's side victory and after losing to England on the opening weekend of the Championship, they are now back in the title hunt. It was an attritional rather than fluent win today but Halfpenny mercilessly punished French indiscipline. See you next time!

<noframe>Twitter: tetsujin1979 - Congratulations Wales, but this is genuinely the worst French team I've seen <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23SixNations" target="_blank">#SixNations</a></noframe>
79 min France back in possession but they're closer to halfway than the Welsh line...
78 min Ball goes wide but Dulin knocks on after a crunching hit from Roberts...
77 min Rolling maul from the lineout and France are creeping towards the try line...
76 min Penalty to France near halfway. Lopez punts into touch, inside the Wales 22...
74 min Break in play as Lee receives treatment. Time is on Wales' side now but a converted try from Les Bleus will still rescue a share of the spoils for the home side.
<noframe>Twitter: Andrew S - Stade De France sounds like a deadly house party you can hear from your window at four in the morning <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
73 min WALES PENALTY! France 13 Wales 20. France are penalised for not being square in the scrum and Halfpenny does the business once again.

Dan Biggar scores a try for Wales
<noframe>Twitter: Jim Smyth - 4 games since the French scored a try against the welsh. Fantastic phaseplay and finishing. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
67 min FRANCE TRY! France 13 Wales 17. Les Bleus turn down the penalty and quick hands in midfield creates space for Dulin, who is strong and brave as he dives over at the corner and France are back in this game. Lopez knocks over a glorious touchline conversion and the lead is down to four points...
66 min France trying to lift the tempo as they prove in the Wales half. The ball is slow however and it all becomes rather pedestrian. The pressure though does yield a penalty...
64 min WALES PENALTY! France 6 Wales 17. Les Belus are pinged for side entry and Halfpenny plunges the knife even deeper with a beautiful penalty that sails high and handsome. Wales have an 11 point cushion now...
<noframe>Twitter: Jade Jones - Do I hear the French booing their own team? Tut tut! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
<noframe>Twitter: Arwyn Morgan - A bit of magic for the try by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Dan_Lydiate" target="_blank">@Dan_Lydiate</a> and a superb finish by Biggar <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
59 min WALES TRY! France 6 Wales 14. Great Wales try. Smart break around the fringes from Webb creates the space, Lydiate is on his shoulder in support and the flanker's deft passs sends Biggar scampering over in the corner. Halfpenny slips as he attempts the touchline conversion and misses.

58 min Unlucky! Biggar's drop goal attempt hits the left upright and bounces clear.
56 min Defensive lineout for France works well but the resulting rolling maul collapses and the referee decides that will be a Wales feed at the scrum...

<noframe>Twitter: Matthew - Morgan Parra comes of after a strong 12 mins in the second half. What is the point of that change?! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
51 min WALES PENALTY! France 6 Wales 9. The battle of the boot continues as Halfpenny knocks over his third penalty to give Wales a three-point advantage.
<noframe>Twitter: Tom - I love watching Morgan Parra play rugby. Absolute genius of a scrum-half. Best in the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
48 min FRANCE PENALTY! France 6 Wales 6. In typical style, France revert to Lopez for the penalty attempt and the fly-half is finally back on target with his effort from straight in front of the posts. We're all square in Paris.
47 min Brighter start to this half from France now as Parra starts to pull the strings and the Welsh defence is severely tested. Penalty to France for offside and Parra will have another crack...
<noframe>Twitter: Liam Murray - France miss someone like a Michalak. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nations2015" target="_blank">#6nations2015</a></noframe>
43 min Bastareaud almost bulldozes his way through but his effort is in vain as Peyper penalises France for obstruction.

41 min Wales are pinged for not rolling away. France opt for the kick at goal but this time it's Parra rather than Lopez who steps forward but he enjoys no better luck than his team-mate as his effort sails wide.
41 min Lopez gets the second half underway...
Wales head to the dressing room with their noses marginally in front. It's been a bit of a stalemate in the Stade de France so far and there's room for improvement from both sides. If it comes down to a battle of the kickers, Wales have their ace in the hole in Halfpenny while Lopez has been wayward.

<noframe>Twitter: Dai Lama - They're playing the theme tune to Friends. Told you the French are unpredictable.</noframe>

George North was unable to pierce breach the French defence in the first half
39 min Wales blatantly collpase the rolling maul and Peyper whistles. LOopex steps forwards but badly hooks his effort across the face of the posts. That's six points which have gone begging now.
<noframe>Twitter: Accenture Rugby - Being starved of possession has seen 5 French players yet to make a carry and 6 Welsh players yet to make a tackle. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a>.</noframe>

Camille Lopez on target for Les Bleus in the Stade de France
35 min North races down the right wing, beating two Frenchmen, but is eventually hauled down by Dulin. Close but no cigar.
32 min Huget scores - but doesn't! The wing touches down in the right hand corner but his smile quickly turns to a frown when our referee Jaco Peyper calls him back for an earlier forward pass.
31 min More Wales pressure as they move into the French 22 but this time the penalty goes to the home side and Lopez clears.
<noframe>Twitter: Richard Smedley - Halfpenny had no need of silent respect: 3-6 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nations" target="_blank">#6nations</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23rygbi" target="_blank">#rygbi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23cmoncymru" target="_blank">#cmoncymru</a></noframe>
28 min WALES PENALTY! France 3 Wales 6. Unlike Lopez, Halfpenny makes no mistake with his penalty to restore the lead for Warren Gatland's side.
26 min Attacking scrum to Wales eight metres shy of the France try line. A quick strike sees the ball moved wide at pace and North hit the line on the crash ball. Les Bleus defence stands firm but they then conceded the penalty for not releasing the player in the tackle.
<noframe>Twitter: Frankie Baker - Even game atm. Wales pressing well but France equally defending well <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23GoodBattle" target="_blank">#GoodBattle</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
24 min A quick tap penalty from Parra earns his side another penalty as Wales fail to retreat the 10 metres. That brings it into Lopez's range but the fly-half pushes it a metre wide.
21 min Yet another delay at scrum time and the Stade de France has gone very quiet at the moment. This game hasn't quite caught light just yet.

Leigh Halfpenny scored Wales' first points in Paris with a penalty
<noframe>Twitter: Daryl Sharpe - Camille Lopez looked a lot like he wanted a little snooze before that kick <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
17 min FRANCE PENALTY! France 3 Wales 3. Wales are caught offside at the scrum and Lopez levels up for France with a stylish swing of his trusty left boot.
15 min Another scrum and the two front rows are having an epic tussle at the moment. Wales's scrum however is holding up well so far.

12 min Lopez's cross field kick finds Huget, who taps it back into play superbly. He's aiming for Dulin but the flick almost finds the covering Halfpenny, who would have been away had he managed to gather the ball rather than knock on.
10 min Penalty to France but it's out of Lopez's range so he goes for touch deep in the Wales 22.
SScrum-half Morgan Parra returned to French side against Wales
<noframe>Twitter: Lizzie Hayward - What's happened to silence for the kickers?! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
6 min WALES PENALTY! France 0 Wales 3. Wales go through the phases and the French cannot resist the temptation to use hands at the ruck. Halfpenny steps forward and punishes them with a successful penalty.
5 min A typically muscular charge from Roberts gets Wales moving forward. France haul him down but without the power of Bastareaud today, Wales might have the edge in midfield.
3 min Wales win that scrum but as they go wide, France pinch the ball at the subsequent breakdown. Wales concede the penalty and Les Bleus go for touch through Lopez.
2 min First scrum of the match goes down, which is an ominous sign. The pitch is cutting up already...
<noframe>Twitter: â&dagger; Mr Westwood â&dagger; - Come on Wales lets thump &amp; destroy France, we already beaten them 3 in a row now lets make it 4 wins against them <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%236nations2015" target="_blank">#6nations2015</a></noframe>
1 min Game on, ladies and gentlemen. Dan Biggar puts boot to ball and we're underway in the Stade de France.
16.56 Teams out on the pitch, singing ensues and we're a couple of minutes away from kick-off in Paris...
<noframe>Twitter: Jenni - Wales and France are pretty even this year, still think France might trickle a win here... <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=hash&q=%23FRAvWAL" target="_blank">#FRAvWAL</a></noframe>
16.54 It’s been another tough week for Saint-Andre in the wake of the result against Ireland but the head coach is used to the pressure and was in stubbornly upbeat mood this week...
We made twice as many passes as the Irish, and we scored a try against the number three side in the world, the team that many are calling the best in Europe. We are not far away and we are working hard to get there."
16.52 Elsewhere, Bruce Dulin is preferred to Scott Spedding at full-back while Romain Taofifenua is named in the second row in place of Pascal Pape who is suspended after his errant knee did Jamie Heaslip a serious mischief in Dublin a fortnight ago. The other changes see Sofiane Guitone named on the wing while Morgan Parra has earned a recall at scrum-half for the injured Rory Kockott.
16.51 France coach Philippe Saint-Andre makes five changes and the chief sacrificial lamb is centre Mathieu Bastareaud, who has been dropped to the bench after his failure to punch through the Ireland midfield. He is replaced by Remy Lamerat.

Philippe Saint-Andre has made five changes to his XV to face Wales today

16.46 Gatland admitted this week it was a difficult team to select...
We have made some tough [selection] calls and there were some tight decisions but it is a very strong team we are putting out. We have a lot of strength in depth at second-row. It is a chance for Luke Charteris to get a start and we have been impressed with Bradley Davies as well. We felt we improved against Scotland and we are looking for another improvement this weekend.”
16.44 The aforementioned North comes back into the Wales XV in place of Alex Cuthbert and if you include his three appearances for the Lions, he’ll be playing his 50th Test today. The big Northampton wing is still only 22.North’s recall after his controversial concussion is one of the four changes made by Gatland. Samson Lee has recovered from his own concussion issues to replace Aaron Jarvis at tighthead, Scott Baldwin gets the nod over Richard Hibbard at hooker and Luke Charteris is preferred to Jake Ball in the second row.

Warren Gatland will be hoping to build on the win over Scotland a fortnight ago
16.41 The last time Warren Gatland’s side were in Paris in 2013, they came away with a 16-6 victory thanks to a late George North try to end an eight-match losing run and record their first success in the Stade de France for eight years. They followed that up with a 27-6 win over the French in Cardiff last year.
