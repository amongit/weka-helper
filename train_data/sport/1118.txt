Graeme McDowell declared the imminent announcement of Royal Portrush as the 2019 Open venue as "a dream come true".
The Daily Telegraph revealed a month ago that The Open will return to the Northern Irish club for the first time since 1951 and that the governing body would make the news official at the Amateur Championship, which takes place at Portrush next week.
A press conference has been called at the famous Dunluce links for Monday, which will also be attended by representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive. It is understood that a deal has been signed which will see at least three Opens at Portrush in the next 25 years. Two news holes will be built, as the 17th and 18th will be used for infrastructure.
McDowell grew up in the coastal town, as did the 2012 Open champion, Darren Clarke, and after signing for a 68, which gave him a share of the early lead at the US Open, McDowell spoke of his joy.
"Beautiful - it’s been a dream of mine since I was a child," McDowell said. “I’ve spent many an hour out on that course as a kid, dreaming of playing majors and to have Open Championship come to Portrush is is special stuff.

"I’m very proud of where I grew up. I’m very proud of the tradition and history there, and it speaks volumes about how far my country has come."
Since the successful hosting of the 2012 Irish Open, the R&A had become convinced that Portrush possessed the required finance and conviction. The influence of McDowell, Clarke and Rory McIlroy has also been important with all three lobbying the R&A. It is believed Birkdale will be the 2017 hosts with Carnoustie in 2018.
