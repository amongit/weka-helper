South African pace bowler Alfonso Thomas will captain Somerset in limited-overs cricket this summer.
Although former England opener Marcus Trescothick, the county captain, will lead the team in County Championship games, Thomas, 38, will do the job in the T20 Blast and the One-Day Cup.
"Alfonso has tasted success in the IPL, the BPL and the Big Bash," said director of cricket Matt Maynard.
"He's played a huge amount of T20 cricket both here and abroad."
Alfonso Thomas will become the third South African to captain the county, following in the footsteps of Jimmy Cook - who skippered the team on one occasion in 1991 - and Graeme Smith (2005).
Thomas, who had to undergo surgery after breaking his ankle while playing golf in October, arrived in English county cricket in 2007 with Warwickshire, before moving to Somerset for the 2008 season.
He has taken 279 first-class wickets for the county, enjoying his best season in 2014 when he claimed 53 Championship scalps, becoming the first Somerset bowler ever to take four wickets in four balls.
He has skippered Somerset before, but only in a stand-in capacity, having led the team in seven first-class, four List 'A' and 29 T20 matches, the highlight of which was leading Somerset to the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2011.
