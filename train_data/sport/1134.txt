Nadal def Smyczek 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 7-5
12.41 Anyway, after nearly five hours of blogging, I will sign off. Goodbye, and thanks for joining me on what was a thoroughly enjoyable match.
12.39 So next up for Nadal is the Israeli world No 106 Dudi Sela, who knocked out Rafa's Wimbledon 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosol earlier today. But I expect the Spaniard will not be thinking about that match right now, and will just be hoping he can get back to something approaching full fitness in the next couple of days. After watching today's match and seeing how badly Nadal was suffering, it's hard to imagine he'll be able to win the tournament, but that was a supreme effort from him and he deserves enormous credit for toughing it out. Smyczek also played excellently, and belied his lowly 112 world ranking - hard to believe the 27-year-old has had such a journeyman career. You do just wonder whether he ever fully believed he was going to win this match though, and maybe that was his undoing. 12.27 Nadal is cagey about exactly what was wrong with him, but admits he was suffering from cramp, and that the humidity was a real problem. The height of Rafa's eyebrow below tells you just how perplexing that match was for him.

Nadal def Smyczek 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 7-5 Tim nets with a forehand to make it 15-0, and a perfect overhead from the Spaniard gets him to 30-0. There's then an extraordinary bit of sportsmaship from Smyczek as he allows Nadal a first serve after he was put off with his delivery and misses. Tim then puts a return into the net, and it's three match points to Nadal. The 2009 Aussie Open winner can't take the first one as he nets a forehand, and the seocnd one always goes a-begging as Tim produces a tremendous forehand up the line to keep himself alive. And what do you know, the third one has also gone as Rafa nets with a forehand error - we're back to deuce! but what a way for Nadal to reply as he smashes a backhand winner up the line to give himself a fourth match point. And he's taken it! He falls to the ground in delight, responding as if he's won a major. NADAL HOLDS AND WINS THE MATCH 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 7-5!
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-5 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Rafa moves up to 0-15 after a Tim error, and that becomes 0-30 when Nadal produces a sensational backhand pass from about six feet behind the baseline. That could prove to be a match-winning shot, but what a fantastic reply from the American who bashes a forehand winner crosscourt to make it 15-30. Rafa though is producing his best tennis of the match, and he gets himself two break points with an unbelievably good forehand pass. He just needs the one after Smyczek nets a forehand, and he gets himself the first break of the final set. NADAL BREAKS AND WILL SERVE FOR THE MATCH!

Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 5-5 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) A bruising Nadal backhand winner starts the game, and Tim is long with a return to make it 30-0. A strong forehand from the Spaniard gets him up to 40-0, and a backhand winner wraps up a love game as we enter the fifth hour of the match.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 4-5 Smyczek (* denotes next server) So, so impresssive from Smyczek as he refuses to buckle and moves up to 30-0 with a couple of huge forehands. His next shot is slightly off though and it flies wide to make it 30-15, before Rafa has the crowd on their feet with a tremendous running forehand winner. That was a wonderful shot to get it back to 30-30, and Rafa has a big chance to go up break point, but is just long with his forehand. He can't make the next service return, and it's game Smyczek.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 4-4 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Remember there'll be no tiebreak at the end of the set, and we're almost at the four-hour mark. Odd start to the game as Tim looks like he's going to challenge a Rafa serve but doesn't and ends up fluffing his return to make it 15-0. The reponse from the American is outstanding though as he knifes a backhand winner crosscourt, and then moves up 15-30 with a stinging backhand down the line. Nadal is teetering on the brink here, but he gets it back to 30-30 with that customary left-handed serve swinging out wide on the ad court that Tim can't return. The next point from Rafa is even better as he unleashes a forehand from outside the tramlines that's too hot for Smyczek to handle, and he moves up to advantage! Tim isn't losing this game without a fight though, and he rips a forehand winner return off a pretty weak Nadal second serve. Back to deuce. The next serve is much better from Nadal and it kicks like a mule into Tim's body, leaving the American unable to return it. Another awkward serve is too much for Tim, and it's game Nadal.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 3-4 Smyczek (* denotes next server) It's crucial seventh game time. Rafa moves up 0-15 after a Tim error, and although Smyczek wins the next point, Rafa gets a 15-30 lead after a badly-chosen drop shot from the American. A big serve has us back at 30-30 before a Tim error gifts Nadal a break point at 30-40, but he misses his backhand return off a second serve - the world No 3 looks furious with himself. He's even more angry now as two more backhand errors hand his American opponent the game.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 3-3 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) The Spaniard is quickly at 30-0 after a couple of unreturnable serves, and that becomes 40-0 when Smyczek goes wide with a forehand. Nadal then secures the love service hold with a booming forehand winner!
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 2-3 Smyczek (* denotes next server) The crowd are chanting 'Timmy' to try and get the American going, and it seems to work on the first point of the game as Smyczek swats away a backhand winner. He follows that up with a service winner, and after Nadal goes long with his return, the qualifier finds himself at 40-0. He wraps the game up with an ace, and we remain on serve in this fifth and final set.

Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 2-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) A dreadful backhand from Rafa flies long to gift Tim the first point of the game, but the response is terrific as Nadal produces an excellent backhand and then an ace down the T to move up 30-15. Smyczek can't get his return back on the next two points, and it's game Nadal.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 1-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Rafa at full stretch produces a great forehand, and it presents him an easy putaway on the next shot. The following point is fantastic, and ends with both players at the net, with Tim coming out on top with a well-placed forehand volley. The American then produces an even better pair of shots as he wins the next two points with first a backhand and then a forehand winner. An ace wraps up the game, and the level from both players now is the highest it's been all match.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 1-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) A little bit of energy looks to have returned to the Nadal legs, and he thuds away a forehand winner down the line to make it 15-0. The players exchange errors in the next two points to move Rafa up to 30-15, before Tim produces a forehand winner return to make it 30-30. A half-chance presents itself to Smyczek but he gets a little carried away and goes long with a makeable backhand to make it 40-30. A Nadal forehand error has us at deuce, before the Spaniard responds with a solid point to go up advantage after a couple of punishing forehands. Rafa then produces one of those trademark runnning forehands down the line, and it flies away for a winner to wrap up the game and level the set.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 0-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Strong start to the set from Tim, who wins the first couple of points after some stinging shots, but Rafa has us back at 30-15 with a backhand return winner. Nadal then goes wide with his return, but Tim can't close the game out and it's back at 40-30. Nadal then produces probably his best backhand of the match with a blistering backhand winner down the line to make it deuce. It gets better for Nadal as he rips away a forehand winner off a decent Smyczek serve to get himself a break point. But Tim won't go away and it's deuce when Nadal goes into the net with a forehand. Rafa gets another break point chance when the American nets a forehand, but again Tim responds well and swats away a forehand for his 51st winner of the match. Back to deuce, and the qualifier moves to advantage up when Nadal puts a forehand well wide. A big serve then wraps up the game for Tim, and that is a huge hold! SMYCZEK SAVES TWO BREAK POINTS AND HOLDS SERVE!
11.26 huge effort from Nadal to win that set. The key question now is whether Rafa will keep going for his shots in the all-or-nothing way he did throughout that fourth set.

Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Remember Nadal made a mess of serving for the third set, and he starts his attempt here poorly as well, netting an easy forehand. It's back to 15-15 though when Tim misses a backhand, and that becomes 30-15 when Tim floats a forehand long. The American then has us back on level terms with a forehand winner down the line to make it 30-30, but he loses his footing at a crucial point to hand Nadal a set point at 40-30. Rafa takes it when Tim nets a backhand return, and we're level at two sets all! NADAL WINS THE FOURTH SET 6-3!
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 5-3 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Tim starts the game with an ace, and a Nadal return error makes it 30-0. A long backhand has us at 40-0 before a forehand winner wraps up a love game for Tim. NADAL TO SERVE FOR THE SET.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 5-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Nadal starts the game with a double fault, but gets it back to 15-15 with a strong serve. An excellent return from Tim though forces Nadal into an error to make it 15-30, before the American goes wide with a backhand to make it 30-30. A long forehand from Tim makes it 40-30, and when he can't get back a swinging serve out wide, it's game Nadal. Supreme effort here from the 14-time Grand Slam winner.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 4-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) For the record, I think Rafa will break this game. Well, he's won the first point after Tim hits the net with a forehand to make it 0-15. Tim responds with a big serve to make it 15-15, but he nets a volley to make it 15-30and it's 15-40 when the American goes wide with a forehand. Two break points for Rafa! And he takes it at the first attempt when Tim nets a backhand. I was right. NADAL BREAKS!
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 3-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Rafa is grateful to see Tim hit a forehand into the net to give him a 15-0 lead, and the Spaniard takes the next point with an absolute ripper of a forehand winner. Nadal follows that up with another huge forehand to make it 40-0, but an error into the net sees us back at 40-15. Tim is long with a forehand though, and Nadal holds. This match incidentally is reminiscent of last year's final against Wawrinka when Nadal was similarly suffering badly from injury. He couldn't quite pull it off that day, but he's hanging in there for now.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 2-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) The pair exchange the first couple of points, before Rafa moves up to 15-30 when he rips a forehand down the line that Tim can't do anything with. Nadal is really having to go for his shots, but he can't do anything on the next point as he sees an ace fly past him. At 30-30, Nadal looks in control but somehow Tim finds the backhand pass crosscourt, and the Spaniard looks absolutely devastated. An ace follows, and Nadal is bent over looking as if he's about to be sick. Painful to see Rafa looking so unwell.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 2-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Nadal begins the game with a horrible double fault, but gets back to 15-15 when Tim nets a return. The crowd are depserately trying to get Rafa going, but he is struggling badly out there. The Spaniard is mightily relieved when a Smyczek backhand is just wide, and he then comes up with a wonderfully weighted backhand drop shot to make it 40-15. An ace down the middle wraps up the game, and Rafa is hanging in. Incidentally look at the veins on Smyczek! Really wonderful veins.

Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 1-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Smyczek is purring, and he moves up to 30-0 with a couple of winners, before making it 40-0 with an ace down the T. Another ace follows, and that's game Smyczek. The pressure continues to pile up on Nadal.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7), 1-0 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Good start from Rafa as he forces Tim into an error on the first point of the set, before the American is just wide with an almost Nadal-esque forehand down the line. The world No 3 then makes it 40-0 with a whipped crosscourt forehand, which is more like the Nadal we know and love. Smyczek responds with a backhand winner, and he looks so at ease out there at the moment. But the Spaniard is really going for it now, and he takes the game after a pair of bruising forehands.
10.49 Nadal is of the court again, and he has a huge job on his hands to come back now - the Spaniard looks spent, but we've seen him retrieve these sort of situations before. Even though Nadal doesn't look right, Smyczek deserves an enormous amount of credit - he hasn't stopped going for his shots, and he's kept up such a high level for most of the second and third sets. Anyway, Rafa is back on court, and the third set is underway - Nadal to serve.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 (2-7) Smyczek (* denotes next server) Tim wins the first point with a big serve, and moves a mini-break up with a wonderful volley to go 2-0 up. Rafa is forced to try and quicken up the points, and he forces Tim into an error when rushes to the net, which makes it 2-1 Smyczek. The American then makes it 3-1 with a backhand winner down the line that he hit with both feet off the ground - shades of Marcelo Rios in that one. It quickly becomes 4-1 Smyczek when Nadal goes wide with a forehand, and Rafa is doubled over in pain. But the 2009 Aussie Open champion responds the only way he knows how, with a brutal forehand winner that reduces the deficit to 4-2. But Tim is not intimidated by that, and he replies with a forehand winner to get the second mini-break and make it 5-2. Two serves for Tim to win the set... and he wins the first point with another forehand winner to go up 6-2, and give himself four set points. He only needs one, as he wraps it up with an ace! SMYCZEK WINS THE TIEBREAK 7-2!
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 6-6 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Tim wins the first point of the game after another great pair of forehands, and he's now won 13 out of the last 16 points. Rafa levels with a big serve that Smyczek can't get back, and the Spaniard moves to 30-15 up when Tim nets a backhand. Possibly the point of the match then follows as Tim manages to somehow flick back a forehand from behind him, but Nadal is there at the net to flick away the volley. Both players fully deserve the standing ovation they recieve, and a Nadal smash wraps up the game. It's tiebreak time...
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 5-6 Smyczek (* denotes next server) The players exchange the first couple of points of the game, before Tim moves up 40-15 when Nadal throws in another couple of errors. The Spaniard responds with a backhand return winner crosscourt to make it 40-30, but it's game Smyczek when Nadal goes wide with a backhand. This is turning into an excellent match, and this set really is impossible to call now.

Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 5-5 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) So, can Rafa serve it out? He starts the game inauspiciously as he leans over the back boards and spits rather aggressively. The first point is equally questionable from Nadal, who goes miles long with a loopy forehand. Tim then hits one of the shots of the match as he chases down a Nadal shot and rips the backhand passing shot down the line. Absolutely brilliant! The next point goes Rafa's way though after the Tiger nets a forehand. Well, if that previous backhand from Tim was good, this last one was even better. He plays a glorious drop shot which Nadal can't get to, and it's two break points! And a double fault hands Tim the break - the third time he's done that on break point. We're back on serve! SMYCZEK BREAKS!
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 5-4 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Great play from Tim gets him to 30-0 courtesy of an ace and a backhand passing shot winner. Another ace follows to make it 40-0, and it's game Smyczek when Nadal is wide with a backhand. An easy service game at last, and Rafa will serve for a two set to one lead.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 5-3 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Good response to losing that break from Tim, as he wins the first point of the game with a backhand winner down the line. It gets better for Smyczek - he moves 0-30 up when he hits a perfectly executed forehand winner down the line. Nadal responds in kind with a killer crosscourt forehand, prompting a call of 'too good' from Tiger Tim. But on the next point it's Tim who's too good, and he gets himself two break points with another forehand winner (his 15th of the match). Nadal puts in a big serve on the first break point to get back to 30-40, and he saves the second one when Tim is forced to go wide with an attempted backhand pass. Nadal keeps up the momentum to move advantage up after a whipped forehand down the line, and an ace seals out wide the game. Big, big hold that.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 4-3 Smyczek (* denotes next server) This is so nicely poised now - both players have won 69 points - and we're into crucial seventh game time. A poor Nadal return gifts Tim a 15-0 lead, but an equally tight Smyczek returns the favour with a forehand that sails long to make it 15-15. Rafa then rolls back the years with a forehand winner down the line that just gets quicker and quicker, and bends away from his opponent. Agian though, he can't back it up and a forehand error makes it 30-30, before another service-forehand winner one-two punch from Tim takes him to 40-30. Smyczek though is long with a backhand, as he fails to control a loopy 'moon-ball' forehand return from Rafa. It's then break point Rafa after a very well-judged backhand volley, and Nadal celebrates with a big fist pump. Tremendous response from Tim though, as he smashes away a really tough forehand winner crosscourt. The American then nets a forehand though to give Nadal another break point chance, but he saves it with a another brilliant forehand winner. Again though Tim makes a poor error, and it's a third break point of the game, which Nadal takes when Smyczek misses an easy forehand volley. That could be a really big moment here. NADAL BREAKS!

Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 3-3 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Smyczek continues to set the pace here, and goes 15-0 up after another couple of crushing groundstrokes. Tim misses a backhand up the line though to make it 15-15, and an excellent Nadal volley gets the Spaniard to 30-15. Rafa then nets a forehand to make it 30-30, and neither player can get an easy service hold this set. A big 'come on' (not 'vamos' that time I think) follows as Nadal goes 40-30 up with a service winner, and he holds when Tim nets a backhand return.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 2-3 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Rafa mishits his return on the first point of the game, but it bamboozles Tim, and he hits a forehand into the net to hand Nadal a 0-15 lead. Smyczek wins the next point with a beautifully-struck backhand crosscourt winner, and moves up 30-15 when Nadal hits the bottom of the net with a forehand on the run. Rafa responds in style though, as following a Tim error, he whips a forehand winner to move up 30-40 and give himself another break point. He can't take it though, going wide with a forehand down the line to make it deuce, and Tim goes advantage up when he forces Nadal into a backhand error. An ace out wide follows, and it's game Smyczek.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 2-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) The first point of the game doesn't bode well for Nadal, as he miscues a forehand to fall behind 0-15. A good response sees him level things at 15-15 with a solid serve-and-volley point, and it's 30-15 when Tim misses with a backhand. Smyczek really needs to hold his nerve now, and see just how bad the world No 3 is feeling. Nadal moves up 40-15 when Tim can't chase down a volley, and it's game Nadal after a service winner.
09.50 The plot thickens as Rafa calls for the trainer - he does not look well at all. The sweat is dripping off him, and he's shaking his head complaining of dizzyness. What a horrible morning this is turning out to be for Nadal, but he's back on court and we're underway again.
Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 1-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) My, oh my, Tim wins the first point of the game with a scintillating forehand winner down the line, and it's 30-0 after another forehand winner. Rafa responds with a backhand return winner, and a weak forehand error from Smyczek has us at 30-30, before a horrible smash from the American goes wide and it's break point Nadal at 30-40. How costly will that prove? Very. Nadal breaks back with an easy forehand put-away after Tim's backhand clips the net. NADAL BREAKS BACK!
Nadal 6-2, 3-6, 0-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Smyczek is long with a backhand to start the game off as Nadal takes a 15-0 lead. A pair of double faults from Rafa then gifts Tim a 15-30 lead, and this is extraordinarily poor from the Spaniard. A big 'vamos' follows, as Nadal finally gets a serve in and smashes away a forehand volley after a strong approach. He is pretty pumped right now, it's fair to say, and he moves to 40-30 up when Tim dumps a volley into the net. A brilliant forehand return from Smyczek - his best of the match - gets it to deuce, before Nadal moves up to advantage after being forced to hit a couple of awkward overheads. He still can't wrap the game up though as he misses a forehand into the tramlines and it's back to deuce. Oh wow, Tim moves break point up with a backhand that flies into the corner, and he's taken it with a ripped crosscourt forehand. Oh my, this is sensational! SMYCZEK BREAKS!

Nadal* 6-2, 3-6, 0-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Rafa changed his top at the end of that set, and he's come out looking very determined - beginning the game with a crushing backhand return winner. Tim responds with a good serve to level up at 15-15 though, and Nadal hits the bottom of the net with a poor forehand. So strange to see these sort of errors coming off the Rafa racket. Smyczek then goes long with a backhand to make it 30-30, but another Rafa forehand error makes it 40-30. A double fault (his first of the match) allows Nadal back to deuce, before the world No 3 whips a backhand return that Tim can do nothing with, and it's break point Nadal. He can't take it though, as he chucks in, you've guessed it, a backhand error. A long forehand hands Smyczek the advantage, and the American wins another mini-battle to hold serve with a forehand winner down the line. For the first time in the match, the qualifier is ahead on the scoreboard.
09.28 Wow, this match has really been turned on its head - two breaks of serve in a row see Smyczek level things up at one-set all, and amazingly Nadal has lost eight points in a row on his own serve. Both players are currently having a 'comfort' break, and there'll much to ponder for the Spaniard in the gents toilets. He's making so many errors at the moment, and Tim is scampering around the court chasing everything down. To use a greg Rusedski-sim, the American qualifier is currently 'outphysicalising' Nadal.
Nadal 6-2, 3-6 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Yet another Nadal backhand hits the net to start the game, and it's 0-15. A net cord then set Tim up for a crosscourt that he swats away crosscourt to move up 0-30 - he's moving so well at the moment. Another Nadal backhand hits the net, and it's three set points for Tim! He takes the first one, with a beautiful forehand down the line! SMYCZEK BREAKS AND TAKES THE SECOND SET 6-3!
Nadal* 6-2, 3-5 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Can Tim consolidate the break this time? He just needs to hold serve twice to level up the match. Easy, right? Well, he's started in style, with an ace down the T, and an unreturnable delivery swinging out wide to the Rafa backhand to move up 30-0. Tim's then wayward with a forehand to make it 30-15, and Rafa is growling 'vamos' to himself. But this is stunning stuff from Tim and he moves up 40-15 when he outlasts Nadal in a punishing rally as the Spaniard is forced into a forehand error. Rafa responds in style to make it 40-30 when he rips away a crosscourt forehand, and it's deuce when Smyczek can't return a backhand that lands at his feat. The American's back to advantage up when Nadal goes long with a backhand, and it's game Tim when Nadal nets a backhand!
Nadal 6-2, 3-4 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Wow, it's 0-30 after Nadal misses a forehand and then fluffs a smash that allows Tim to rip a forehand pass down the line. And what do you know? It's 0-40, when Rafa goes long with a backhand. Three break points for Tim! And he only needs one - another double fault from the Spaniard gifts it to Smyczek. SMYCZEK BREAKS!

Nadal* 6-2, 3-3 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Superb couple of points from Tim get him to 30-0 - both are the classic one-two punch of a big serve followed by a forehand winner. A 200-kmh ace follows to make it 40-0, before the American errs with a backhand to make it 40-15. Nadal hits a backhand long though and it's game Smyczek - we're into crucial seventh game territory.
Nadal 6-2, 3-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) The Rafa backhand is starting to work a lot better, and it gets him to 30-0 when he moves Tim all over the court on the first couple of points. A big serve from Nadal gets him to 40-0, and it's a love game when Tim nets a forehand after another turbo-charged Nadal backhand.
Nadal* 6-2, 2-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) This is more like it from the American, who races into a 40-0 lead with a couple of service winners and a strong volley. Rafa won't go away easily this game though, and it's 40-30 after Nadal does that incredible lasoo-like whip thing with a couple of forehands. But the world No 3 then misses a backhand volley, and it's game Tiger Tim (I'm assuming that is indeed his nickname).
09.02 Aussie Nick Kyrgios is into the third round, beating Ivo Karlovic in four sets. That's a huge win for the home favourite.
Nadal 6-2, 2-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Losing that service break straight away looks to have deflated Tim a little, and Rafa moves up 15-0 when Smyczek hits a backhand into the net. Rafa though is in an oddly generous modd today though, and goes long with a forehand to make it 15-15. He's quickly back up to 30-15, but nets a forehand to make it 30-30. A decent serve forces Tim to go wide with his forehand return to make it 40-30, and it's quickly game Nadal when the American can't retrieve a Nadal forehand. Well, Tim really needed to consolidate that break - something Henman's old coach David Felgate used to harp on about. Commentator Chris Bradnam is obsessed with how much Nadal is sweating by the way.
Nadal* 6-2, 1-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Not the ideal way to start trying to consolidate a break as an error gifts Nadal a 0-15 lead. Fair play to the American though, he responds with a superb forehand volley to make it 15-15. Rafa responds in style though with an off-forehand that rips through the court and past Tim. The point of the match so far follows, as Rafa chases down a Tim volley to push one down the line, which the qualifier gets to and whips crosscourt for a forehand winner to make it 30-30. He moves up 40-30 when Nadal goes wide with a forehand, but it's back to deuce when Tim nets a forehand. I think it's the first deuce of the match. Tim loses patience in the next point, and hurriedly hits a forehand long to gift Nadal a break point. He then does exactly the same in the following point, and it's game Nadal. NADAL BREAKS BACK!
Nadal 6-2, 0-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) A great return from Tiger Tim gets us to 15-15 after Rafa won the first point of the game with a service winner. Nadal then moves up 30-15 after Tim misses a forehand, but a stunnning backhand from the American has us back at 30-30. Rafa is then way long with a pretty regulation backhand, and Smyczek has his first break point of the match. And Rafa throws in a double fault at 30-40 - game Smyczek! SMYCZEK BREAKS!
08.46 This is what Tim looks like incidentally, though of course we all knew already.

Nadal* 6-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Nadal's backhand clicks into gear, and he forces Tim into an error on the fisrt point to move up 0-15. Smyczek then misses a forehand by the tinest of margins, and it's 0-30 - his face when seeing the hawkeye replay was something to behold. He then goes long with a forehand volley, and it's 0-40 - three set points. Tim saves the first one when he chases down an overhit Rafa drop-volley, but Rafa wraps it up with a crushing crosscourt. That took just 31 minutes, and the Spaniard is looking very comfortable here. NADAL WINS THE FIRST SET 6-2!
Nadal 5-2 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) There's a hint of Pete Sampras in the the first point of the game, as Rafa flies into the air and delivers the 'slam dunk' smash, before moving up 30-0 when Tim misses a return. Rafa's still making more errors than you'd expect though and he goes long with a backhand to make it 30-15 - it looks as though he's flattened out that backhand, which may be contributing to a few of these errors. Tim returns the favour to make it 40-15, but Rafa goes wide with a forehand which he hit well off-balance. There's then a great point to finish a game, as Tim hoists up a decent lob, which Rafa lets bounce and hears a fan shout 'finish him'. Rafa duly does, as he swats it away to wrap up the game.
Nadal* 4-2 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Tim moves up 15-0 with a big serve, but it's quickly back to 15-15 when Nadal cracks a forehand return. Two big serves get the American up to 40-15, before a lovely serve-and-volley point wrap up the game. How nice it is to see a bit of s and v - be good to see him trying more of that throughout the match.

Nadal 4-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) This could become a bit of a struggle for Smyczek, but he gains a foothold in the game when Nadal misses a forehand to make it 15-15. A superb backhand from Rafa is then challenged by Tim, but it clipped the line and Nadal moves up to 30-15. The score quickly becomes 40-15 after Tim can't do anything with an attempted pass, but Nadal is then wayward with a forehand to make it 40-30. It's game Nadal when he smashes a forehand down the line, which Smyczek can do nothing with.
Nadal* 3-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Rafa's definitely finding his groove now, and he races to 0-30 ahead after cracking a couple of brutal forehands. It gets worse for Tim when he hits a forehand way long to gift Rafa three break points at 0-40. Tim saves the first when he rushes to the net off a forehand, and Rafa hits the bottom of the net with an attempted pass. But it's only a stay of execution as Rafa takes the break at the second opportunity as he picks up a net cord and buries the forehand down the line. NADAL BREAKS!
08.23 Meanwhile, Roger Federer hit out at a TV camerman during his win against Simone Bolelli for filming his blistered hand Is Roger finally losing his cool?
Nadal 2-1 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) The first really long rally of the match ends with Nadal pushing a backhand wide to go down 0-15, before he levels things up with a forehand volley. "Like a cat" is the ever strange-sounding Virginia Wade's assessment. Nadal then starts to get the whip on his forehand, and moves up 40-15 after forcing Tim into a couple of errors. A wild forehand return from the American then flies wide, and it's game Nadal. Is Roger finally losing his cool?
Nadal* 1-1 Smyczek (* denotes next server) Great stuff from Tim as he smashes an ace down the T before throwing in a couple of service winners to move up 40-0. A lovely crosscourt forehand wraps up the game in no time at all.
Nadal 1-0 Smyczek* (* denotes next server) Tim nets with a forehand on the first point, before Rafa returns the favour with two forehand errors to make it 15-30. Hmm, very uncharacteristic. Tim gets a look at a pretty weak first serve but goes long with a backhand approach, and it's back to 30-30. Another backhand error from the American gives Nadal a 40-30 lead, and the Spaniard seals the game when a Tim backhand sails long.
08.11 We're underway, Rafa to serve...
08.10 I wonder if Smyczek is nicknamed Tiger Tim, let me know if you have the answer to that one.
08.07 The players are out on court, and Nadal is wearing a very fetching pink number, coupled with a lime green wristband and headband combo. In fact it's the very same outfit you can see in the picture at the top of this article.
07.55 Good morning everybody, welcome to our liveblog of this second round Australian Open match between Rafael Nadal and Tim Smyczek.
Rafa has been suffering with various injuries since the second half of last year, but played some excellent stuff in thrashing Mikhail Youzhny in the first round on Monday.
His opponent today Tim Smyczek is a relative unknown, but this much I can tell you: he is ranked 112 in the world, and has never played Nadal at any level. When the Spaniard was asked about his opponent he said "I don't know him very well”. Well done for not even trying to pretend Rafa.
And here are a couple of stats:
Nadal has never lost in the second round of the Australian Open
Smyczek’s best performance at a grand slam came in 2013’s US Open, when hereached the third round for the first and only time in his career.
