Neymar was involved in a post-match confrontation with a Manchester City supporter by stewards after being substituted in Barcelona's 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium.
The Brazilian forward was targeted for verbal abuse by a Portuguese-speaking fan, wearing a Manchester City scarf, during the closing stages of the Champions League round of 16 first leg.
Stewards rushed to usher away the supporter before Neymar responded to his tormentor by blowing a kiss before heading down the tunnel.

Neymar attempted to play down the incident after the match. He was quoted in the Brazilian media saying "I was just playing with him. He began to curse me and I ended up mocking him."

Neymar did not reveal what the fan had said but suggested the fan swore at him.
"What he told me? I can not repeat it, no. My mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me."
