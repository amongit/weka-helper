World Athletics 2011: Fantastic Farah wins world gold
Britain's Mo Farah wins gold in the 5,000m at the World Championships in Daegu, holding off Bernard Lagat and Ethiopia's Imane Merga in a dramatic last lap.
Farah put behind any disappointment he might have felt after he was caught on the line in the 10,000m earlier in the week to win in 13 minutes, 23.36.
