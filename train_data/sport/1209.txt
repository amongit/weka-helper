Manuel Pellegrini has insisted he will see out his Manchester City contract and remain as manager next season, despite claims from his agent that he will consider a summer move to Napoli.
The Chilean, whose future will be assessed by City’s Abu Dhabi hierarchy at the end of the season if the club fails to retain the Premier League title, is under contract at the Etihad until June 2016.
But with uncertainty surrounding his future, Pellegrini’s agent, Jesus Martinez, has claimed in Italy that the former Real Madrid, Villarreal and Malaga coach could replace Rafael Benitez at Napoli if he becomes available this summer.

“Manuel has another year on his contract, and he intends to respect it,” Martinez told Radio CRC. “I don't know, however, what the leadership's intentions are.
"Pellegrini has Italian roots, he's also been on holiday in Naples. He's a lover of language and culture. He greatly appreciates Italy and Neapolitan culture.
"You never know in football. Could he replace Benitez? Pellegrini does not allow me to talk about him in relation to a position at a club which already has a coach under contract.
"We have to wait a few more months, then if [Napoli President Aurelio] De Laurentiis calls, we'll discuss it."

However, Pellegrini rejected those suggestions by claiming he will stay at City and look to extend his contract if offered a new deal.
“The situation with my future is easy,” Pellegrini said. I have a contract here until June 2016 and will fulfil my contract here.
"I always try to finish my contract for the years I have signed it for. I am very happy here and don't have any problems. But you never know what can happen in the future.
“But if I can extend contract, I will extend it. I am very happy, I don’t have any problems.

Pellegrini refused to confirm that captain Vincent Kompany would return to the City team at Burnley on Saturday after being dropped against Leicester last week.
But he insisted he has concerns over team spirit following reports of a dressing-room bust-up between Kompany and Fernandinho at Liverpool recently.

"It is normal,” Pellegrini said. “That happened a lot of days ago and it is of no importance. The squad is absolutely together.
“We don't worry about what newspapers want to write about. There are no problems with the players or in the dressing room."
