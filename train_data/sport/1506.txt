Fans turn out for Red Bull's homecoming parade
Formula 1 world champions Red Bull Racing parade their cars through the streets of Milton Keynes, close to where their factory is based.
Double world champion Sebastian Vettel and his team-mate Mark Webber take to the streets in their world championship-winning cars, and team principal Christian Horner thanks the council for closing off roads in the town centre on "one of the busiest shopping days of the year".
