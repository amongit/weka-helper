The Fierce Five On 'Big Brother': McKayla Maroney And More US Gymnasts Will Appear On CBS Show
This week on "Big Brother" (Sundays at 8:30 p.m. ET and Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS), two houseguests will meet five very fierce and special guests.
The 2012 Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team a.k.a. the Fierce Five -- McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, Gabrielle Douglas, Kyla Ross and Jordyn Wieber -- will surprise houseguest Shane, who wins the luxury prize, and Danielle, who he invites to join him. And as the photo here indicates, they'll do their best "not impressed" looks.
The "Big Brother" houseguests will also face two separate evictions this week, one during the Wednesday, September 12 episode and the second during the Thursday, September 13 episode. The final three left standing will compete for the $500,000 grand prize and the title of "Big Brother" Season 14 winner.
Tune in for the Fierce Five on "Big Brother" on Wednesday, September 12 at 8 p.m. ET.
