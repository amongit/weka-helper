Roberto Mancini says Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini is 'lucky'

Manuel Pellegrini was "lucky" to inherit a strong Manchester City side and should be winning titles every year, says former boss Roberto Mancini.
City are behind Chelsea in the Premier League and trail Barcelona 2-1 heading into the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, with Pellegrini's future the subject of much speculation.
"Pellegrini was lucky because he got a strong team," Mancini told CNN.
"I think City should and must try to win a title every year."
Mancini, now in charge at Inter Milan, was sacked by the Blues in 2012, a year after winning the Premier League title.
Roberto Mancini has won a total of 25 trophies - 13 as a player and 12 as a manager
But despite the Italian's comments, Pellegrini - who has spent £172.1m on players since he was appointed City boss in June 2013 - insists he is not feeling any pressure.
"I respect all opinions but I don't think my seat is in danger," said the City manager.
"We're second in the Premier League, still playing strong and are going to fight to prove it."
Pellegrini, who has a three-year contract at the Etihad Stadium, enjoyed a successful debut season in England, winning the Premier League title and the League Cup.
But despite spending £32m on Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala last summer, and signing Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony for £28m in January, City have struggled to find consistency this season.
They were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship Middlesbrough and lost in the League Cup to Newcastle .
Pellegrini's side have won only three of their last 11 games in all competitions and defeat to Burnley on Saturday left them five points adrift of Chelsea in the Premier League title race.
There are suggestions that only victory at Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium on Wednesday and progress in the Champion League will keep the 61-year-old in a job.
Pellegrini added: "It is very important for our team to prove we are one of the best teams in Europe but the only way to prove it is to beat a big team. That must be our mentality and this is our test."
