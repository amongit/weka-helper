New Zealand have appointed Dimitri Mascarenhas as bowling coach for their tour of England in May and June.
The former England all-rounder is currently the head coach of the SBS Otago Volts in New Zealand.
"I came to New Zealand with high ambitions for my coaching so to achieve a position like this is hugely satisfying," Mascarenhas, 37, said.
The Black Caps face England in two Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match in May and June.
1st Test: Lord's, 21-25 May
2nd Test: Headingley, 29 May-2 June
1st ODI: Edgbaston, 9 June
2nd ODI: The Oval, 12 June
3rd ODI: The Rose Bowl, 14 June
4th ODI: Trent Bridge, 17 June
5th ODI: Chester-le-Street, 20 June
Only T20I: Old Trafford, 23 June
The former Hampshire captain, who played 20 ODIs and 14 T20s for England between 2007 and 2009, replaces current New Zealand bowling coach Shane Bond, who will leave the role at the end of the World Cup.
He has initially been appointed on an "interim" basis and New Zealand Cricket will decide whether to make the role permanent before the tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa in July.
Mascarenhas, who spent 17 seasons with Hampshire before his retirement from county cricket in 2013, hopes his experience of English conditions will be an asset to the Black Caps.
"I am newly out of the scene there as a player and I know most of the guys in the current team very well," he said.
"The new guys I have played a lot with in county cricket and I know all the grounds we are playing at intimately so those factors will be useful in terms of the scouting and bowling plans."
Test bowlers Tim Southee and Trent Boult are among nine New Zealand internationals who have contracts with Indian Premier League teams. The 2015 IPL runs from 8 April until 24 May, while New Zealand's first Test against England starts on 21 May.
New Zealand Cricket has set a deadline of 19 May for their Test players with IPL contracts to report for duty.
Dimitri Mascarenhas played for Hobart Hurricanes, Kings XI Punjab, Melbourne Stars, Otago, Rajasthan Royals, Rangpur Riders, and Wellington as well as for Hampshire
Dimitri Mascarenhas holds the record for most runs for England in an over in an ODI. He scored 30 off Yuvraj Singh against India at the Oval in 2007
