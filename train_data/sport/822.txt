Six Nations: England must be ruthless to avoid eclipse

The sporting ticker tape will stretch across three great European cities on Saturday afternoon, from Rome to Edinburgh and on to London, bringing with it tales of noble deeds as well as grievous failings with the final output shortly before 7pm declaring the champion side of the 2015 Six Nations Championship. Wales, Ireland, England or France.
One word will be inscribed, countless emotions bound up in it, significant consequences unleashed. Abrupt, brutal, definitive – that is where this unprecedented day is heading. Light for one team, darkness for the others, rugby’s very own solar eclipse.
The narrative will be constantly updated, the shifting sands of respective fortunes noted, and it will make for a remarkable rugby fest stretching from lunchtime into the evening schedules. Never before have four sides had a shot at the title on the closing day. Only once before, in 2007, have all three matches had a bearing on the winners of the RBS Six Nations trophy.

This is Judgment Day 2015, a churning, captivating spectacle.
The scheduling favours England, so too the points difference. And there is the rather important matter of home advantage.
Forwards coach Graham Rowntree captured the mood at Twickenham on Friday as England wrapped up their preparations.
Graham Rowntree puts the forwards through their paces
“I want France to come here and feel they are playing against a nation, not just 15 guys on the field,” said Rowntree, with echoes of the 1995 World Cup final when Mandela’s Rainbow Nation came together. The rallying cry has been sent out to Twickenham Man to shed his inhibitions, to boogie in his Barbour.
• Our experts predict the Six Nations winners • England must lay down a World Cup marker • We rank the World Cup's 20 nations with six months to go
So much lies within England’s grasp yet their reach may have to be extended as never before if they are to get their hands on a trophy that has proved beyond them in three years under Stuart Lancaster, his side having to make do with the runners-up slot on each occasion. There is some merit in that status but no consolation. And at the fourth time of asking such an outcome will be seen as a singular failure.
Their rivals will not cede an inch of turf. Their task is to make England’s as difficult as it can be, to put them under pressure as they head down the tunnel shortly before 5 o’clock, informed but far from impregnable. No matter how much has been said about focusing on performance, on the match reality in front of them, on how to stop the beastly French ruining their parade, news of events from afar will have filtered through. And little voices will whisper somewhere in the subconscious. This is no ordinary assignment no matter protestations to the contrary.

If Wales have done as England themselves did 12 months ago and posted a half-century of points on Italy, with a margin of victory of 41, then the challenge will have been well and truly laid down. Wales fans flooded into Rome yesterday, massed ranks of them offering up their hymns and arias for miraculous outcomes. Given that fate has already felled Italy captain Sergio Parisse, their prayers are having an effect. The Azzurri without Parisse is like the Vatican without its Pope. Wales have every chance of getting this shakedown day off to a tumultuous start.
In what mood will Ireland go to Murrayfield? Tormented by their experiences at the Millennium Stadium last weekend when the Grand Slam was stopped in its tracks by a wall of red Welsh shirts, or spurred to even greater efforts to ensure that their title is defended to the last breath? Scotland are spurred by an emotion at the other end of the spectrum, that of possible humiliation, the deadbeat echo of a wooden spoon reverberating in their soul for another year if they lose.
Ireland have impressed but not seduced. They have scored only four tries, one of them a penalty try, and their tightly orchestrated game will probably have to be loosened if they are to register the requisite points.

And so to England. In many ways, the World Cup itself starts here for England. There will be no second chances in six months’ time such is the unforgiving nature of their group. Twickenham will host sudden-death rugby from the start, just as it will stage a match of such meaning on Saturday.
This is a dress rehearsal with the need to stage a perfect production.
Anything less than victory will be a notable setback for England, not only to their own plans but to the entire tournament. The present will have a major bearing on what happens in September, if only as far as setting the mood music. Silverware is the booty they need to bag.
Philippe Saint-Andre's France are far from vintage Les Bleus
Respectful caps have been duly doffed to the opposition. Yes, yes, France have to be beaten. At some point, though, victory alone may well not be enough. That is when ruthless England have to emerge. That is when champions reveal themselves. England have to be proactive, the killer instinct locked and loaded from first whistle. George Ford has to kick goals in the manner that Leigh Halfpenny did against Ireland in the early stages, setting the tone and settling the game there and then. Then the try-scoring machine can begin to whirr, more efficiently than it did against Scotland.
• Six reasons why Wales will win the Six Nations • Six reasons why Ireland will win the Six Nations • Six reasons why England will win the Six Nations
Remember this is not a vintage France, full of attacking verve. Their record is as bad as it has ever been, with Philippe Saint-André’s tenure bottoming out at a 41 per cent win ratio. Factor in, too, that he is starting his 16th half-back combination in 37 Tests.
And if this were not enough, France are on their knees after a shattering few days, playing last Sunday, returning to Paris on Monday night, and heading for Twickenham on Friday morning. They are not in tip-top condition, and England will look to run away with it in the closing stages.
England will look to get Jonathan Joseph on the ball as often as possible
Yet France’s defence is the meanest in the competition, alongside that of Ireland, and we saw how little success England had in Dublin. French flanker Bernard le Roux will be chopping and disrupting aided by the incomparable Thierry Dusautoir.
England know they have to quell the French pack, which looks a tad suspect in that they have no specialist loosehead on the bench. They know, too, they have to be disciplined. They know they have to take chances on offer.
England have not lost in the Six Nations at Twickenham in three years. France have not won there in the championship for a decade.
So much is in England’s favour. But sport has never paid much heed to logic. The tale of the ticker tape promises to make for a dramatic read.
