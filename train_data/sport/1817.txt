Epke Zonderland Wins Olympic Gold Medal In High Bar
LONDON (AP) — Epke Zonderland's acrobatic high bar routine earned him an equally lofty prize: an Olympic gold medal.

The gold was the first by a Dutch man in artistic gymnastics, and only the second for the country. The other? A gold by the women's team back in 1928.

When Zonderland saw his mark of 16.533 — a number not usually seen outside the vault — he pointed at the scoreboard. The crowd roared, and his fellow competitors lined up to congratulate him.

Germany's Fabian Hambuechen won the silver medal and defending Olympic champion Zou Kai got the bronze.

Danell Leyva was fifth and Jonathan Horton sixth.
