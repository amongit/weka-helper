The Manchester City supporter involved in the touchline row with Barcelona's Neymar during Tuesday's Champions League tie has claimed he "did nothing wrong" and says the Brazilian was "unprofessional" to react to the "diving gesture to annoy him".
Aziz Hammad, a 19-year-old Manchester University student and Manchester City season-ticket holder, has described his confrontation with Neymar.
“Neymar stared at me for a few seconds and looked to see if his manager was watching," Hammad told the Manchester Evening News after the 2-1 first-leg defeat.

“Then he gestured for me to come over but straight away the [final] whistle went. Then he came over and put his face right in my face. I didn’t know whether he was going to push me or what he was going to do.

“He was saying something to me in either Portuguese or Spanish but I couldn’t understand him,
"I kept doing the diving gesture to annoy him. Then the stewards pulled me away and he went down the tunnel.”
“I didn’t do anything wrong, I just did what all the other fans were doing.
I don’t speak Portuguese," Hammad added, in contradiction to Neymar's post-match claim that he had been abused by the fan in his native Portuguese tongue.
“That came from the upper tier when he was substituted in the 80th minute.
“All I did was make the diving gesture straight after the penalty.
“Throughout football he is known for being a diver and half of the stadium were probably doing the same thing. And that’s normal.
“If you are a professional, you expect to expect to be goaded by the home fans. That’s football.
“But he has singled me out because I was stood up.
“I think he was angry about the other incident and has taken it out on me. He was very unprofessional.
“But I don’t want to be in danger of losing my season ticket and want to make it clear I did nothing wrong.”
“It wasn’t a very serious incident” he said. “But I hope he wouldn’t react like that again.”
Manchester City lost the first leg after conceding two first-half goals to Luis Suárez, before claiming a goal back through Sergio Aguero. Barcelona's Lionel Messi had a penalty saved by Joe Hart in the dying moments.
