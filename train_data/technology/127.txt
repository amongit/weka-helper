India startup sees niche in presentation tool for mobile roadwarriors
Portable devices are surging all over the world, mobile technology is consuming every aspect of our lives, not only as consumers but also as professionals. Every single day, many businesses empower use of mobile devices for simple aspects such as delivering power packed presentations to clinch that sale, drive that business showcase and mobile devices are more than just media consumption outlets. That's what this Bangalore based startup, deck.in is capitalizing on.
Being a global mobile data warrior
They have built a mobile-first app called "deck" that lets everyone effortlessly create amazing presentations on any device without requiring any design skills whatsoever. The idea behind their app is that even though presentation apps have been around for decades now, it is still very difficult for "normal" people to create beautiful presentations.
This app changes that by removing all design decisions and formatting affordances from the purview of the user and lets them focus completely on crafting their content. The app then generates a beautiful presentation with a single click with their one-touch design. Sumanth Raghavendra, founder of Deck App Technologies gives us more details about this startup and how they aspire to change the process of making presentations for your business.
It also frees up users from all design and formatting decisions and lets them focus only on their content. Once the user has crafted their story, they have a grand total of one design decision to make. Selecting a presentation theme from a built-in library. Each theme is unique and guaranteed to support the story with great graphics, typography and animation to help the users show off a beautiful presentation that will inform, educate and impress their audience.
