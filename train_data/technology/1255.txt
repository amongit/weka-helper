Twitter targets SMBs with new quick promote feature

Twitter is putting a lot of focus this week on expanding its Promoted Tweets service and monetizing its ad platform.
Yesterday the company announced that Promoted Tweets can now run on other websites and apps, and then today, the social network introduced a "quick promote" feature targeting SMBs.

With quick promote, small businesses using Twitter's analytics dashboard can pick their best performing tweets and have them automatically targeted to an audience that is most likely to be interested in what they're saying. The process is "quick" in that it can be done in just a few clicks, Twitter said.
Previously, SMBs looking to make an ad buy had to do so using Twitter's self-service platform. While that option is still available, Twitter is likely betting that the analytics page will bring in more SMB dollars.
Overall, the quick promote rollout looks like a direct result of Twitter's tailored audiences, which it announced last December. The name of the service pretty much sums up its functionality: it tips advertisers off to a Twitter user's history of app usage, installs, in-app purchases and sign-ups. In turn, advertisers can use that data to target their marketing content as they push through campaigns.
While Twitter doesn't break out specific figures about its SMB users, social network is clearly trying to grow revenue in that particular segment. In the blog post explaining quick promote, Twitter product manager Buster Benson said the company's data suggests "users who see a relevant Promoted Tweet from an SMB are also 32 percent more likely to visit that business."
