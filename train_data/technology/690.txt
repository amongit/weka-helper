Emerson to build thermal management research center
The 21st Century Data Center
More than ever, data centers run the world, but many of them need a 21st century reboot. Today’s data centers have to be more efficient, redundant, and flexible than ever. We examine when and how to best run your own data center versus when to outsource to the cloud or a service provider, and when to take a hybrid approach.
Slated to open in late 2015 on the campus of the University of Dayton, the Emerson Innovation Center — aka the Helix — will be a 38,500 sq. ft. research and development space dedicated to five key areas of HVACR (Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration) technologies.
Emerson’s $35 million investment will employ 30-50 people when it opens, and allow them to do collaborative research with the School of Engineering in the areas of supermarket refrigeration, food service operations, residential connected homes, datacenter cooling and light commercial buildings.
Each of the defined markets will have their own dedicated research space, with the Emerson Network Power division providing the Advanced Thermal Management Technology for Data Centers module. This dedicated module will be focusing on how datacenters can optimize cooling technologies by improving energy efficiency, maximizing free cooling techniques, and protecting mission-critical processes.
Emerson will be equipping the R&D facility with their Liebert ICOM intelligent cooling technology and the DSE-pumped refrigerant economization technology. The equipment is designed to combine the use of free air cooling in a non-traditional way, providing an economizer model that makes use of external cooling without directly introducing outside air into the datacenter environment.
According to John Schneider, vice president and general manager, Thermal Management, “The complex, dynamic nature of today’s datacenter requires more than just new cooling technologies. The research facility will foster an ambitious, collaborative approach to conducting research and developing innovative thermal management technologies and intelligent controls that address the challenges facing data center managers.”
