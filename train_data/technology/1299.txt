​Google stops selling the Nexus 5
Google has stopped selling the Nexus 5 smartphone in its hardware shop.
Google began selling the LG-made Nexus 5 in 2014 through its own online channels. Now that seems to have come to an end: the Nexus 5 page on the Google Store website says it's "no longer available for purchase" and the buy button is now greyed out with text reading "not available".
ZDNet has asked Google for confirmation that it has stopped selling the Nexus 5 and will update the story if it receives one. A company spokesperson told The Verge that while some inventory still exists with its retail and carrier partners, Google is focusing on the Nexus 6.
A search for the Nexus 5 on the Google Store will now return results for the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, as well as related accessories for the two devices. However, both 16GB and 32GB Nexus 5 handsets can still be acquired through retailers such as Amazon.

The device's exit from Google Store wasn't unexpected and followed reports in December that Google had stopped production of the Nexus 5 and would continue selling it on the Google Store only through the first quarter of 2015.
The Nexus 5's low cost and reasonable specs made it a popular device, particularly with consumers keen on getting the latest versions of Android first.
While the Nexus 5 is on the way out, a new piece of Google kit - the next generation of Chromebook Pixel - was unveiled on Wednesday. The two new Pixel editions are available in the US for $999 and $1299. Unlike the first edition, however, they won't be made immediately available in the UK. The launch came on the heels of Apple's release of a new MacBook earlier this week.
Google also launched a new online hardware store called Google Store. Google Play now only sells apps, music, movies, TV shows, books, and magazines, while Google Store will sell phones, tablets, watches, Chromebooks, Nest and Wear devices, media streaming devices, and accessories.
Google yesterday launched its first physical retail outlet - a shop space inside UK retailer brand Currys PC World - in London.
