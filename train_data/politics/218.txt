Everyone wants to know if Sen. Ted Cruz is going to run for president in 2016, but that doesn't mean the Texas Republican is going to answer the question directly.
Asked on CBS' Face the Nation if he will seek the White House, Cruz politely sidestepped Bob Schieffer as the show's host tried to pin down the senator on his future plans.
"My focus is on the challenges facing the country right now," Cruz said. "My focus is standing and fighting right now in the Senate."
Cruz added that he's concerned about economic growth and "abuse of power" by President Obama, but did not specify what he meant. The Texan, now starting his second year in the Senate, exploded onto the national scene last year with his fight to defund Obama's health care law.
As for another potential 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, Cruz said he's "rooting" for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to get past the bridge scandal that has dominated political headlines for weeks. Christie fired his deputy chief of staff and cut ties to a political ally when e-mails showed his aides and appointees were involved in revenge-motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge.
"I like Chris Christie," Cruz said, using words such as "brash," "outspoken" and "effective leader" to describe the New Jersey governor.
