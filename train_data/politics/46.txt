Benghazi committee chair: No guarantee we have all Clinton e-mails we’re entitled to
Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. (Susan Walsh/AP) Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of a special House panel on the 2012 Benghazi attacks, said former secretary of state Hillary Clinton should turn over her private e-mail server to a third party to ensure that she has disclosed all necessary work-related correspondence. Clinton held a news conference last week to address some of the mounting questions over her exclusive use of a personal e-mail account while secretary of state. She said that there were no security breaches to her private account, which was connected to her family server in Chappaqua, N.Y., and that she would not provide the server for review. Many, including Gowdy, criticized her comments. Gowdy immediately called on Clinton to allow a "neutral, detached third-party arbiter" to access her server. In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," he said questions remain over how Clinton and her lawyers selected which e-mails would be deemed public business. "I have no guarantee that we have everything we're entitled to," Gowdy said. He suggested that public pressure, or requests from third-party members such as a retired judge, an archivist or an inspector general, could lead to Clinton providing access to her server. Otherwise, the House may be forced to go to court to gain access, he said. "The House has no business looking at purely personal e-mails, but by the same token, she doesn't get to decide what is purely personal and what is public," Gowdy said. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), also a member of the committee, said on "Fox News Sunday" after Gowdy's interview that Republicans are politicizing the issue to delay her testimony before the committee into the presidential cycle. Clinton is expected to launch her 2016 presidential campaign this spring. "Let's be fair about this — we are talking about investigation on Benghazi, right? What does this have to do with Benghazi? And the answer is absolutely nothing," Schiff said. "This committee has long since departed from being a committee about Benghazi. It's now a special investigation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Otherwise what possible relevance does that have on Benghazi?" Schiff also noted that Jeb Bush, a Republican 2016 presidential hopeful, used his personal e-mail as Florida governor. The Washington Post recently reported that Bush used his private account to discuss security and military issues. Jack Quinn, former White House counsel to Bill Clinton, pointed to The Post's story and noted a double standard. "We apparently trusted Governor Bush. We trust federal employees every day of the year to make these determinations. Why would we think it's important to bring in a third party to make a determination when she has outlined ... the methods by which they sorted these e-mails?" Quinn said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "If there was any kind of systematic wrongdoing in the sorting of these things into personal and official, it will come out. So I very, very seriously doubt any of the lawyers involved in this could have" messed around with it, he said.
