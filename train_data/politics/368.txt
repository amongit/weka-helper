AAP gains 25 pc vote share, 39 seats at the cost of Congress; BJP's vote share intact
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's oft-repeated slogan of a Congress-'mukt' Bharat has cost his own Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dear in the Delhi Assembly elections. With Delhi becoming Congress-mukt, it has gone to help Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
For the first time in Indian political history, the Congress failed to open its account in any Assembly election which it contested. The drubbing Congress got can be gauged from the fact that its face in the Delhi Assembly elections Ajay Maken, who was the party's Campaign Committee chairperson, also lost miserably from Sadar Bazar constituency. Owning responsibility for the debacle, Maken immediately resigned from the post of party's national general secretary.
But Congress' loss has been AAP's gain and a greater loss for the BJP. A glance at the vote share of the three main political parties - AAP, BJP and Congress - in the 2013 and 2015 elections makes it clear that, as feared by the BJP, the votes of the Congress have got transferred to AAP. The vote share of AAP rose by 24.81 per cent and it gained an impressive 39 seats.
In 2013 Assembly election, the BJP had polled 26,04,100 votes (33.07 per cent) and bagged 31 seats. In 2015 it got 28,02,552 (32.2 per cent) votes and won 3 seats.
In 2013 AAP had polled 23,22,330 (29.49 per cent) and bagged 28 seats. In 2015 it polled 47,39,924 votes (54.3 per cent) and won 67 seats.
In 2013 Congress had polled 19,32,933 votes (24.55 per cent) and won 8 seats. In 2015 it polled 8,40,283 votes (9.8 per cent) and failed to open account.
In 2013 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Mayawati had got 4,20,926 (5.35 per cent) votes. In 2015 it got 1,14,200 (1.3 per cent) votes.
The BJP's vote share reduced by just 0.87 per cent as compared with the 2013 elections. But its seats dipped by 28 seats.
However, the vote shares of Congress and BSP saw a remarkable downward slide. Their votes got shifted to AAP, resulting in a landslide victory to the newest party among all. While the vote share of Congress reduced by 14.75 per cent votes, the BSP's vote share came down by 4.05 per cent. The Congress lost all the seats it had won in 2013.
AAP not only got the 18.80 per cent combined vote share of Congress and BSP but also of the other smaller parties and independents. Its vote share rose by 24.81 per cent and it gained an impressive 39 seats.
The BJP had wished that the Congress at least kept its vote share intact if not lost them so that AAP's vote share could have kept low. But an AAP wave not only made Delhi Congress-mukt but also decimated the BJP.
