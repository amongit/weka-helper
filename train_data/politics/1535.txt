Clint Eastwood Speaks Out On Republican National Convention Speech
Clint Eastwood is standing by his memorable Republican National Convention speech, insisting that he doesn't care about the reaction to his unusual stand-up routine at last month's gathering in Tampa.
"One advantage of being my age is that you know what can they do to ya?" Eastwood said in an interview with CNN. "You just have fun and do what you think and then you can say what you think, you don't have to edit yourself."
Eastwood caused a stir on the last night of the Republican convention when he gave a rambling, at times incoherent speech targeted at President Obama, whom Eastwood pretended was seated in an empty chair next to him.
"What do you want me to tell Romney?" Eastwood asked the invisible Obama. "I can't tell him to do that. I can't tell him to do that to himself. You're crazy, you're absolutely crazy. You're getting as bad as Biden. Of course we all know Biden is the intellect of the Democratic party."
Many considered Eastwood's speech to be the highlight of the convention, overshadowing Mitt Romney's speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination.
When asked by CNN if he regretted the speech, Clint Eastwood shook his head no, and noted that Romney enjoyed the speech.
"He did," Eastwood said. "He's got a much better sense of humor than people think. He actually thought it was quite funny."
Eastwood rebuked the notion that he was being disrespectful to Obama, stating that he wanted to get across the point that "there needs to be more work done" in Washington.
"You don't have to idolize these people," Eastwood said. "They're there to do a job for you. If they're not doing their job, you have to evaluate that in your own mind."
